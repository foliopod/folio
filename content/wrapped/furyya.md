the final episode of the [furyya](https://oddpress.itch.io/furyya) series went live today!! i picked the game up a few months ago because it looked cool as hell, obviously. when its designer, uoshi, got brought on as the layout artist for [galactic & going rogue](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galacticgoingrogue/galactic-and-going-rogue-two-ttrpgs-of-war-among-the-stars) i thought it would be fun to have the series overlap with that crowdfunder!!

this series took 27 hours to edit. it underwent a lot of rearranging because the open-ended nature of the game made it much more of a puzzle to put together than the majority of the other games on the show, which tend to have very deliberate structures. it was super satisfying & i'm pretty happy with how it ended up, though i think i'm going to take a different approach to this type of game in the future so that i don't end up having to shift chunks around while working to the extent that stuff like this happens, where i accidentally started the third episode with the ending of the second episode,

### data

**stats**

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-character-stats.png" alt="" >}}

not a bad array if we'd been a team tbh. unsurprisingly, we mostly used what we were good at (whether because of our innate abilities or ummm equipment we stole). shout out to speck for never even once attempting to have insight on a situation.

**rolls**

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-2.png" alt="" >}}

at first i was surprised that matt rolled nearly as much as i did bc i love to roll dice, but then realised that he set himself up to roll three times per log & made eleven of them. our ratios are something like 4.75 rolls per log (alyssa), 3.7 rolls per log (matt), & 9.2 rolls per log (satah), despite me making my final entry into two entries because i'm weird about numbers. i love to roll dice!!

here's the breakdown of what those rolls were:

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-3.png" alt="" >}}

"book of fate" is obviously any rolls on the tables in the _book of fate_ pamphlet, "challenge" includes rolling for failure & combat, & "other" is when we just sort of chose to roll dice to figure something out despite it not being in the rules (or, in one case, because of a typo in the rules that the player later noticed & mentioned).

**challenge rolls**

given how hard the mechanics of this game lean towards failure, it's indicative of a lot of resource-spending that we broke almost even on successes & failures

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-4.png" alt="" >}}

we were mostly rolling two or three dice on challenges, which makes sense given stat arrays. i guess it's logical that three dice is about when the success/failure rate starts to get pretty even. shout out to the two rolls with the fewest & most dice both being failures

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-5.png" alt="" >}}

when we did fail, we mostly did... pretty bad! unsurprising that the categories with two rolls were more common, but very funny that the worse one was significantly more frequent, in no small part because of the situations imperius kept finding himself in-- sorry buddy

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-6.png" alt="" >}}

i spent some time calculating which numbers were the most likely to succeed, but it ended up being hampered by the fact that i only have a complete record of the _results_, not the _rolls_. as an example, if you wager 3 and 5, then roll just a 5, that's a success for the 5 but a failure for the 3â€“ but with the data i have, it shows up as a success for both. i didn't make a chart for it because that makes it pretty meaningless (unlike the rest of this data, OF COURSE), but it looks something like this:

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-7.png" alt="" >}}

**book of fate rolls**

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-8.png" alt="" >}}

it did genuinely surprise me that matt rolled in the _book of fate_ more than i did bc, you know. i love to roll dice. in part it's because he fully generated so many NPCs, which takes three or four rolls

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-9.png" alt="" >}}

of alyssa's five _book of fate_ rolls, four were to find a location. three of those gave them the result of "the gardens." that raises its popularity in the locations table, tying it with "drip nightclub"-- the only location all four of us rolled

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-10.png" alt="" >}}

the results from the clans table might be the funniest one to me, because there ARE six possible results. calamity is calamity-focused!! i love that this resulted in double agents & internal conspiracies.

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-11.png" alt="" >}}

the other ones are a bit too piecemeal to justify the space for their charts but here are some tables-- i'm fascinated that we actually rolled every result on the events table & never rolled that there were four of a given threat

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-12.png" alt="" >}}

**wagers**

when you do a challenge roll, you have to call your shot by wagering what number is going to come up on the die. alyssa was the only person to wager every number at least once. i never wagered a two or a four because i don't like them & stuck mostly with my good friends three & five, occasionally dabbling in one & six when it seemed thematically appropriate

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/furyya-chart-13.png" alt="" >}}

you can spend fury to wager two numbers instead-- i don't have a particularly intuitive grasp of math & statistics so it's basically magic to me that it fully flips the likelihood of success

### ok i think that's it

i love this series & i'm so so so glad alyssa & matt played so differently from each other & from me while still making amazing stories because that's what the show is all about babey!!!
