the final episode of [to honour & obey](https://laurieoconnel.itch.io/to-honour-and-obey) went live today ðŸ–¤ i got this game in the [get loud TTRPG bundle](https://itch.io/b/2864/the-get-loud-ttrpg-bundle) earlier this year. glancing at that bundle, i'm seeing both other upcoming games AND upcoming guests so that's very exciting!!

this series took 15.5 hours to edit. the other games i have in the production pipeline right now are pretty freeform & it was way more of a relief than i expected to work on a game that has very defined sections & turns, so now i know that i should try my best to have a balance between those things as much as possible. every game truly truly does still teach me something new about the best way to make this show without burning myself out

## guests

**happy birthday** | gm36.itch.io

## data

while i was working on a proper website for folio so i don't have to keep linking to google docs for transcripts, i realised that my wrap-ups have had a pretty significant scope creep. i love making stupid spreadsheet & charts & stuff but oh my god. getting back to basics for this one

### major arcana

hb & i both consulted the cards for more information a couple of times, so we pulled more major arcana cards in total

we didn't get a full set! also, hb & chloe never pulled the same major arcana card, but i overlapped with bothâ€“ just barely. it's very funny that i pulled every card that chloe did. also, that two count on the worldâ€¦ luckily hb's reactions to their misfortune are so fucking delightful every time

### minor arcana

we squeaked out a full set but even here, there's only one value we all overlap on: the page

speaking of, here's the page of pentacles chloe cracked up about:

### coin flips

mostly heads. i flipped an extra coin to figure out if my husband was nice (heads) or an asshole (tails) & that's the only coin i got a tails on. cute!

## ok i think that's it

i'm so glad my much-more-informed guests were here to round out the gameplay & i'm so glad their presence encouraged me to play this game. it's not a story i ever would have told on my own & i was really happy with it. i cannot BELIEVE that i pulled the sun at the end
