### the guests

**dorian** | support your local library | @michifott \[ [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/michifott.bsky.social) ]

**nick butler&#x20;**| <https://www.tidebreakerrpg.com/> | @fallonmyblade \[ [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fallonmyblade.bsky.social) ]

### process

these episodes took 33 hours to edit. the only series that's taken longer was _live. love. die. remember._ (36 hours) & that was because i made a huge mistake that took four hours to fix. this one was just labour intensive!!

dorian was the one who brought this game to my attention when i was looking for a way to get him on the show & i'm sooo so so glad it all came together. there were a couple different potential second guests, but a series of emergencies & circumstances meant that about a week before the episodes were going to start airing, i was still without a second playthrough. i really prefer the dynamic of three people in total when at all possible, so i put out a call on bluesky & nick appeared in my DMs-- i really appreciate his willingness to hop into the fray at the last minute so i didn't have a gap in episodes ðŸ–¤

### data

we each discovered almost exactly the same amount of information about our planets, but had fairly different ratios of "discoveries on unique cards" to "discoveries made on a repeat visit to a card":

the distributions of trait types were super even across players, as well:

_(the counts are different from the "unique" counts in the first chart because this one doesn't include the four aces!)_

every symbol was drawn at least once! the most common was an arrow & the least common was a rectangle. the only symbols that didn't come up for all four trait types were the symbols that appeared fewer than four times:

i'm so struck by how even this game ended up!! i guess it makes sense with nearly half the deck in each of our maps, but i still usually see a much weirder random skew. the trait scenes were a little more lopsided, but only barely:

dorian had the widest spread of symbols, drawing at least one of every type, while nick's & mine were a bit more clustered. i triple-checked & yeah, each of us drew three arrows!! we are NAVIGATING we are EXPLORING we are POINTING IN DIRECTIONS

### ok i guess that's it

the final thing i want to note is that dorian made my straight-up favourite little creature in folio history in this series (the perfectly cylindrical bugs)!!! âšªâšªâšªâšªâšª
