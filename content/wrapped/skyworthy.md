the final episode of the [skyworthy](https://acoupleofdrakes.itch.io/skyworthyzine) series just went live! i love these episodes so much. caleb & connor both told incredible stories & i'm so grateful for them!!

### guests

**connor c&#x20;**| support your local library & take a little walk

### process

{{< youtube "SHx5eWse43I" >}}

the attached video is absolutely the silliest thing i've done musically so far in the show: turned a little ditty caleb sung while setting up into the music for the series

while editing i realised at a certain point that my current "uniform from a restaurant i used to work at" pajamas were very thematically appropriate & it DID make me laugh out loud

### data

**tags overall**

caleb's ship's journey was the least daunted. mine was the sleekest. connor's was both the most balanced & the most swift

**choosing vs rolling**

as i've mentioned before, i offer guests the first little bit of my playthrough to optionally listen to as they're preparing. i don't want to influence anyone's games too much, but i do want to give people a sense of what i'm looking for when i give them the somewhat odd task of "sit down & play a game out loud by yourself & don't worry too much about pausing to think or taking your sweet time with stuff." it really delighted me when connor called out the fact that i immediately pulled out dice when asked to make a choice & decided to do the same for the most part, providing at least the gesture of balance between caleb & me:

{{< figure src="/images/wrapped/skyworthy-chart-3.png" alt="" >}}

it tickled me that, in all of the wonderful delicious prompt overlap, nothing was ever chosen twice or rolled twice-- anything that appeared more than once appeared exactly twice: once randomly & once on purpose

{{< figure src="/images/wrapped/skyworthy-chart-4.png" alt="" >}}

of the overlaps:

* as said above, all four were chosen by one person & rolled by the other, but also specifically

  * caleb did all of the choosing, unsurprisingly, but i do think it's cool that 66.6% of his choices ended up overlapping with something rolled in that round

  * connor & i split the rolling-- balance!

  * which also means connor & i never shared a prompt-- balance?!!

* all four were repeated in the same era

  * event tables change per era so that isn't a surprise, but the "time passes" tables are consistent across three eras so they COULD have come up at different points of the game

* both double "events" were by caleb & me ("no friends in high places" & "we'll get ourselves a little further")

* both double "time passes" were by caleb & connor ("mind yourself, she's particular" & "painted with care")

**captains**

overall, our captains had a very even spread of tags:

{{< figure src="/images/wrapped/skyworthy-chart-5.png" alt="" >}}

individually, caleb's captains were dauntless but not sleek, while connor's captains were distinctly unpowerful

{{< figure src="/images/wrapped/skyworthy-chart-6.png" alt="" >}}

_both caleb & i pulled double suits once while determining captains, so we both had one more captain card than connor_

**refits**

caleb was absolutely correct that he was the luckiest with getting refits, but i wasn't that far behind-- connor, on the other hand, stayed physically the same almost the entire way through despite the constant changes of name

{{< figure src="/images/wrapped/skyworthy-chart-7.png" alt="" >}}

when looking for a refit, dauntless & powerful tags were the most likely to come up:

{{< figure src="/images/wrapped/skyworthy-chart-8.png" alt="" >}}

i was curious if one particular tag or another was more likely to have ended up in a successful refit. sort of!! 100% of swift refits were successful, but all of the others hover around 50%

{{< figure src="/images/wrapped/skyworthy-chart-9.png" alt="" >}}

**events**

we each pulled three event cards, & despite their narrative power, the tags weren't particularly powerful-heavy

{{< figure src="/images/wrapped/skyworthy-chart-10.png" alt="" >}}

that singular powerful tag was pulled by me:

_sorry the all-blue charts are so hard to read in instances like this-- i'm still figuring out the best way to present data without just defaulting to my personal aesthetic, which eschews colour almost entirely, so it is EXPERIMENTAL_

**time passes**

so ok. imagine this in the cadence of "how does fruit fly" "like a banana": how does time pass? sleekly

**ok i think that's it**

these episodes are really, really dear to me. i'm pretty confident in my abilities as a player & storyteller, which i bring up only to assure you i'm not being self-effacing when i say i think connor & caleb both blew me entirely out of the water (ha ha) with their narrative throughlines & continuities in this series. it made me really happy to get to showcase them like this & i think it made an incredible series. thanks everyone! see you in the sky & all of that!!
