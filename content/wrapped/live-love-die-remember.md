### process & data

**charts**

obviously this isn't a super mechanically intensive game, so there wasn't an enormous amount of Spreadsheet Madness for me to succumb to. BUT. i found a couple of things to make charts about anyway :)

out of a possible 30 memory prompts, we only got 17 in total-- so the podcast only explored a little over half of the narrative possibilities presented by the game, which i think is pretty incredible given how much different ground our stories covered!!

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/live-love-die-remember-chart-1.png" alt="" >}}

most of the memory prompts were only given to one specific player, with the only prompt given to all three of us being "when you made a promise to them"

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/live-love-die-remember-chart-2.png" alt="" >}}

the majority of prompts were found randomly, & unsurprisingly to me, i was not one of the people who diverged from that.

**_note:_**_&#xA0;"reroll" is defined here as rolling again & taking that exact roll-- if there was a reroll then a choice, it was categorised as "choose"_

**valentine's day**

i somehow only realised that one of the episodes of this incredibly romantic tragic lesbian mech series would be releasing ON valentine's day when i was mentioning the schedule so that brianna & dora could provide any time sensitive plugs

_why did i censor the bullet points? it's not a secret. it's literally just like "the exact name & pronouns you want to be credited by & any social media links". i don't know why i'd have to hide that. like oooh no-one can know that i do the bare minimum of being respectful as a podcast host. gotta keep that locked up. in case i want to be sooo mysterious about specifically this_

in honour of the holiday drop, of courseÂ [i had to make some quotentines](https://bsky.app/profile/posatahchips.gaygothvibes.online/post/3li5olxqmgs24)Â with relevant pulls from episode three:

**production**

the playthroughs were recorded in november & december 2024, then started being released in january 2025. 6.3 hours of raw audio turned into 4.15 hours of podcast. i tracked aboutÂ 36 hours of post-production:

* 30Â hours of editing

* 4 hours of fixing a cataclysmic error \*

* 2 hours of "final touches" (editing intros/outros/etc. & making/recording/syncing music)

\[\*] so,

{{< figure src="/img/wrapped/live-love-die-remember-angst-4.png" alt="" >}}

i have a dedicated physical calendar for folio to track deadlines & when i worked on things & whatever & the tiny addition of the sad face marking these events REALLY cracks me up (pencil carefully censoring spoilers for the next series):

It's Fineâ„¢. i have changed my process so that it's less likely to explode on me in this way. also

**ok that's it**

eternally grateful to dora & brianna for their contributions. i'd like to specifically shout out dora's ability to make specific pulls from various mecha animes (as well as real world history!!) & brianna's habit of going into fully voice-acted in-character dialogue. it's hard for me to imagine this specific series with any other guests & i'm so happy this is how the show spent the majority of its february ðŸ¤–ðŸŒˆðŸ’Œ
