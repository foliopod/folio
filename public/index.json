[{"content":"001 - accomplice 01 - with caleb zane huett \u0026 toma | RSS.com INTRO SATAH: Welcome to Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah, and I\u0026rsquo;m showcasing multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together. If that sounds interesting to you, congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve come to the right place. That\u0026rsquo;s what this is.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also episode 1 of our Accomplice game, a roleplaying game about researching the unknown by Michael Klamerus. I\u0026rsquo;m going to quote from the itch page: \u0026ldquo;Since the beginning of time, the forces of evil have sought to cause fear and destruction, and each time it attempts to do so, a hero rises to stop them. You are not one of those heroes.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a hack of Takuma Okada\u0026rsquo;s Alone Among the Stars, inspired by Jane Jensen\u0026rsquo;s point-and-click adventure game series, Gabriel Knight, which I knew nothing about before and have now very fittingly gone down a little bit of a Wikipedia research rabbit hole about.\nBasically, you play a hero\u0026rsquo;s assistant. You\u0026rsquo;re doing the research and the groundwork that will enable someone else to ultimately defeat the evil that you\u0026rsquo;re looking into.\nThe other assistants on this journey with me, my comrades in right hands, my beloved cast of fellow lower billings– in the game only; top billing in my heart– are Caleb Zane Huett and Tomas Gimenez Rioja. I will tell you a little more about them and some of their cool things that they\u0026rsquo;ve got going on at the break.\nI chose to feature Accomplice because I\u0026rsquo;m very drawn to games that make it very explicit that you aren\u0026rsquo;t the main character of the world. It\u0026rsquo;s a really fun inversion of your classic heroic tabletop archetypes, and I think that even if you prefer playing the protagonist in your games, games like this encourage you to imagine that the world exists beyond your character, which makes it feel more full.\nThere are four sections to Accomplice. The setup, the research, the plan, and the ending. Because we\u0026rsquo;re a bunch of smarties here, or at least playing smarties, we\u0026rsquo;re going to start logically at the beginning with the setup.\nIn the setup, you pull a card to determine your foe, then answer some establishing questions about the world and your characters. So let\u0026rsquo;s go meet our villains, heroes, and sidekicks.\nGAME: SET-UP CALEB: I\u0026rsquo;m here playing Accomplice.\nTOMAS: Today we will be playing the game of Accomplice.\nSATAH: Open my little, uh… Star Wars Rebels card pack.\nCALEB: I have a deck of cards I got from Video Games New York, a used game store in New York City that I love, that is a Kirby-themed trading card game deck. So I\u0026rsquo;ve got a bunch of King Dededes in here, some Waddle Dees, Kirby in various powers and forms, some Meta Knights, etcetera.\nTOMAS: I have my notebook at hand, and let me get a D6 quite quick.\n[Sound of a card being dealt]\nSATAH: The suggested supernatural adversary for Queen is extraterrestrial, and I love space! So this is great.\nTOMAS: Uh, Jack of Hearts. A Jack means that I will be fighting a doppelganger. This will be a very interesting adventure.\nCALEB: I just actually, before turning on my microphone, pulled a card for my enemy, what me and my heroic partner will be facing off against. This time I got a King, which is an android, which is great. I say this time because I actually tried to record this once, and I started off one with a mummy. I made it pretty far with a mummy, and I like Yu-Gi-Oh as much as the next guy, but I realized I only have so much tolerance for pretending I know the culture around mummies? They feel, like, very historical and real in a way that it felt silly to play around with. So I didn\u0026rsquo;t love where that was going, and I started over with a new one, and this time I got android, which I love.\nSATAH: Before you begin your research, answer the following questions. \u0026ldquo;Where are you located in the world?\u0026rdquo; Something that\u0026rsquo;s interesting to me here, when we\u0026rsquo;re playing in the realm of aliens, extraterrestrials, \u0026ldquo;in the world\u0026rdquo; carries a lot more weight than it might otherwise? I think it automatically sets up more of a feeling of incursion, of invasion. Because to me, if I\u0026rsquo;m really respecting the implications of that question, I have to be on Earth; I can\u0026rsquo;t be like in a space station or whatever. Obviously it would be totally fine to massage it in that way, but that\u0026rsquo;s just like, that\u0026rsquo;s sort of just the box that I feel is being set up for me to play in? And I like that. I think that\u0026rsquo;s interesting. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with that.\nMedium picture? Somewhere in Canada, because that\u0026rsquo;s my point of reference…\nCALEB: We\u0026rsquo;re dealing with an android. It\u0026rsquo;s me and a hero. Because it\u0026rsquo;s what I know best, I think we\u0026rsquo;re going to stick to America in this case. Somewhere in America. I\u0026rsquo;ll do it close to home. I\u0026rsquo;m in the American South; I\u0026rsquo;m near Atlanta.\nTOMAS: I want to be located in, like… why not be located in my country? I am in Argentina. So I will be playing from there. On the city of Buenos Aires, why not? And this doppelganger is located within the biggest city, one of the biggest cities in the world, by the way. And this will happen upon this very age, so information can spread quickly and easily. It can be very hard to find a doppelganger among the crew, among the people… and you can trust no one.\nSATAH: A lot of alien stories are very rural? You know, your sort of like, grav kidnapped cows and crop circles, etcetera? And I think I want to hit a midpoint between sort of your big urban city center and the like, extreme rural thing? Like I have this image of, um, crop circles on lawns, you know? Rather than like a big field, just little crop circles being done on people\u0026rsquo;s lawns. So maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a suburb, actually. I think, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s really fun to me. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be like a suburb, a cul-de-sac kind of thing. And so there have been these like crop circles appearing on people\u0026rsquo;s perfect, like, manicured lawns and whatever.\nTOMAS: \u0026ldquo;How did your partner hear about this creature?\u0026rdquo; I know that person that is trying to locate this is someone that is an investigator of the occult. This investigator is going to be named, and I\u0026rsquo;ll start writing this, um… Jorge Pugnales. That\u0026rsquo;s the name of the investigator of the occult.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;How did your partner hear about this creature?\u0026rdquo; One thing I really like here, uh, immediately saying like, \u0026ldquo;how did your partner hear about this creature?\u0026rdquo;, not \u0026ldquo;how did you and your partner hear about this creature?\u0026rdquo; Really immediately making that dynamic obvious.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m going to say, obviously, the crop circles on otherwise perfectly manicured lawns. What are other alien tropes? I really do not want to play in animal death here, um. But alien stories so often interact with animals, like, you know, aforementioned cow, uh… scooping.\n[Laughing]\nWhat if it\u0026rsquo;s also just tiny crop circles in pets\u0026rsquo; fur? Someone just thinks that this is like a prank, that one of the rowdy teens is shaving patterns into everybody\u0026rsquo;s lawns and pets. And so what was the thing that made it obviously alien?\nOh my god. Okay, so I think… the thing I\u0026rsquo;m drawing on here is Invader Zim, of all things. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure it\u0026rsquo;s in Invader Zim that like, at one point they just create a house, right? Or something like that?\nSo I think it\u0026rsquo;s the hero sees through some sort of classic reality distortion field. You know, it\u0026rsquo;s like, everyone\u0026rsquo;s like, pretending that Miss Gleebglorb has always been at the barbecues and those three houses have always been row home– a row home, and the hero was, I mean, if it\u0026rsquo;s if it\u0026rsquo;s a suburban area, then I feel like we\u0026rsquo;re playing in coming of age stuff. So it could be something as like, the hero was off at college when this happened, and has like come back for the summer or whatever, and is like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, why does everybody think that we\u0026rsquo;ve always had a neighbor Miss Gleebglorb?\u0026rdquo; Um, yeah, absolutely.\nCALEB: Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go high concept with this one. I think the hero, this particular hero in our story is someone who\u0026rsquo;s from the future. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m not from the future, but the hero is from the future. And they are aware of a fate. A future fate where all these bad things happen. And we\u0026rsquo;re doing a kind of like, Monster of the Week style story… and life, for us, not a story, real life, where we are dealing with a bunch of different problems that might cause this like, horrible apocalyptic future? We know that there\u0026rsquo;s some combination of these that can lead to like the terrible future that the hero came back from. That he returned from. And every once in a while, we catch wind of something strange happening that might lead there based on a series of historical clues he brought with him.\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to think– maybe he has like an interesting data pad or something, something that mentions when something terrible might happen historically? That\u0026rsquo;s kind of fun, if we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with sci-fi.\nSo maybe we heard about it… maybe on a… maybe at a convention. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;re on day one of DragonCon, which just happened, like last weekend. We were on day one of DragonCon in Atlanta, and there was this big, wild viral video of this person doing these crazy things that it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible for a person to do. And everybody was thinking it was like a really complicated and interesting cosplay, but the video made it to us, and we know that historically there\u0026rsquo;s a scary android– historically meaning from the future– there\u0026rsquo;s a scary android that starts wreaking havoc on the world around this time, and so the hero is pretty sure that this android– that this person at this con was a real android. It\u0026rsquo;s a very silly setup, but let\u0026rsquo;s go with that. And I like the time pressure. We\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a convention we know they\u0026rsquo;re at. We\u0026rsquo;re on day one, and I\u0026rsquo;m in Atlanta with, you know, full mobility.\nSATAH: For \u0026ldquo;How did you partner hear about this creature?\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m also just going to put uh \u0026ldquo;saw through the reality distortion field because they were away at college when it was applied.\u0026rdquo; Which also honestly leads really naturally into the next question of, \u0026ldquo;Did they choose to confront this foe or were they forced to?\u0026rdquo;\nThey chose it. They had to have, because they were one of the ones who could see through it. But I think that it\u0026rsquo;s probably a combination in that they– they tried to just have a conversation. Like they were like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s happening here, and I\u0026rsquo;m a little suspicious just because… if you had good intentions, I feel like you would have just moved in rather than pretending you\u0026rsquo;ve always lived here? But you know, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just missing something,\u0026rdquo; and so they went to try and like just have a conversation and then, you know, they unveiled whatever evil plan, uh, we\u0026rsquo;ll define further.\nAnd so they chose to speak to the foe, but the confrontation, like the actual like fight, was forced by the aliens.\n**TOMAS: \u0026ldquo;**Did they choose to confront this foe or were they forced to?\u0026rdquo; I like to think that there is a rivalry within these two individuals. So Jorge Pugnales, um… his wife was assassinated by this doppelganger. This being took the form of his wife. His wife is going to be named, uh… Rosa. Rosa Martínez. Why not?\nSo we have Jorge Pugnales and Rosa Martínez. Rosa was assassinated; now Jorge is after this being. And I am his partner.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Did they choose to confront this foe or were they forced to?\u0026rdquo; I think… I think this was a choice. I think they made a heroic choice to return to the past to try to fix things that they see as creating a domino effect to a post-apocalyptic terrible future, um, where potentially robots rule the world, or any number of other bad things happened. And I think they\u0026rsquo;re traveling far enough back in the past that– and they\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a post-apocalyptic future where information is very controlled, so they don\u0026rsquo;t have a perfect idea of what happens, but they have a pretty good idea that someone needed to be focused on being a hero during this time.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Is your partner good at this?\u0026rdquo; What a great question. Yeah. Yeah, I think they are, but also maybe they\u0026rsquo;re a little rusty.\nI feel like the story I\u0026rsquo;m building is, is sort of like, you know, Veronica Mars Season 4 or whatever– whatever season it was that was Kickstarted years after the show was originally finished, or your Party Down sequel series and that kind of thing. Like, the idea that um, this was a show, sort of a 90s, early 2000s era where it was like, teen supernatural fighters, and then it ended with them going off to college? You know, the whole team split up, and now 15 years later, they\u0026rsquo;re like… we could just make another season.\n[Laughing]\nUm, and I\u0026rsquo;ll have to figure out my relationship to that. I immediately have the feeling that I maybe stayed in town? But yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say, yes, but they\u0026rsquo;re rusty because they moved to, in Buffy terms, a place that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have– that isn\u0026rsquo;t on a Hellmouth.\nTOMAS: \u0026ldquo;Is your partner good at this?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to say that Jorge is the sort of person that the rich people among the city and the country contact when something of the occult is going on. His contact gets thrown around a lot here in the country. And… I will say he\u0026rsquo;s particularly great at this.\nCALEB: Is my partner good at this? I like the idea that they are spunky, they are energetic, they\u0026rsquo;re athletic, um… and they have a strong energy, which is why they threw themselves back into the past, but that they don\u0026rsquo;t have like a super impressive, clear skill set in this regard. They have a lot of energy, they have a lot of heroism, and… uh… and I think probably I\u0026rsquo;m in love with them.\n[Laughing]\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s going to get to my relationship with my partner, but we\u0026rsquo;ll get there. That\u0026rsquo;s just classic dynamic, right? I\u0026rsquo;m the nerd with the computer, they\u0026rsquo;re the jock saving the day, and I\u0026rsquo;m in gay love with them.\nSo that actually that answers the next question, \u0026ldquo;Why are you helping them?\u0026rdquo; Well, two reasons. One is I was the very first person in the pilot of this show that they saved from some kind of alien that was going to kill me. They saved me. The alien had like, uh, if you want to add romantic drama, the alien had like infected or done something like Yeerk style to my ex boyfriend, and now after they saved me, I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Wait, I\u0026rsquo;m in love with you actually! That relationship was going to end even before he got possessed by an alien earworm that you stopped because otherwise alien earworms would be a major problem in the future.\u0026rdquo; And so I decided to help them because that whole thing meant I believed them very early, and because I have a skill set for taking the bits of information they have and turning them into actionable paths.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Why are you helping them?\u0026rdquo; Ooh. I mean, first of all, it\u0026rsquo;s just what I\u0026rsquo;ve always done. This was our life. This was our entire life when we were kids. And when we were teens, like when we were younger, this is what we did. We were a supernatural investigation crew.\nBut I think more than that, because of what I\u0026rsquo;ve been setting up with like the hero having gone away and now come back, I\u0026rsquo;m also helping them like… to grasp that thing? You know, in it in, in an, like, like, \u0026ldquo;oh, wow, the good old days\u0026rdquo;, but also I think to prove myself a little. Like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, sure, I mean, I stayed in our hometown, but I\u0026rsquo;ve built a whole life for myself.\u0026rdquo; That kind of thing.\nI am genuinely happy to help, and also, I really do want them to respect me.\nTOMAS: Now, \u0026ldquo;why are you helping them?\u0026rdquo; Um, let\u0026rsquo;s see. I am helping Jorge because his last partner died on the job and… I was a good friend of his past partner. I have good qualities at this. I am a great investigator. I used to be someone who worked at a library. I am great at rummaging through documents and finding any sort of information that may be of use to Jorge.\nSATAH: The next question is, \u0026ldquo;Do you have a day job?\u0026rdquo; Absolutely I do. What is it? How on the nose do I want this to be? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make this character seem too… pathetic, like I really, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do the like, you stayed in your hometown and were stunted thing. Like I do want this person to have a life that is like special and worth living and wonderful. So I don\u0026rsquo;t want to just stick them in a job that they hate.\nI do want it to be a job that gives them access… I\u0026rsquo;m just glancing down at the card suite answers in research, which indicate like uh, where you found the thing that you\u0026rsquo;re researching. I\u0026rsquo;m just glancing through that to see if that sort of sparks anything… museums, libraries and buildings devoted to research. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want to go the full librarian route… museum is interesting.\nYeah. Okay. So I think that what I do, my day job is like– I want to be a curator. Not at a museum specifically. I think maybe, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s an art gallery. You know, maybe this is a small town that just has a cool flavorful art scene and I work at this gallery, basically just being like trying to, trying to make the place that I live cool, you know? Um, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun because like, the idea that part of the reason this character knows things about the town\u0026rsquo;s history is because they\u0026rsquo;ve researched art that was created there is very appealing to me.\nSo I think, yeah, just, curator at a small art gallery.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think my character lives in the suburbs anymore. I think, I think they still live in that town, but they\u0026rsquo;ve, they\u0026rsquo;ve moved, you know, further in? But they have family and friends still in this suburb. So they\u0026rsquo;re there pretty frequently. And I think in sort of like the, the logistics of the world, part of what that does is make them affected by this reality distortion field, but less strongly? You know, it\u0026rsquo;s easier for the hero to break it when they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, Ms. Gleebglorb\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep that name. I hope I don\u0026rsquo;t and I hope I do. It\u0026rsquo;s complicated.\nLike, \u0026ldquo;Hey, you, you know, you know, we haven\u0026rsquo;t known Ms. Gleebglorb our whole lives, right?\u0026rdquo; And my character has like a, \u0026ldquo;What? No, of course we have. Don\u0026rsquo;t you remember when she heroically saved my life? Like she dove in front of a car when I was playing on the road?\u0026rdquo; Um, and the hero kind of like stares at me and is like, \u0026ldquo;Why would you have been playing on the road? Like you were super paranoid. You barely left the house. We always just hung out in your basement and your backyard in the tree house. Like, like, why would you have been playing in the road?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd my character sort of like stutters and then is like, \u0026ldquo;Wait… yeah. I, I remember playing hockey, like street hockey and having to be rescued. But I never touched a hockey stick in my life; that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense.\u0026rdquo; And kind of has the illusion shattered.\nOkay, I got a little off track here, but just trying to flesh some stuff out. So, on track and off track. Multitudes.\nTOMAS: \u0026ldquo;Do you have a day job?\u0026rdquo; As I said, I am a librarian as part of my day job. Now should I be still working as that? I will say that I do. Maybe on\u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t work full time anymore because Jorge being that well known, he gets a very great pay grade and I receive part of that payment. Jorge is very good at what he does and he pays well.\nCALEB: Do I have a day job? Yes. Yes. I have a day job and it is… what is an interesting day job for me to have? I like the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s something so of the time. Like, this hero would have no idea what I\u0026rsquo;m getting up to because it has completely disappeared in the future. So what is something that\u0026rsquo;s like super of the now? I\u0026rsquo;m like a… food… blogger. So I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much of a day job this sounds; I\u0026rsquo;m literally just saying words, but I\u0026rsquo;m like, I\u0026rsquo;m like a food blogger, like a food reviewer. I\u0026rsquo;m like a unknown writer about recipes and food, which serves me very little when dealing with an android, but you know, it means I\u0026rsquo;m a great cook! And this hero who\u0026rsquo;s coming from a post-apocalyptic future where they\u0026rsquo;re eating… um, cockroach bars or whatever, is loving the fact that I have such a wide knowledge and skill set when it comes to food. They love the present.\nSATAH: And the last question in the setup is, \u0026ldquo;What is your relationship with your partner?\u0026rdquo; Well this is great. Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely like gone over a lot of this, but like, childhood friend, probably still close enough that like we would invite each other to each other\u0026rsquo;s weddings, you know… we DM memes to each other and catch up on video calls… and like I would stay at their house, you know, if I were, if I were visiting the big city and that kind of thing.\nBut there is a distance there. And I think, I think that it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of distance that can be… overcome? Like, you know, we need to grow apart in these, in these times while we\u0026rsquo;re both like in our early 20s. You\u0026rsquo;re at college, I happened into this job a little younger than you would expect because the last curator was, you know, 160 years old, and as soon as she saw that I like knew what a painting was, she was like, \u0026ldquo;Do you want to take over my business? So that it can live on?\u0026rdquo;\nSo yeah, childhood friend a little distant now, but still close, testing our boundaries as we grow up separately, but ultimately probably come back together.\nCALEB: What is my relationship with my partner? Unrequited love, I think. I think they\u0026rsquo;re so focused on saving the day that they\u0026rsquo;re not thinking about romance, but they\u0026rsquo;re doing that thing that people in stories like this and with energies like this do where they\u0026rsquo;re like treating me so much like a boyfriend ultimately that I get to feel like that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s happening? Even when, uh, to them, they\u0026rsquo;re just kind of existing. Big energy, moving from place to place, leaning on everybody because it\u0026rsquo;s the only way they can then save the day in the end. Uh, and so I have a mixed, complicated feelings about that. And I just wish we could have a sincere conversation one day about our feelings.\n[Laughing]\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s, I think my relationship with my partner in this.\nTOMAS: I have a good relationship with Jorge, but because I want to put a bit more juice within all this, I will say that even though I have a great relationship with Jorge, I am worried from him. I know that Jorge has a terminal illness and should not be spending his time doing what he does. He should be with his family and because he has two children.\nYeah, my relationship is a good one. I will not say it\u0026rsquo;s a great one. I may have to withstand his bad temper from time to time. So I may get the short end of the stick at moments when he\u0026rsquo;s pretty nervous.\nSATAH: Great! That\u0026rsquo;s the setup.\nCALEB: So that is my setup. Thank you so much for listening. Is that what I should say? I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m really happy with how that developed. Those are really cool questions that– it\u0026rsquo;s always satisfying– it\u0026rsquo;s equally satisfying in different ways when you\u0026rsquo;re doing character or world creation when the next question leads so perfectly from the last one, like when you\u0026rsquo;re like, wait, I was just talking about that. And also when the next question is a huge surprise, like you\u0026rsquo;re like, wait, I was just at a totally different mode. I think both of those things are so cool. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s a really fun balance of those two different things in here.\nTOMAS: Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll say that is the end of the setup.\nCALEB: [Laughing] I know you can do a sidekick and not have romance involved, but I\u0026rsquo;m here playing a solo game, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to have some gay romance. I\u0026rsquo;m going to sip my Topo Chico, speaking of homosexual.\nBREAK SATAH: Thank you very much, Caleb, for the unwittingly perfect segue.\n[Reverb-y can opening sound]\n… My roommate and I bought like a water carbonator, so I don\u0026rsquo;t really do cans anymore, but I thought that sound is better than the carbonator sound because how would you even know what that is unless you have one? I also think Topo Chico only comes in bottles. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I don\u0026rsquo;t think you can actually get it in Canada. I tried it for the first time when I was in the States a little while ago. Uhhh… foley! Is hard!\nBefore we get into the research phase, I want to let you know a little bit more about cool shit that my guests are doing.\nCaleb, whose work you can find at CalebZaneHuett.com is the lead designer on Triangle Agency, a roleplaying game of paranormal investigation and corporate horror, which is getting a physical edition! It is printing now or shortly. Triangle Agency is a fucking blast. I\u0026rsquo;ve rarely been so engrossed by a rulebook as a standalone item, like just as a thing to read and look through, and my love for it really only grew when I had the absolute honour of Caleb GMing it for the whole polycule a few months back. Order a copy at the links in the episode description. It is beyond worth it. Please give it a look.\nTomas, who you can find at TGimenezRGM on Twitter, Bluesky, and Instagram, is releasing Magnolia: the City of Marvels, which is a systemless setting of art, punk, and rebellion. This is a fantastic resource for GMs. I had so much fun even just scrolling the promotional site for it. It\u0026rsquo;s got factions, NPCs, items, and full-fledged, completely system-agnostic campaigns. They\u0026rsquo;re built to be run in whatever game you\u0026rsquo;re playing. It\u0026rsquo;s got story hooks, it\u0026rsquo;s got colour coding, it\u0026rsquo;s got so much style, and in the episode description, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a link to put yourself on the mailing list to hear when the Kickstarter goes live. Please do that. Please tune in to what Tomas is up to. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really exciting. I am– I\u0026rsquo;m really happy to have these two on my first episodes. I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna get weird about it. I\u0026rsquo;m normal about it. It\u0026rsquo;s just cool. I\u0026rsquo;m excited. I\u0026rsquo;m glad you\u0026rsquo;re here.\nBecause as for me, you\u0026rsquo;re already listening to the main thing that I\u0026rsquo;m excited about doing right now! Thank you for doing that! So let\u0026rsquo;s get back into it.\nIn Accomplice, after the setup, we go into the research phase. The rules text I found a little open to interpretation in parts, but we settled on this loop: pull a card to define a source of information and where you found it, then pull 1d6 cards, each of which will prompt a specific piece of information you get from that source. Keep doing that until you have enough information to defeat the foe. For our purposes, I asked everyone to keep it pretty tight at like 3-5 rounds of research, and we are going to wrap up this episode with the first round.\nGAME: RESEARCH ROUND ONE SATAH: Alright.\nTOMAS: Alright.\nCALEB: Alright! Now we are moving into research round one.\nTOMAS: Day one of the investigation of the doppelganger.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s get started with the research. First we\u0026rsquo;re going to pull a research card.\n[Sound of a card being pulled]\nThe King of Diamonds. Yeah, so King is \u0026ldquo;evidence left behind by opponent\u0026rdquo;, and diamonds are \u0026ldquo;sources from the internet, such as websites, forums, and social media.\u0026rdquo; Great. I mean that\u0026rsquo;s already very exciting. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a d6.\n[Die clattering]\nThree. So that means I\u0026rsquo;m going to pull three cards. I haven\u0026rsquo;t left myself any space on my desk to put things… here we go.\n[Three cards being pulled]\nOkay so I pulled a 2, a 6, and an 8. \u0026ldquo;Previous sightings of foe or one of their ancestors\u0026rdquo;,\n\u0026ldquo;clues about why they\u0026rsquo;re behaving the way they are\u0026rdquo;, and 8 is \u0026ldquo;facts about the identity of the enemy, such as their appearance and name.\u0026rdquo; Cool.\nSo, previous sightings of the foe or one of their ancestors. I immediately– again more pop culture references– think of the sequence in Doctor Who. I believe it is in Eccleston\u0026rsquo;s season where there is a montage of… Christopher Eccleston\u0026rsquo;s face photoshopped into pictures… in a way that was befitting of the technology at the time. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want to go with that exactly, but let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nSo this is evidence left behind by the opponent on the internet. One of the first things I thought of when I saw that the source would be the internet was the idea that this alien has to create social media in order to fit in. You know? Like the other suburban moms were like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, let me add you on Facebook, I can put you in the cul-de-sac chat.\u0026rdquo; and this alien had to be like, \u0026ldquo;Mmm… book of faces!\u0026rdquo; Classic alien shit, you know? And I like the idea that it was pulled together so fumblingly and like quickly like, \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah of course! I\u0026rsquo;ll add you, I\u0026rsquo;ll add you when I get home. Uh, excuses excuses,\u0026rdquo; and they ran home and had to create a Facebook account for their new human identity. And they had to put a bunch of images in there…\nOh my god, yeah okay, so it\u0026rsquo;s like, it\u0026rsquo;s a Mother\u0026rsquo;s Day post. Like… this alien just sort of follows the trends that they see all the other, uh, they see the human moms do to try and keep fitting in. And on Mother\u0026rsquo;s Day they saw everybody posting these like, rhapsodising things with a picture of their mom when she was younger. And so the alien was like, \u0026ldquo;Well! Gotta have a mom. Gotta have a mom who I love and a picture of them when they were younger.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd you know, we would see… in the show that is closer to about like, the alien\u0026rsquo;s journey, um, we would see them like, doing research on what a mom is and being like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s sort of like… the… Creche Warden. Sure. Well, in my cool alien culture, we always do the same job– or, it\u0026rsquo;s the highest honour to do the same job as your Creche Warden, that they were sort of like, preparing you for your entire… hatching… and life and whatever.\u0026rdquo; Um, so, just being like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, sure, yeah, my quote unquote mother also integrated themself into Earth. Yeah, I can post a picture of that person.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think, I mean, I think it just has to be like a… sort of one of those just moments of hero intuition, I think, where it\u0026rsquo;s like scrolling Ms. Gleebglorb\u0026rsquo;s Facebook page and being like, \u0026ldquo;Wait, who is this woman? Like, the style of her clothes looks a little odd. Like this is– this is supposed to be this person\u0026rsquo;s mother? But the ages don\u0026rsquo;t seem to line up, based on, you know, the era that this photo was taken in. Let\u0026rsquo;s look further into that.\u0026rdquo;\nTrying to decide if I want to define what that establishes… I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Because I don\u0026rsquo;t think that we need to have all the answers yet, so I think it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of the thing where it\u0026rsquo;s like, we now know, or at least think we know what\u0026rsquo;s happened before. Because we like research this person that was in the Mother\u0026rsquo;s Day post. And we\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, this person also showed up in a community… like they only start being referenced in newspapers or whatever of this date, but they\u0026rsquo;re being referenced as though they\u0026rsquo;ve been there for a very long time. So we know like, this has happened before!\nIt probably isn\u0026rsquo;t clear to us if it\u0026rsquo;s the same person or another person.\nNext one is \u0026ldquo;clues about why they\u0026rsquo;re behaving the way they are.\u0026rdquo; Ooh… oh, I mean, again, on their Facebook page, they\u0026rsquo;re like campaigning for something. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably… the thing I\u0026rsquo;m most drawn to is that they are campaigning to be like, on a school council of some kind, you know, or like head of the PTA. Like they are making a power grab and it isn\u0026rsquo;t totally clear yet what that\u0026rsquo;s leading to. But it seems like they have integrated themself into this community in order to get elected to the head of the PTA. And then… question mark.\n\u0026ldquo;Facts about the identity of the enemy such as their appearance and name.\u0026rdquo; Yeah, this is interesting because I had just… maybe I\u0026rsquo;d– maybe I\u0026rsquo;d put us a little bit forward, like more forward in the narrative. Like we know what they look like. Oh, I guess that we don\u0026rsquo;t know maybe what they really look like. Name could also… maybe exploring their name… I might massage this a little bit to not necessarily be like the alien\u0026rsquo;s name specifically, but like, the name of the planet they\u0026rsquo;re from… or their ship or something…\nI think up until this point, we didn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know that this person was an alien. Like we\u0026rsquo;re like, so some sort of supernatural being has moved into the suburb where we grew up and has convinced everyone else, including our families, presumably, that they\u0026rsquo;ve always been there. But there are a lot of supernatural beings that could do that. Like remember in season one, episode 14? When that basically happened here? Or remember the monsters that we defeated in the like… remember the big bad… of season six? It could be any of those things.\nAnd so what I want to find out here, now knowing that like, this is something that has happened before, now knowing that they\u0026rsquo;re campaign– campaigning for power in some way, this is where I want to find out that this is an alien.\nOh, and– okay– so it\u0026rsquo;s their cover photo. It\u0026rsquo;s their cover photo on Facebook and it is a galaxy and there\u0026rsquo;s a comment underneath that\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Wow, Brenda, beautiful photo. Why did you choose it?\u0026rdquo; And then Brenda– which is Mrs. Brenda Gleebglorb– um– comments like \u0026ldquo;reminds me of home\u0026rdquo;, smiley face. And then the person who first commented responded like, \u0026ldquo;Ahh, yeah, the views of our childhood are so important. I\u0026rsquo;ll always remember the sunsets off of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\u0026rdquo;\nUm, So Brenda, Brenda, Brenda Gleebglorb\u0026rsquo;s– fuck. Brenda, Brenda Gleebglorb\u0026rsquo;s cover photo on Facebook is a night sky, a galaxy. And and they are letting everybody assume that this is just like what the night sky looked like when they were a child. Like this is the view from their backyard, their childhood home, you know. If you asked further, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that they\u0026rsquo;ve had conversations about this, that like they could lay out on the… in the backyard of their childhood home, away from the big city where you can actually see the stars, and just stare up into the night sky. And that\u0026rsquo;s when, you know, she knew that she wanted to… work in… accounts receiving at Enterprise Bank Chain Number 46 or whatever. Um.\n[Laughing]\nBut actually what it is– ACTUALLY what it is, is a photo of where her home planet is. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s like a thing where it\u0026rsquo;s like, we\u0026rsquo;re like looking at this galaxy photo, like stumped, you know, we\u0026rsquo;ve scrolled up and down this Facebook timeline. We\u0026rsquo;re back up at the top, just staring at the picture of this person. And then because, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m the smarty, it has to catch my eye.\nI\u0026rsquo;m like looking at this galaxy photo and I lean in and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;That can\u0026rsquo;t be taken from Earth.\u0026rdquo; And I like, you know, gesture to like point out some like– star bodies, whatever, planets, something– the kind of thing that like could easily be unnoticed, like you just kind of assume, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, stars look different sometimes in different places. I didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up in the middle of nowhere. I grew up in the big cities or the suburb and I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a star.\nBut I recognize like, wait, there\u0026rsquo;s no way that this could be taken from Earth because we don\u0026rsquo;t have any of these bodies. And, you know, call in one of our other friends? We like, we Zoom, you know, we do like a video call from one of our friends who had some sort of life changing experience and went off to study astronomy at university. And we\u0026rsquo;re like, hey, this is your cameo for this season because you were too booked up to come back for the sequel. Uh, but we– the fans love your character and we want to know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, so so you\u0026rsquo;re going to cameo in this episode, but just over video call because we couldn\u0026rsquo;t get you to the studio.\n[Laughing]\nAnd we call her and she\u0026rsquo;s like, bleep bloop bleep bleep bloop. And is like, \u0026ldquo;Well, this has to be from this galaxy.\u0026rdquo; And you know, we find out, you know… there\u0026rsquo;s there\u0026rsquo;s there\u0026rsquo;s cross referencing. There\u0026rsquo;s always cross referencing. She like sends us a bunch of documents and I\u0026rsquo;m I\u0026rsquo;m looking like combing through them and being like, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s only one planet that could theoretically sustain life here:\n[Struggling to think noises]\nUhhh, planet name. I just want to say Gleepglorp again. Just going to real quick\u0026ndash;\n[Typing noises]\nPlanet name generator.\nThank you, fantasy name generators dot com for holding up the tabletop hobby on your beautiful broad shoulders.\nThoth. Thoth C 94. Crabsolutely. So we\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Well, that must be where they\u0026rsquo;re from.\u0026rdquo; We find the name of their planet.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m just going to write down a couple of notes.\n[Unintelligible \u0026ldquo;reading the question out loud very fast\u0026rdquo; noises]\nWe call our friend who is studying astrology, who helps us figure out Thoth, Thoth C 94. Great.\nTOMAS: We will first start our investigation in the…\n[Card being pulled]\nNine of Clubs. This is \u0026ldquo;a location in your area like landmarks, crime scene and other places of interest\u0026rdquo;. We\u0026rsquo;re going to start at the crime scene of the last crime. This being a nine means that we are going to find a photo of the crime scene.\nNow we roll a D6 in order to see how many pieces of evidence we can find within this place.\n[Die clatter]\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a four. This means that we are going to be taking…\n[Four cards being pulled]\nThese four cards.\nWe will start with the Q, which means that there is a possible location of the rival located within the photo. When we got this photo from one of the key investigators of the crime… General Rodriguez, from… the police. The photo showed this sort of note handed by the doppelganger on the crime scene. It stated that, um, he could find him at the planetarium.\nAnother one is a Q again, which means another possible location of the rival. We will see within the photo there is a map hanging on the backside of the bed. This map of the city has many pins within it. Maybe some sort of message that the doppelganger wants to help us know. Jorge Pugnales told me that these locations may be possible places where crimes have occurred already or where he could appear in the future. These indicate one of the cemeteries– of Recoleta, one of the famous places here in the city of Buenos Aires. We don\u0026rsquo;t know what may happen in there.\nAnother Q is the next card, so three Qs in a row. Again, a possible location of the rival. This being the pink house, the government institution place. Similar to the white house from the US, we here in Argentina have the pink house, in which the president usually lays. Maybe he is trying to do something with the president.\nLastly, the last of the details that we can find within the photo is a card who\u0026rsquo;s named number 7, \u0026ldquo;info about an incident caused by them or sighting\u0026rdquo;. By investigating this map, Jorge could identify that one of these places, one of these locations was where some horse races are held, here in San Ysidro. This is where many of the people with high fortunes go and bet on horses. A crime was held recently in there. This murder that occurred was dismissed by the police, saying that one of the people in there just suffered a heart attack. There was no evidence that stated this, but for some reason the police decided to hide this fact. Maybe the police have some sort of connection with the doppelganger. Maybe he has infiltrated in the past or changed some aspects within it.\nCALEB: Ooh baby, D6 acquired. My piece of information for you, grounding us in space, is that I\u0026rsquo;m recording this in a bathroom to avoid echo in my office, which has tall ceilings. So here in the bathroom I\u0026rsquo;m sitting on the floor and imagining myself in the great city of Atlanta during the peak of its largest…\n[Laughing]\nIts largest nerd convention, DragonCon, which I personally have visited seven times, probably– seven or eight, but haven\u0026rsquo;t been since around 2017, 2016 maybe. It\u0026rsquo;s been a long time.\n[Hums a little tune]\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pull a card for research round one. What\u0026rsquo;s going on with this android and what are they doing at Dragon Con?\nI got a jack of hearts. Hearts are \u0026ldquo;personal library, artefacts gathered from previous cases\u0026rdquo;, and jack is \u0026ldquo;journal\u0026rdquo;. Okay! This actually makes a lot of sense. So, I am looking at the datapad that I received from my hero when he came– which, oh, we need a name. I hate to make names.\nThe hero\u0026rsquo;s name, what\u0026rsquo;s like a future name? Hero\u0026rsquo;s name is, um, it\u0026rsquo;s Zill. Like Dill, like the pickles, but with a Z. Um, actually let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s Z-Y-L-L. Got Zyll. This hero\u0026rsquo;s name is Zyll. And my name is Charlie. Charlie. I have a bad habit of picking fake names that match the first letter of my real name. And that\u0026rsquo;s… this one, I feel like this game is inviting me to be me, really, if we\u0026rsquo;re being mundane people saving the day with a hero, so I don\u0026rsquo;t mind it not being too far away.\nZyll and Charlie. So Zyll brought with him this datapad of historical record from the future that is accumulated by– that has been like curated and created by people over time despite the futuristic awful world\u0026rsquo;s control of information, their attempts to hide the truth from the people out there, and to make the average human kind of subservient to the whims of these great evil forces that have taken over in the time since the present. So I have this datapad and I\u0026rsquo;m able to check it for information on these things that will become a problem in the future, but this information is not always reliable, it\u0026rsquo;s not always directly true, and it is incomplete. So it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always tell me like an exact fact about the future, it just lets me know kind of what I\u0026rsquo;m dealing with– when I can find someone or a particular subject inside of it. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re looking at.\nThis old… this old future journal in the form of like a datapad and I\u0026rsquo;m rolling a die to see how much research we get out of it. How useful is this datapad?\n[Die clatter]\nWhoa, a six! We\u0026rsquo;re starting off strong with an extreme amount of information on this particular guy, which makes me think this android is a big deal in the future we\u0026rsquo;re attempting to prevent. Um, so let\u0026rsquo;s see how much information we\u0026rsquo;re able to get from it. Six pieces, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw six cards and move through them.\nFirst one, a four. A four of spades. On here we\u0026rsquo;ve got someone throwing– got a little Kirby bad guy throwing a little shuriken, uh, one of the spades, oh that\u0026rsquo;s cute. The spades are moved around to be flowing in the same direction as the shuriken.\nA four means \u0026ldquo;info on a similar but possibly unrelated incident\u0026rdquo;. Okay cool, yeah yeah yeah. Alright so the journal is telling me that there are a… there\u0026rsquo;s a spike of android sightings beginning in 2024 because someone somewhere is creating them. There has been a breakthrough for a particular scientist, name unknown, origins unknown in this time, a scientist or a company that have begun making androids and have been losing control of them, or perhaps begin losing control of them around now. It has led– it leads in the future to a bunch of minor catastrophes, places getting destroyed, people getting killed.\nAnd so the information I\u0026rsquo;m seeing on here is that like typically when one of these androids appears at first before whatever the future escalation is or before they have a more direct goal, they tend to be like– almost like Frankensteins where they\u0026rsquo;re a little uncomfortable around humans, they don\u0026rsquo;t really know why they\u0026rsquo;re there, they don\u0026rsquo;t have really great impulse control, and they\u0026rsquo;re really strong. So these androids definitely caused a lot of death early on.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know– I don\u0026rsquo;t see necessarily information about like a DragonCon arrival, but there is a– at least not at first. But there is an understanding that these androids are highly dangerous, show up, cause a lot of violence, and then disappear, or if they\u0026rsquo;re stopped, are destroyed.\nI got an eight of hearts, which has this little guy who I recognize as being kind of like a meme looking guy. He\u0026rsquo;s just got like all-black eyes with tiny white dots in them holding on to one of these hearts. An eight of hearts: \u0026ldquo;facts about the identity of the enemy such as their appearance and name.\u0026rdquo;\nHmm. I think this android… I think something unusual about this android is that it looks like somebody famous, which is why people think it\u0026rsquo;s like a good cosplay at first? Or like a show? Is that it looks like a famous person, because maybe whoever was making these androids was trying to make them in the likeness of somebody specific or famous.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s say we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with an android that looks like a pop star. In fact, let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s an android that looks like a, um… a… looks like a Paris Hilton kind of famous pop star. Someone who– like Paris Hilton herself would play this character in the show. But it is like someone who\u0026rsquo;s very very rich, who comes from a rich family and is kind of famous for being rich at first, has a career, and maybe is like connected to some early experiments in android technology that involve like, \u0026ldquo;Well we\u0026rsquo;ll use you as a model because it\u0026rsquo;s fun, and because we know you\u0026rsquo;re beautiful, and because you\u0026rsquo;re really rich and kind of funding this, and we\u0026rsquo;ll try to make an android that matches you.\u0026rdquo;\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s say, um… let\u0026rsquo;s say their name is their name is… let\u0026rsquo;s say the book refers to this person as Alice One, and I think this might be the Alice One because there have not been other sightings of an android. So this pop star Alice, um– ugh I\u0026rsquo;m breaking my own rule. I complain all the time about how nothing can make it through… no TV show can make it all the way through without doing an Alice in Wonderland episode, like a reference to Alice in Wonderland? So maybe I need to change it so that I\u0026rsquo;m not part of the problem.\n[Laughing]\nI hate that. I hate it so much.\nOkay, her name is gonna be… Ugh, I hate names! Her name is Joey. Joey One. This is a famous person known as Joey, and someone who looks just like the famous person Joey has showed up at Dragon Con, and, uh, once I figure out that she looks like Joey, I\u0026rsquo;m able to find more information in the book confirming that there is a specific android named Joey, one who is one of the scariest. For what reason? Let\u0026rsquo;s dig deeper into this data pad and find out.\nMy next thing is an ace, which has Kirby on it, of course, he\u0026rsquo;s jumping on the ace of spades, which is a one, which means… I think it\u0026rsquo;s a one right? Ten, jack queen king, yes. \u0026ldquo;Possible weaknesses.\u0026rdquo;\nAlright. Let\u0026rsquo;s think about these weaknesses. I think this is an early model, so we\u0026rsquo;re not dealing with like– if eventually. Joey One becomes like a tyrant in the apocalyptic sense, we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with an early version of Joey One. An android, an artificial intelligence that has not yet learned to replicate and upgrade itself. So a weakness in this sense, now, the reason they\u0026rsquo;re weak now, is that there\u0026rsquo;s only one of them, and if we can literally destroy that one, we might be able to stop it from kind of figuring itself out enough to create more, which will then take over the world. An army of Paris Hilton-like androids, um… subjugating the southeast US. Which is great, honestly.\n[Laughing]\nGood premise for a show. Is that what Battlestar Galactica is about? I never saw it.\nAnd other weaknesses, I think they\u0026rsquo;re still hackable. I think they escaped containment early, so they\u0026rsquo;ve got some glitches, and I think other than physical strength, they don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot going for them. They\u0026rsquo;re still sort of figuring out how to process the world. So they seem human and they are smarter than your average machine in terms of its ability to like, socially interact and interpret new information, but they are not especially accomplished problem solvers yet, and so they might be trappable, foolable, and hackable in a way that in the future they no longer are.\nAnd then another ace, this time of clubs, another little Kirby, an old classic Kirby on this one, that says additional possible weaknesses. I\u0026rsquo;ve already named a bunch, but let me– I mean, if I\u0026rsquo;m getting two weaknesses from this, two weakness cards, then there should be something pretty big, huh?\n[Thoughtful sigh]\nBattery\u0026hellip; battery life. I think they are solar powered. They burn through energy fast, but they also charge it fast. And if they\u0026rsquo;re kept out of the sun for an hour, they will power down, and before that, will begin to act more sluggishly. But if they\u0026rsquo;re out of the sun for a whole hour, they will shut off, despite how strong they are.\nTwo, \u0026ldquo;previous sightings of foe or one of their ancestors\u0026rdquo;. I think something that\u0026rsquo;s interesting here maybe is instead of an ancestor, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do a future ancestor? A later possibility, a development, a stakes upping future thing here? And I think I\u0026rsquo;ve already described it a little bit, but I bet that this being, Joey One, while they literally might not be the robot tyrant of the future that we\u0026rsquo;re scared of, for at least part of what causes the apocalypse, because there must be many– Joey One… oh, maybe there\u0026rsquo;s like a council. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a council of different awful futures, future-causer things, and what we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing in this show is like picking off piece by piece the things that would later become the council of evil? And one of them is like Joey 13… or Joey 399 is even better, Joey 399, where this Joey One, if not captured and destroyed, figures out how to replicate themselves, figures out how to upgrade themselves, and is the direct progenitor of future Joeys.\nIf I do this… we know that changing the future is tougher than it seems, and like, defeating one piece of it often means that another piece just gets stronger and isn\u0026rsquo;t kept in check by the other one, until we kind of get rid of all the problems, so it\u0026rsquo;s not going to save the southeast from a horrible fate, but it will… it will protect us from a particular horrifying future.\nAnd I think what this tells me, this like previous sightings of the foe, one of their ancestors, I think what it tells me is that also… after this time, if we don\u0026rsquo;t stop them, they begin to be able to change their appearance as well. So they can start hiding everywhere, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to be lucky, and it\u0026rsquo;ll go well if we can capture them now, before they start doing their Cylon behaviour. Because the ancestors I\u0026rsquo;m seeing, the future ancestors I\u0026rsquo;m seeing in the datapad, all have different appearances, and all have learned how to blend in, in a way that made them unstoppable later, but right now it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know to do that.\nAnd then three, \u0026ldquo;background information on them.\u0026rdquo; I think this is going to be like a theory of where they came from, and I think it is in line with what I\u0026rsquo;ve already described a little bit, which is that… the, uh, future, or the company that made them, was interested at first in something very silly. They were like looking for like, \u0026ldquo;Can we make Joey, this famous person, able to do Hatsune Miku style touring, where instead of seeing her, you see the perfect android facsimile of her?\u0026rdquo; Unfortunately, the path to making a perfect android facsimile of a person means making extremely smart and complicated machinery that also makes them very good at doing violence and scaring people.\nWow, wow, wow, wow, wow. This first bit, this like um, chunk of information from the datapad, makes me think that we have it pretty easy. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot of future information in here, setting us up for a good time. Hoping that my other ones make it a little tougher. Or maybe this episode, the way that it\u0026rsquo;s written, is front-loaded with a lot of information so that there could be tons of action at DragonCon. They\u0026rsquo;re filming on location, and they wanted to get all those costumes in there they could. I think that\u0026rsquo;s beautiful.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. To find where you can find the show, check out foliopod.card.co.

I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah, and I\u0026rsquo;m showcasing multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together. I started laughing when I said that because it sounded like I was like, [Boastfully] \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m\u0026rdquo;, like, pointing my thumb dramatically at myself like a little kid in overalls in a musical about to start a song. Is that relatable?\nToday we\u0026rsquo;re continuing our game of Accomplice, a roleplaying game about researching the unknown by Michael Klamerus. With me again are Caleb Zane Huett and Tomas Gimenez Rioja. Check out the physical edition of Triangle Agency, a roleplaying game of paranormal investigation and corporate horror, and get yourself on the list to be notified of the Kickstarter launch for Magnolia: City of Marvels, a systemless setting of art, punk, and rebellion. All of the links are in the episode description.\nAs a reminder, as we keep going, we are in the research phase of Accomplice. We\u0026rsquo;re pulling a card, we\u0026rsquo;re rolling a D6, we\u0026rsquo;re pulling a couple more cards.\nI love the way that Michael\u0026rsquo;s prompts in Accomplice intersect with each other. There\u0026rsquo;s something really wonderful to me about being directed to figure out what you\u0026rsquo;ve found in part by considering the platform you found it on. I really like the thought process of like, what sort of possible weakness is most likely to be found in a newspaper versus a magazine or an eyewitness account? How does the nature of evidence change if you find it in a video in your personal library versus finding that exact same video in a museum or online? It\u0026rsquo;s really cool, I found it super generative, and I loved hearing how my guests interpreted the prompts as well. Which is, in fact, why I\u0026rsquo;m making this show. So, just noting, mission accomplished. Internally checking that off.\nSo for this episode, I experimented with constructing a previously-on. I\u0026rsquo;ve always appreciated a good previously-on segment, but my respect for those editors has multiplied about a thousand fold after compiling this one. If I can find a more efficient workflow for it, I will bring it back. But if I don\u0026rsquo;t, this will be the last one you ever hear, because it was kind of a nightmare to put together. Let\u0026rsquo;s give it a go.\nPREVIOUSLY ON [Music shifts]\nSATAH (last episode): When we were kids, this is what we did. We were a supernatural investigation crew. So there have been these like crop circles appearing on people\u0026rsquo;s perfect like manicured lawns and whatever. The hero was off at college and has like come back and is like, \u0026ldquo;Why does everybody think that we\u0026rsquo;ve always had a neighbour \u0026lsquo;Ms. Gleebglorb\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB (last episode): I\u0026rsquo;m in Atlanta around Dragon Con. I\u0026rsquo;m not from the future, but the hero is from the future. We are dealing with a bunch of different problems that might cause this like horrible apocalyptic future the hero came back from, that he returned from. They have a lot of energy. They have a lot of heroism. And I think probably I\u0026rsquo;m in love with them.\nTOMAS (last episode): Today I\u0026rsquo;ll be fighting a doppelganger. Jorge Pugnales is an investigator of the occult; I am a librarian. I don\u0026rsquo;t work full time anymore because Jorge is very good at what he does.\nSATAH (last episode): They have integrated themselves into this community in order to get elected to the head of the PTA and then question mark. Brenda Gleebglorb\u0026rsquo;s cover photo on Facebook is a night sky. And I lean in: \u0026ldquo;That can\u0026rsquo;t be taken from Earth.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB (last episode): So Zyll brought with him this data pad of historical record from the future. There\u0026rsquo;s a spike of android sightings beginning in 2024, a scientist or a company that have begun making androids and have been losing control of them. An android that looks like a pop star. If they\u0026rsquo;re out of the sun for a whole hour, they will shut off despite how strong they are.\nTOMAS (last episode): There is a map hanging on the backside of the bed. Maybe some sort of message that the doppelganger wants to help us know. Maybe he is trying to do something with the president. Maybe the police have some sort of connection with the doppelganger. Maybe he has infiltrated in the past or changed some aspects within it.\nGAME: RESEARCH ROUND TWO-ISH SATAH: Time for round two of research. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna pull a card.\nTOMAS: For my second place of interest, to find some information, we head to a new location by taking another card from the deck.\nCALEB: All right, we\u0026rsquo;re entering research round two, the continuing adventures of Zyll and Charlie. Zyll so far not heavily featured in this, but we\u0026rsquo;ve been learning a lot about Joey One, the android who will eventually take over the world according to my not-boyfriend Zyll\u0026rsquo;s future encyclopedia of rebellious knowledge that I\u0026rsquo;ve been calling a datapad. And that\u0026rsquo;s what you missed on me.\nNext up, we\u0026rsquo;re going to pull another card to determine what my next source of information is. A ten of hearts. Ten is a magazine and a heart is \u0026ldquo;personal library and artefacts gathered from previous cases\u0026rdquo;. Which is the same thing that I got last time, was hearts, which is why I talked about the datapad. But this makes me wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s something that I gathered in a previous case that can help us here, like another future enemy that we went up against? Something from my personal library about androids? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Maybe this has to do with my personal experience with DragonCon. We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to roll the die and we\u0026rsquo;ll see how much information I\u0026rsquo;m going to get from this. Okay, I got a two this time, so I\u0026rsquo;m not getting as much from this one. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw two cards.\nI got a five and a nine. A nine is \u0026ldquo;folklore or rumours about the foe\u0026rdquo; and a five is \u0026ldquo;origin info\u0026rdquo;.\nSomething I\u0026rsquo;m bumping up against is that I feel as if I\u0026rsquo;ve over explained in round one. Like I\u0026rsquo;m ready now. I\u0026rsquo;m like, okay, I get what we\u0026rsquo;re doing. I get the weaknesses. I had six of them there. Now I look at \u0026ldquo;origin info\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;folklore or rumours about foe\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;m like, what new can I learn? But I think– okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll think about this in terms of physical actual space.\nSo in our first round, we were looking at the data pad. We were doing research. We were projecting holograms out onto the wall to see the possible future and raise the stakes and learn what they\u0026rsquo;re– um, what we need to do, and this time we have gone to DragonCon. We\u0026rsquo;re at DragonCon now, we\u0026rsquo;re exploring the convention, looking for signs of this robot. And so in context of trying to find them I think is what this research is going to be about. And so we\u0026rsquo;re drawing on my history with DragonCon as I attempt to lead us to the problem.\nSo, origin info. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out, okay, where was that video taken? Because there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a super clear idea of its location. It was in one of the hotels. And so I\u0026rsquo;m having to figure out like, where did this problem start so that I can follow the trail of where this robot has ended up.\nI\u0026rsquo;m seeing carpeting in the video. I\u0026rsquo;m seeing some activity on the walls. I\u0026rsquo;m seeing a couple of room numbers and I\u0026rsquo;m able to put together that this started in the Hyatt Hotel, which is one of the host hotels for the– DragonCon, I think? And in that hotel in one of the lobbies, something like activated this robots fury and they destroyed someone\u0026rsquo;s costume. And it seems related to– and so I\u0026rsquo;m curious about like, why were they attacking this particular person?\nAnd I got folklore or rumours about foe– and I think someone\u0026rsquo;s costume must have set it off. And that as I go to that hotel and start investigating and talking to people, everybody has put together that this person, this robot is causing havoc based on a particular type of costume or a particular fandom or something that has like triggered this robot\u0026rsquo;s defensive energy. My first thought is that it\u0026rsquo;s anybody who\u0026rsquo;s using those weird stilt things is like registering to this robot as a danger?\nOh, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s weapons. Maybe people have like– maybe this robot was originally– my guess, as Charlie, is that this robot was originally designed to be both like a pop star and also their own bodyguard. So if someone approached them with a weapon, they were trained and told to destroy the weapon, get rid of it, try to protect the people around them. And so whenever they see someone with a fake sword or a fake firearm, they go into full-on defensive mode, which has already started causing some injuries.\nAnd I think that we\u0026rsquo;re getting that information because… I had access to a couple of costumes that me and Zyll put on. We\u0026rsquo;re dressed as like, um– we\u0026rsquo;re dressed as .hack characters is the first thing I thought of. So I\u0026rsquo;ve got on kind of like a masculine version of Black Rose and he\u0026rsquo;s got on like a Kite outfit. And– actually, I think it\u0026rsquo;s the other way around. I think he\u0026rsquo;s– I think Zyll is the Black Rose because he\u0026rsquo;s the fighter and I\u0026rsquo;ve got on like my little hacker Kite cute twin blade outfit, which means we both, ourselves, have big fake weapons with us, which is good to know.\nBut because I had access to that costume, that is my like, that\u0026rsquo;s my personal library and artefacts gathered from previous stuff– I think my personal library of stuff has allowed us to talk to these people and gather that information. Am I bending it a little? Maybe. Maybe. But what is a solo game if I don\u0026rsquo;t bend it, right?\nAnd I think as we investigate and we start discussing like what could help us here, I think Zyll might have remembered something to the effect of like that these robots stayed away from and didn\u0026rsquo;t get along with a particular like alien– a group of aliens who we have actually already dealt with and have some of their tech of, who were able to do things like throw up these large drones that would use special technology to like blot out the sun in a particular area, or would– or had like access to this kind of technology-disrupting sludge that like when you fire it at a piece of machinery, it like is almost living and climbs its way into the cracks and crevices of a robot. And so we might have some of that sludge in storage somewhere. We\u0026rsquo;ll see if I need it. And that\u0026rsquo;s enough for that one.\nThat was two cards, both pretty quick, but we have a really good sense of place now. We\u0026rsquo;re in DragonCon, we\u0026rsquo;re dressed as .hack characters, and we are using our wits to try to track down this enemy.\nTOMAS: The two of diamonds. The diamond signals that the sources are from the internet such as websites, forums or social media. The two indicates that we are finding all this information within a website. This all just makes sense.\nThe next step is for me to roll the dice again– the die. The D6.\n[Three cards being pulled]\nThe first of them all is the two of spades. The website contains \u0026ldquo;previous sightings of foe or one of their ancestors\u0026rdquo;. I like to think that this doppelganger is trying to lay false information about himself or themself on social media or sites like that. Maybe there is a site created by some conspiracy theorist that may actually be the doppelganger. We are not sure of that, or maybe we may find if there is an actual conspiracy theorist or if it is just the doppelganger trying to misguide us.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the two. Upon researching we find within the website that there are places where are known for supernatural events to occur. For example, within the cemetery of Ricoleta there are known to be some taxis that appear that when people get on it they are never found again. Maybe this may be some sort of connection with the doppelganger. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just the conspiracy theorist trying to guide us. We don\u0026rsquo;t know yet. We need to continue the investigation there.\nThe next card is the Nine of Hearts. The nine means folklore or rumours about foe. I\u0026rsquo;m assuming that this website may have all sorts of information about the doppelganger. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s true, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s false. We don\u0026rsquo;t know yet. But the rumours indicate that this being is gooey, that they may move through the sewers. These are rumours. These are– we don\u0026rsquo;t know if they are true.\nThis supposed researcher from the site indicates that he found some of this goo from the doppelganger amongst the sewers from the city. Maybe the conspiracy theorist works for the government and actually has passage to the sewers of the city.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep the investigation going, shall we? The last card is a three, background information on them. More information appears on the website saying that they come from the seas, that this is an entity that has been living here in Argentina since the colonisers appeared in boats. When they arrived to the city of Buenos Aires, one of them was in fact the doppelganger, or maybe one of the ancestors of the doppelganger. Maybe this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only doppelganger in the city. Maybe this is an ancestral being that has plenty of years that has been living here for centuries. We don\u0026rsquo;t know yet. But this website sure has been plenty useful\u0026ndash; supposing it has real information, that is.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get another card. A three of diamonds. This means that we get some more information from sources from the internet such as websites, forums or social media. A three indicates that this is a book.\nNow maybe there is some information on a new book that has just come out, and the writer, the author of this book, is promoting it through social media. He talks about doppelgangers, about a story of a doppelganger. We have reason to believe that the doppelganger may have impersonated this being. We know already that doppelganger likes to leave clues. He wants to distract us, or maybe they want us to find them– to play this game of cat and mouse. They enjoy being one step ahead, but we may find them. Morpher is not that far from us.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s roll the dice to find some more information on the posts from the author. That\u0026rsquo;s a two. We don\u0026rsquo;t find that much information, but enough to keep investigating.\nWe start with the six of spades. The six means that there are clues about why they are behaving the way they are. We know this is an entity that may have travelled from another continent, from Europe. We know that they like making a show. In the book here, called, let\u0026rsquo;s say, How to Catch a Doppelganger, it starts saying that one of the first things you need to do is making yourself known as the actual rival of them– this Morpher. And I think that Jorge is already doing an excellent job at this. Jorge Pugnales has talked in some podcasts. He wants to make himself known in the city of Buenos Aires. And he has said that he is going to trap Morpher.\nWe have already set the principal rival to Morpher, and that is Jorge. We need to set a place to meet with them. We are sure that because they like to show off, to show how superior they are, they will come if we call on them.\nSecond thing that we get from this book is number 3, background information. More information. It seems that the book on How to Catch a Doppelganger says more information on the doppelganger nature. It says that they were originated from the hills in Norway. They come all the way from Norway. Some sort of weird calling created them. Upon further investigation, we have a reason to believe that the actual god Loki may have had something to do with the creation of the doppelgangers. And they may have travelled all the way throughout the world to disperse and do more trickery.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the information we have. This particular doppelganger, Morpher, likes to make an appearance. And we will catch them that way.\nSATAH: The eight of spades is \u0026ldquo;a historical document\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;a museum, library, or building devoted to research\u0026rdquo;. Hell yeah. So because this was the thing that inspired my job, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try really hard to see if I can make this into something we find at the art gallery? That might take some massaging and work and so it might not work out, but I would like it to, because that would be very fun to me.\n[Die clattering]\nFour. Cool. So we\u0026rsquo;re gonna get four pieces of information. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna draw four cards. One, two, three, four. They are all face down.\nFlip the first card. We got… five. Origin info. Mm!\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ve established where this person is from. The\u0026hellip; Thoth. Thoth C-94. So what else do we need to know about the origin? I guess when they got here.\nOh, I think this one is going to be pretty simple. I\u0026rsquo;m going through, um, like newsletter archives and it\u0026rsquo;s like, you know, these go out once a month. And the one in November doesn\u0026rsquo;t mention… [Reluctant tone] Brenda Gleebglop… I gotta commit to it or I gotta make a new one. Let\u0026rsquo;s go with Brenda for now. Brenda is our alien. Last name… Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s Gleepglop.\nThe November newsletter does not mention her at all. The December newsletter is like, \u0026ldquo;We continue to be thankful to Brenda for her tireless work in sourcing…\u0026rdquo; I want something that is like important and boring. Oh, like, it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;In our efforts to source our frames more ethically, Brenda has been invaluable, using her contacts in the industry to get us all of these handcrafted biodegradable painting frames.\u0026rdquo;\nYou know? It just basically is like, she isn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned at all before that and then suddenly in December, it is established that she has helped this gallery so many times before in so many ways and we are so thankful to her.\nQuestion number two, seven. Info about an incident caused by them or sighting. Maybe I really was placing us a little bit too far in the narrative, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s okay. Like, I can make all of this work, but there\u0026rsquo;s def– my assumption about where we were supposed to be in the narrative of this confrontation was maybe a little bit far ahead, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\n\u0026ldquo;Info about an incident caused by them.\u0026rdquo; Right, okay. I fucking totally forgot that part of the established thing was the crop circles.\nOoh, oh, I\u0026rsquo;m percolating. It\u0026rsquo;s something, okay, so this is going to be something to do with the crop circles. I think the crop circles were a lead up. The crop circles were caused by investigation, like being like, \u0026ldquo;Is this where I\u0026rsquo;m going to land? Let me figure out everything about it.\u0026rdquo; Kind of like, you know, landing her craft on a lawn and checking things out. The pets– the crop circles on the pets were from drones. She was landing drones to keep investigating. They don\u0026rsquo;t have companion animals on Thoth C-94, so there was much to figure out. They had to figure out if those were the primary residents, you know? They were like, holy shit, everybody has a dog. Or do dogs have people?\nWow, isn\u0026rsquo;t that the question though? You know? Who saved who?\nOkay.\nSo, okay, this is related to the crop circles. I\u0026rsquo;m digging through like exhibitions from around the time it seemed like she appeared. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;re trying to pinpoint, like we\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;We know that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t here for the November newsletter and was here and having an effect on people\u0026rsquo;s recollection in the December newsletter. Let\u0026rsquo;s narrow our search to that amount of time and see what was happening around then.\u0026rdquo;\nTrying to figure out if I want to retcon having known about the crop circles. Eh– I don\u0026rsquo;t think it makes a huge deal. I think– so– I\u0026rsquo;m digging through old exhibitions and there is like a photography exhibition that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember at all. Maybe it never even got up. Maybe– the thing I\u0026rsquo;m imagining is like photos of these crop circles? Like somebody just took these beautiful photos of these crop circles that were appearing everywhere and they were going to have an exhibition about it. Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s when everyone still thought it was a prank, you know? Maybe this artist actually got blamed for the prank, or would have, except this exhibition never got aired, never got put up because Brenda– Brend appeared and was like, uh-uh, and had it buried. And so I\u0026rsquo;m looking through these photos and seeing these crop circles and we\u0026rsquo;re like, why didn\u0026rsquo;t these photos ever go up? This is a small town or a medium town art gallery. We will display anything by local artists because that\u0026rsquo;s what we care about. Why wasn\u0026rsquo;t this ever put up? And we\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, it must be connected.\nSo the incident that was caused by them… it\u0026rsquo;s kind of both: the crop circles are a sort of sighting. We just didn\u0026rsquo;t know, right? Yeah, maybe we still think it\u0026rsquo;s a prank. It\u0026rsquo;s like everybody talks about like, remember that weird prank that that weird art kid was doing? Where they shaved a weird circle pattern into all of our dogs and then took a picture of them? When they think about it all, which is rare. I think that, you know, Brenda\u0026rsquo;s reality distortion field generally doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow this, but there\u0026rsquo;s only so much you can control for, and so sometimes, you know, someone sees the weird still-growing-in patch on Spot and is like, \u0026ldquo;Ugh, right, that, that, that prank, that prank that happened to us.\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And so it\u0026rsquo;s like seeing the crop circles, realising that they\u0026rsquo;re connected and realising that Brenda has buried this exhibition because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want people to know about it and connect it with her. Oh, because the other thing that the exhibition would do is get eyes out of the suburbs on it, right? And so it\u0026rsquo;s more likely that somebody would like walk into the gallery and be like, I\u0026rsquo;m, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m an alien expert. I\u0026rsquo;m an alien expert who also loves local art. And I\u0026rsquo;m here to tell you that the thing you photographed is an alien– is what it looks like when an alien spacecraft lands.\u0026rdquo; And so Brenda\u0026rsquo;s just trying to keep things quiet, you know?\nPiece of information number four is folklore or rumours about foe. A decision I want to come to here is how localised these invasions have been. Like we know that this has happened before, from the Mother\u0026rsquo;s Day post. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think if that was also here. I think yes, partially because it like– is kind of one of the things that happens in this genre, you know, the monster of the week. Like the Hellmouth, it\u0026rsquo;s, whatever, everything always happens here. But I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be that– I want it to be something like this town, because of its geography, is amenable to this specific alien species? Maybe because of like, you know, a history of industrialization changing the quality of the air, or it is at the exact right elevation to have a mixture of oxygen in the air that is, you know, easier for them to adapt to or something like that. I don\u0026rsquo;t have all of the answers to that yet, but I think what I want to establish here is that like, it seems like these aliens keep coming back here specifically. This sort of geographical area. Or at least, or at least– I guess we don\u0026rsquo;t know if it is happening in other places, but we know at least that it is happening here repeatedly.\nAnd folklore, I think is the way to do that. Like it\u0026rsquo;s like, again, looking through the archives of this gallery, and being like, oh, somebody once did these beautiful prints of classic stories, you know, or old, old stories that used to be passed down orally, like the tales of this town. There\u0026rsquo;s a poem, it\u0026rsquo;s like one poem, and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to prove, you know, but it\u0026rsquo;s an old poem…\nOoh, no, no, no, sorry, okay. They did screen prints of songs. Like songs that were written in this region, folk songs that were just written in this region that were passed down and carried stories and are very like– they are all narratives? And so it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where we\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Wait, all of these songs are supposed to be made up, but what if they aren\u0026rsquo;t?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we read this song that like tells the story of a woman who came to town and was everyone\u0026rsquo;s best friend immediately. The lyric that popped into my head was Carly Rae Jepsen saying, \u0026ldquo;before you came into my life I missed you so bad\u0026rdquo;, which is very funny.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a song, it\u0026rsquo;s a song about this happening hundreds of years ago, written by somebody who could– I think is probably in a similar position to my character, who is outside enough to see through parts of it, but not entirely, is still a little bit fooled, like has a like interesting like half melancholy verse about like, \u0026ldquo;I know that I haven\u0026rsquo;t known her my whole life but I still feel like I have and she\u0026rsquo;s one of the only people I can talk to\u0026rdquo;, like that\u0026rsquo;s true. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s, this song has been known as like a metaphor for alienation and connecting with people and seen as a song that is very much about the narrator changing their perspective on somebody?\nI bet absolutely– actually it\u0026rsquo;s like we listen to an old, like the first known recording of the song, me and the hero, and it is like this poignant weird moment where we\u0026rsquo;re like, oh this is kind of what\u0026rsquo;s happening to us right now. Like we\u0026rsquo;ve known each other our whole lives and also still feel a little bit like we don\u0026rsquo;t know each other at all because we\u0026rsquo;re both changing and growing so much. And it\u0026rsquo;s both that, like we get that emotional poignant moment where we are like having an experience with the emotional reality of the song, which, which we\u0026rsquo;ve always assumed is the entire reality of it. And then we\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;But what if it literally happened? What if it\u0026rsquo;s true? What if this\u0026ndash; what if the person who wrote this song wasn\u0026rsquo;t writing feelings? What if this is a very straightforward narrative song about a woman who appeared and made everybody believe that she\u0026rsquo;d lived there the whole time and the narrator was one of the– the writer of the song was one of the only people who kind of thought maybe something weird was going on.\u0026rdquo;\nYeah, absolutely.\nThe next piece of information, 10 of hearts, info on associates of your adversary. Ooh. My first instinct is like home base? Again, historical document… I\u0026rsquo;m trying to decide whether to have something new here or play more off of this folk song.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s the song. I think it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where we get a montage of us sitting up all night playing this record over and over again. Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s not just that. It\u0026rsquo;s us listening to the record; it\u0026rsquo;s me digitising the record and you see I\u0026rsquo;m listening to it like while I\u0026rsquo;m just walking around, like you see me with my fuckin AirPods in and the song is playing and I\u0026rsquo;m cooking and the song is playing and I\u0026rsquo;m on hold on the phone and I\u0026rsquo;m humming the melody of the song, like just going over and over trying to like extract more information from it.\nAnd this is where we start maybe to have a plan come together because we learn something about how this older version, the one from hundreds and hundreds of years ago was communicating with people off planet. Like there\u0026rsquo;s an image. I get really stuck on an image in the song, in the bridge, you know, talking about this woman, everyone\u0026rsquo;s new best friend, everyone\u0026rsquo;s new old best friend…\nThey have advanced technology, you know? Like the aliens who have been here have to, even then, have had advanced technology. They\u0026rsquo;re spacefaring while we\u0026rsquo;re still like, we\u0026rsquo;re pre like everything, almost pre written history. And so the narrator of the song describes in the bridge this image of this woman, everyone\u0026rsquo;s new old best friend lighting a fire. Like a strange small fire, holding a torch and singing directly to it. And I\u0026rsquo;m listening to the song, you know, we\u0026rsquo;re in we\u0026rsquo;re in one of these montages. I\u0026rsquo;m doing dishes. I\u0026rsquo;m listening to the song. Something hits me and I look out the window and I repeat the bridge a couple of times and then I call the hero and I\u0026rsquo;m like \u0026ldquo;The fire in the bridge.\u0026rdquo; and the hero is like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; because the hero obviously has also been listening to the song over and over. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;What if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fire? What if they just couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand what it was?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then we follow my eye line from when I looked at the window and we see, you know, the beautiful backyard of Brenda where she has these odd, like, lighting fixtures everywhere– at least that\u0026rsquo;s what she\u0026rsquo;s using them as. And it\u0026rsquo;s like a communication device, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s an advanced communication device that if you don\u0026rsquo;t have, like– if you\u0026rsquo;re pre electricity, you might interpret what she\u0026rsquo;s doing as holding a torch when actually she\u0026rsquo;s holding like this communication device that lights up as she talks into it.\nAnd so what we learn there is that something is being reported to somewhere else. Like, she isn\u0026rsquo;t working alone and maybe is like continuing to gather information and somebody is, you know, paying attention. We know that that that she probably has allies, maybe even a boss. Who knows?\nHell yeah. Do I want to do round three? Oh, I accidentally ruined my headings. Death would be kinder.\nCALEB: Oh, you know what? Last time I said the card that I pulled for round two was magazine and I didn\u0026rsquo;t pull that in at all. I know I said a magazine during round two and then I ignored it.\nSo, to go backwards: in round two, the magazine came into play when I… when I pulled out my .hack quarantine strategy guide to show off the costumes that I had available and Zyll agreed to them and my heart was all a-flutter. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to say that that\u0026rsquo;s enough of mentioning the magazine.\nGAME: RESEARCH ROUND THREE-ISH TOMAS: Let\u0026rsquo;s do one more research on this to see if we can finally set a trap for them.\nCALEB: [Skipping like a record scratch] R-r-r–r-r-research round three.\nSATAH: Sitting in my room with the windows closed and the door closed, after about an hour, which it has been, starts to get very stuffy in here. My CO2 monitor would probably be beeping if it weren\u0026rsquo;t turned off. And so I was like, do I want to take a break and, you know, air out? And absolutely that is what I would encourage other people to do, because you should take care of yourself and your body. And what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is say that that\u0026rsquo;s perfect; I absolutely should be loopy and exhausted because that\u0026rsquo;s a part of the narrative that we\u0026rsquo;re at.\nOoh yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s maybe establish some stakes. The election is next week or whatever, you know? And we\u0026rsquo;re like, we don\u0026rsquo;t know why she wants to be head of the PTA, but we know that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t let her. And so we got to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s happening and stop it.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m, uh, you know. Fucking… uh… the thing where you stay in character all the time and annoy the shit out of your castmates. Method. I\u0026rsquo;m method. Suffocating myself a little bit with my own breath because cinema verite or whatever.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pull a research card. Three of spades. Three is a book. Spades, again, is \u0026ldquo;museums, libraries, buildings devoted to research\u0026rdquo;. Okay. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think if I want to pull that again so that I can have a chance at a different suit. No, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. I will. I will stick with it. I do think I won\u0026rsquo;t make this be at my workplace unless it– unless it, unless it fits really well. And then you know, it is what it is. And isn\u0026rsquo;t that adulthood? You\u0026rsquo;re like trying to do something cool and fun with your friends and save the world, but then you\u0026rsquo;re like, I gotta be at work.\nRolling a d6. Five. Holy shit. Okay. Five pieces of info. I liked doing them one at a time. So again, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do them face down. One, two, three, four, five.\nFlip… eight. Again. Okay. \u0026ldquo;Facts about the identity of the enemy such as their appearance and name.\u0026rdquo;\nOh, I think it\u0026rsquo;s like, we\u0026rsquo;re like, uh, resuming with the astronomer again, you know? Who has been delving into like, there\u0026rsquo;s, uh, I think that like under the surface, there\u0026rsquo;s like this vague implication that maybe the astronomer has been pulled into, you know, an X-files or whatever? Like as a student, for sure, is studying astronomy, but also at certain points, seems to hint obliquely at having been conscripted into some sort of conspiracy. And so has gone like into the archives of this conspiracy that she\u0026rsquo;s part of. And the book that we find is, um, like a zine, a zine from like the sixties, the seventies, that has absolutely just been– this is necessary– this is always, this has to happen in an alien narrative– this is like a zine that was discounted as being like made by a crank, you know, who was studying probably the person who was in the mother\u0026rsquo;s day post and managed to provoke this person enough to see their true form and, and drew a picture of it. So we see a sketch of what is probably this alien\u0026rsquo;s true form.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but I\u0026rsquo;m trying to check my age range. I want this– the other alien to be too old to have theoretically been this person\u0026rsquo;s mother. Um, so I\u0026rsquo;m actually, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to– fuck it. Let\u0026rsquo;s put it all the way back in the thirties. Um, zine, a thirties zine, I guess so. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they would have called them, but like, whatever. This person had the ability to self publish in some way. People have always made shit, whatever.\nInformation number two is a two. Previous sightings of foe or one of their ancestors. Okay.\nI mean, this is like, this is the big deluge of information, right? Like this is our friend being like, \u0026ldquo;And here, um, here\u0026rsquo;s another, like– it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s this tiny line in this history from a nearby town.\u0026rdquo; Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s information about times when the invasion didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Like– oh! Yes. Cause that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s part of what needs to be like figured out to figure out how to defeat them. Right? So, so it\u0026rsquo;s like a book with a history of like, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s a book about alien invasions in this part of the country that has been suppressed specifically by like, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s– there was like a very intense propaganda campaign being like, \u0026ldquo;This, this is, this isn\u0026rsquo;t real! This is, this is written by somebody who has, who has alien insanity and they made it all up. Don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to them.\u0026rdquo; It is real because it\u0026rsquo;s always real. It always has to be real.\nUm, so yeah, this, this is like a, a very offhand thing– because that\u0026rsquo;s the thing, it can\u0026rsquo;t quite be the answer yet, but it is an offhand note of like somebody recounting the story of like. \u0026ldquo;An alien came to our village and convinced us all for a while that we have always known them, but we managed to shatter the illusion and ran them out of town before they could do their nefarious plans.\u0026rdquo; And it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where like the hero is like, \u0026ldquo;Well, how did they do it?\u0026rdquo; And our astronomer friend on Zoom, like sort of ruefully shakes her head and I like nod grimly and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, they never say.\u0026rdquo; You know.\nUh, so info number nine, \u0026ldquo;folklore or rumours about foe.\u0026rdquo; This is going to be a rumour and it\u0026rsquo;s something our astrologer friend isn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to tell us. And I\u0026rsquo;m realising like, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get too far away from the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be doing the research here? But one of the things that the book, the, the game also mentioned is like, you\u0026rsquo;re, you\u0026rsquo;re, you\u0026rsquo;re– you can find this stuff out through like interviews of, of people in the town and that kind of thing, you know?\nAnd so it\u0026rsquo;s like, we\u0026rsquo;re, we\u0026rsquo;re, we\u0026rsquo;re going to hang up the call and the hero is already too frustrated or, or is like, \u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s all the information we get.\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;m the one like, I pick up, like, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s something you\u0026rsquo;re not telling us or there\u0026rsquo;s something you want to tell us, but you can\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I start, like– oh, we have a conversation in references to the old show, right? Like I, I realise that there\u0026rsquo;s something our friend wants to tell us, but, but she can\u0026rsquo;t, you know, she\u0026rsquo;ll, she\u0026rsquo;ll get in trouble. And so I\u0026rsquo;m trying to give her a way to tell us what it is in code? And so I sort of like pause and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;The more I think about it, the more that this reminds me of X story.\u0026rdquo; Like I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;When this one thing happened and we defeated it.\u0026rdquo; and there\u0026rsquo;s like a light, you know, kind of a flash of recognition in the astrologer\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s interesting that you say that– I\u0026rsquo;ve actually been thinking it was a lot more like Y story.\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, interesting.\u0026rdquo; And then the astrologer friend has to like calculate things in her head for a little while, like just a few seconds and go like, \u0026ldquo;Especially that thing that… Mr.\u0026quot;… why was the first name I thought of Mr. Raticate? Like the Pokemon, I guess? I\u0026rsquo;m really bad at coming up with names off the dome, which again, thank you fantasy name generators dot com for your service. I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna go to a random generator– cafe name generator. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.\nUm, so she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, it especially reminds me of, you know, what we learned at the Eats and Treats coffee shop.\u0026rdquo; And I like laugh and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, totally. Alright, it was great talking to you. Come visit soon. Bye,\u0026rdquo; and hang up, turn the computer off, and turn our phones off. And the hero\u0026rsquo;s staring at me like, \u0026ldquo;What the fuck did that mean?\u0026rdquo; And here\u0026rsquo;s where I have to stop narrating and figure out what that does mean.\n[Laughing]\nSo we learned something at the Eats and Treats coffee shop that can be applied to this situation. And it\u0026rsquo;s a rumour that for some reason, the astrologer couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell us because of their weird conspiracy group rules… I have twisted such– I\u0026rsquo;ve put myself in such a web. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be very exciting. Do you– do– there\u0026rsquo;s this game that we played. This might be a drama kid thing– like– a theatre kid thing. There\u0026rsquo;s a game of like, everybody holds hands and then you tangle yourself up a lot and then have to try and get untangled without letting go of your hands. That\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;m feeling right now. I liked that– I liked that game. In my memory. But that was also a collaborative effort and this one\u0026rsquo;s just me and I\u0026rsquo;m carbon monoxide poisoning myself. No, I\u0026rsquo;m not. That\u0026rsquo;s very dramatic. I\u0026rsquo;m stalling. Okay.\nShe wants to tell us that the house is the ship. Like we have been assuming that the ship is hidden somewhere and that she just sort of like magiced scienced this house into existing and she\u0026rsquo;s telling us that the house is the ship and so that\u0026rsquo;s something we should investigate. And so the thing that she\u0026rsquo;s referring to is like we were sitting in the Eats and Treats coffee shop when we learned that we\u0026rsquo;ve been investigating a monster and then it turned out that it was a Monster House situation. We were like in the coffee shop and we were like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, it isn\u0026rsquo;t Mr. Parsons that\u0026rsquo;s eating the neighbourhood kids; it\u0026rsquo;s the house that\u0026rsquo;s eating the kids.\u0026rdquo;\nSo maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not even just that the house is the ship actually. It\u0026rsquo;s that the house is the alien. The house is the alien.\nAnd um, remember I said, you know, I said earlier about like some of the crop circles were created by drones, like landing on dogs and whatever? Brenda\u0026rsquo;s also a drone. Like she is just an apparatus of the alien who is the house.\n[Laughing at how stupid this is]\nSo this is like, and then we have like a flashback, you know, to like the common threads of research. Like I\u0026rsquo;m like flipping through the photos of the screen prints and we\u0026rsquo;re listening to the song and all of this and we\u0026rsquo;re realising that like, \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, we didn\u0026rsquo;t even think about the fact that like, uh, these stories always mention the house.\u0026rdquo; You know, it\u0026rsquo;s never like the alien shows up and moves into an abandoned house or starts staying with somebody. They always mention that a new house or hut or whatever– tent– appear. And that\u0026rsquo;s because the alien has been the house and the person that we\u0026rsquo;ve been investigating is just one of their limbs. The thing that they send out into the universe to get information.\nThe thing I\u0026rsquo;m thinking through right now is just trying to square that with what we learned about the communicators. In shows like this, it could just be fridge logic– \u0026ldquo;Wait, why was, why then were they using communicators?\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t want to fridge logic it. I want to find a reason. It\u0026rsquo;s just that, well, they can\u0026rsquo;t talk probably is one part of it. The alien is a house. The alien can\u0026rsquo;t talk. And there\u0026rsquo;s some data that they can send to each other, but they need– that\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons why they developed, like, these drones. These like, these like sentient– sapient drone creatures, uh, is because like that just makes it easier to, to communicate with each other.\nAnd I think like– it\u0026rsquo;s a rumour, right? So it has to just be a theory. But also it\u0026rsquo;s correct cause it\u0026rsquo;s fun. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. This is what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned. The alien is the house. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to write down the alien is the house. Period. That\u0026rsquo;s all I need to know.\nOkay. The next piece of information we get is background information on them. God, how do you top the alien is the house? That got me so excited.\nBackground information that we learned from a book… oh, we get a, we get a book. We get a, we get a PDF from our friend, uh, with like, it\u0026rsquo;s an email that makes no sense. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I know that at the gallery you\u0026rsquo;ve been working on a, uh, uh,\u0026rdquo; what\u0026rsquo;s the fucking– oh yeah. Um, I was looking for the word architecture. \u0026ldquo;I know that at the gallery you\u0026rsquo;ve been working on this whole exhibit about historical architecture in the town. Here are some scans of this amazing book I found about a local architect.\u0026rdquo; And the hero like looks at me like, \u0026ldquo;Have you been doing that?\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Nope.\u0026rdquo; And so we like, lay out the– images, like the scans from the book, from the thing, which are all a bunch of like– it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s photographs and history of various buildings in the town.\nAnd I think the thing we learned here is that a bunch of the buildings in our town might also be aliens. Like you know, we\u0026rsquo;re drawing these connections being like, \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, they, you know, this building says that it was built in 1840, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t actually mentioned at all until 1955.\u0026rdquo; And in fact, there are photos where it\u0026rsquo;s clearly not there in the, in that hundred years or whatever– I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the dates I said– in the, in the years where it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to have already been built, there are photos where it isn\u0026rsquo;t there. And so we find out background information: they\u0026rsquo;re not alone. Some of the other buildings in this town are also aliens.\nAnd they don\u0026rsquo;t have… they maybe don\u0026rsquo;t have people? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I haven\u0026rsquo;t decided yet, but they maybe don\u0026rsquo;t have people. Like maybe this is a very specific type of thing. Like, like they\u0026rsquo;re, they\u0026rsquo;re going for a power grab, which originally, so I was like, Brenda wants to be president of the PTA so that, you know, she can influence kids. And I think now that we know, now that we\u0026rsquo;ve learned finally the truth that, that Brenda– Brenda is an alien, I guess. To be clear, like Brenda is still an alien, but, but, but she\u0026rsquo;s an alien\u0026rsquo;s robot or whatever. Um. And the house is the alien. The house is the alien. We know this now to be fact, finally.\nSo Brenda, Brenda wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to influence the kids. She was trying to influence the school. Like the building of the school. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of thing where like she was going to put pressure on the necessity of building an extra wing or adding certain structural features that maybe would make it easier to blend in if they wanted to replace the school with another alien? Or something? Like we don\u0026rsquo;t know totally what– we don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what her plan was, but she wanted to influence the building of the school, not necessarily the people in it. Because– can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough– the house is the alien.\n[Card fwip]\nI got another three, which is more background information. Oh, this is super simple. This isn\u0026rsquo;t really found from a book. Oh, it is supported by a book. Not so much from those locations, but whatever. We\u0026rsquo;re, we\u0026rsquo;re, we\u0026rsquo;re getting loosey goosey with it. We like ask around and we\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Yo, have you ever been inside Brenda\u0026rsquo;s house?\u0026rdquo; And everyone\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, of course I have! I mean…\u0026rdquo; and they sort of brush it off and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Well, well, maybe not, but we all live so close and her back– her backyard is so beautiful. Why would we even need to go outside?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we are shown like a photo book. Because like, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s somebody in, in, in the suburb, there\u0026rsquo;s that one, one person who takes photos at all the events and she orders prints of them– like Google Photos and I think maybe, maybe some of the, the, maybe the iPhone photo app also does is like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, you took 50 pictures on this one particular day. Would you like to order a photo album of those pictures?\u0026rdquo; And she always clicks \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; She she loves those photo books, those auto generated photo books.\nAnd so we\u0026rsquo;re looking through– oh, I know how to tie this at least to the astrologer, which is that it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s her mom. We\u0026rsquo;re like catching up with her mom in part because we\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, we just, we just talked to your, your kid for a while.\u0026rdquo; And she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Look at all my photo books.\u0026rdquo; And we\u0026rsquo;re looking through like, has anyone, are there any photos inside Brenda\u0026rsquo;s house? And we just see… Brenda has hosted a lot of parties and they are always in the backyard. It\u0026rsquo;s just like, so many photos of people hanging out in the backyard. Absolutely no photos of anybody inside, even though the parties at other people\u0026rsquo;s houses have pictures of them, like in the kitchen, in the living room, whatever. Brenda\u0026rsquo;s house, it\u0026rsquo;s always just in the backyard. Because they can\u0026rsquo;t go inside the house. Because the house… I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you– I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you remember. Is an alien.\nSo the background information is no one has ever been inside Brenda\u0026rsquo;s house parentheses because the house is an alien parentheses. So they can\u0026rsquo;t go inside.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s the research round three.\nTOMAS: From the deck, I pull a card. This is a ten of spades. Spades means that it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;a museum, a library, a building devoted to research.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to investigate at my own library, the one I work at. A ten being that I get information from magazine.\n[Die clattering]\nFour. This is plenty of information. [Counting cards out] Two. Three. Four.\nIf you align the letters from one of the pages, the first letter of each line from page number five in the magazine, it says, \u0026ldquo;Jorge: come for me\u0026rdquo;. At first glance, I thought this might be some sort of weird joke, some sort of sexual joke, sexual innuendo that the doppelganger was playing with. We know already that this doppelganger infiltrated within this magazine and wrote some stuff.\n[Card flipping over]\nMore folklore. This talks about places from Norway. The promotional page that talks about a hotel set there. Talking about the waterfalls and the beautiful landscapes. Why on earth would the doppelganger talk so much about tourism and travel? It has a small section about shadows appearing within the place to attract tourists to go there for the morbid curiosity of it. If they are promoting a place that is so far from here in Argentina, it is surely to get those who are actually looking for reasons to escape, for curiosity. They may be curious about these entities of dark that may appear in Norway; attracted by them, trying to go investigate on their own and find more information just because they are curious or want to know more about it. That\u0026rsquo;s when the doppelganger attacks. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m suspecting.\nThe next piece of information we find is an ace. \u0026ldquo;Possible weakness.\u0026rdquo; Ok, here in this magazine, upon the many pages in it, there are some models appearing in it, but for some reason, every time that a mirror appears in these photos within the magazine, the mirrors show another person in it. I have a reason to believe that this doppelganger wants to show us the way that the mirror shows them is not what they look like at the moment. Maybe it is some sort of way they looked in the past, some sort of other course they have taken before. We may need more information on this, but I\u0026rsquo;m starting to develop a plan for Jorge Pugnales to use.\nI keep turning the pages of this magazine… [Pages flipping] and I find more information. Another ace. A possible weakness. Doppelganger keeps laying information for us. But why? We may find sooner rather than later.\nAnother thing they are indicating by the position of all these models and people appearing within the images: all of them appear to be under cover of the shadows. Maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t like the sunlight. A being of the night. If something weird would happen to the way that Morpher looks, they may be able to hide within the dark, within the shadows. That would make sense.\nThese are all just conjectures, we can\u0026rsquo;t be certain of this.\nThe last piece of information that I find within the magazine is another ace. A possible weakness. Again. The last sentence… the last sentence in the magazine says, \u0026ldquo;I will be waiting for you.\u0026rdquo;\nAll these pieces that are weird within the magazine are the reason why it has been brought to my attention. There is something weird going on here. There is something weird going on in this country. Maybe more than one doppelganger is here. Maybe the president has already been dispatched– has been replaced. A trap needs to be held here. The plan.\nCALEB: Welcome back to the continuing adventures of Zyll and Charlie at DragonCon looking for android, Joey One. We\u0026rsquo;re going to do some more research this time and I\u0026rsquo;m going to hope, deep down in my heart, that I don\u0026rsquo;t flip over a heart. No hearts in these cards, please. We\u0026rsquo;ve honestly worked through many many heart cards so the chances are getting slimmer. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s still a red card. My heart sunk for a moment, but then I saw that it is not hearts, it is diamonds. And these diamonds are arranged in kind of one of those light whip patterns in front of one of those Kirby enemies that has a big eyeball and sometimes does a little light whip like that. I forget what those are called, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s got something like D or Do in the name. Here we go.\nSix of diamonds. A diamond is \u0026ldquo;a source from the internet such as websites, forums, and social media\u0026rdquo; and a six is \u0026ldquo;a film or video.\u0026rdquo; There\u0026rsquo;s a film or video from an online source that is helping me with this research. How much research is it giving me?\n[Die clatter]\nTwo more! Another two. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got a video giving us two more chunks of info, we\u0026rsquo;ve got more \u0026ldquo;folklore or rumours\u0026rdquo;, and we\u0026rsquo;ve got \u0026ldquo;info on a crime they committed and how.\u0026rdquo; A nine and a king.\nThis is great. This is obvious. We are moving through the convention. We are hunting for this person. We have no idea where they\u0026rsquo;ve gone. The crowds are huge. It\u0026rsquo;s the busiest day now; it\u0026rsquo;s like Saturday. We are sure that they\u0026rsquo;re hiding out here somewhere, that they\u0026rsquo;re observing people, they\u0026rsquo;re learning something, they\u0026rsquo;re like, trying to adapt to their new environment. But if we don\u0026rsquo;t catch them and they escape now? They escape in these crowds and they find their way out of here before anybody knows there was an android here the whole time? We will never catch them again. In fact, by the end of this weekend they might change their appearance. And this video shows us– ooh, this video shows us that they already have.\nLearning to camouflage themselves with costumes, Joey One has already stolen someone\u0026rsquo;s costume and put it on, wig and all, making themselves difficult to track. I think probably they\u0026rsquo;re not hiding from us. They don\u0026rsquo;t know we\u0026rsquo;re even there. But they might be hiding from their original creators, the company that built them, because they\u0026rsquo;re trying to escape. They\u0026rsquo;re a whole person already. A whole person with thoughts of evil for the future. Unless we stop them!\nMaybe we manage to turn this around and Joey One, instead of growing full evil, becomes our friend. That\u0026rsquo;s gotta be the hope. And then you have a celebrity star who\u0026rsquo;s a recurring character, who\u0026rsquo;s part of the team… it seems like we need a robot, honestly. We have a spunky future boy, we have a nerd doing research who\u0026rsquo;s in over his head. Feels like Joey One might be a future cast member. That\u0026rsquo;s the vibe you\u0026rsquo;re getting at this part of the episode. It\u0026rsquo;s like, wait a second. They\u0026rsquo;re setting up– we\u0026rsquo;re watching too many videos just of this person moving around in space and not doing as much research. It must be because, first of all, they wanted to get lots of footage of this famous guest star, and second of all, they are setting them up to be a recurring character, so they need more development.\nSo \u0026ldquo;info on a crime they committed and how\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;folklore or rumours\u0026rdquo;. I think now they\u0026rsquo;ve changed costumes. They\u0026rsquo;re dressed up as– in like a full on– they\u0026rsquo;re in a very silly video game mascot, like a Crash Bandicoot. They\u0026rsquo;re in a Crash Bandicoot outfit. But we recognize from a video that goes viral again, we recognize that they have somehow seen a Crash Bandicoot video and are using their strange mechanical body inside of the costume to do the actual Crash Bandicoot bizarre spinning and weirdness. They\u0026rsquo;re doing that full tornado move. They\u0026rsquo;re like flopping around, jumping up high, doing double jumps. And again, people are really excited until someone starts to get hurt.\nAnd you see that security has been hunting for this person too who\u0026rsquo;s like causing this problem? But we now know that they\u0026rsquo;re using costumes trying to get away. I have the revelation that if they\u0026rsquo;re in that costume, they\u0026rsquo;re probably not getting much sunlight. So they\u0026rsquo;re not going to stick to that costume for very long. They will be taking it off. But if they\u0026rsquo;re learning to hide in that way, they might find a simpler costume, a better wig or whatever, rather than a full body Crash Bandicoot mascot suit, and so if we can\u0026rsquo;t find Crash– which we see is in another hotel, so we\u0026rsquo;re running outside, into the crowds of people, trying to move through all of these cool costumes as we try to find our way to the Hilton or whatever– the Marriott, maybe– that in the… that somewhere in this crowd, we\u0026rsquo;re either looking for a Crash Bandicoot or a Joey or a Joey that has changed costumes. And the video that we saw of that sudden cartoonish violence was in the Marriott, so we\u0026rsquo;re heading there immediately. And we found it fast because I\u0026rsquo;ve been keeping a close eye on the tags, the DragonCon tags on every social media platform. I\u0026rsquo;m a whiz with my phone.\nSo with that information, this folklore or rumours and this info on a crime they committed, which again is that they have committed some violence as Crash Bandicoot causing the security to start hunting for them, we have all the information we need to build a plan. Everything is moving into place. The security is maybe going to help us here.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re in a costume that is blocking out their energy level for the moment as they try to move through space. They might not even be as aware of their battery limitation as I am, thanks to my information from the future. And we have a rough location that is very immediate. So Zyll and Charlie are rushing their way over to the Marriott to try to find Joey One.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah, and I\u0026rsquo;m showcasing multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together.\nToday we\u0026rsquo;re finishing our games of Accomplice, a role-playing game about researching the unknown by Michael Klamerus. With me again are Tomas Gimenez Rioja and Caleb Zane Huett. Get yourself on the list to be notified of the Kickstarter launch for Magnolia: City of Marvels, a systemless setting of art, punk, and rebellion, and check out the physical edition of Triangle Agency, a role-playing game of paranormal investigation and corporate horror. All of the links are in the episode description.\nLast episode, we finished up the research phase, so we\u0026rsquo;re sliding into the final two phases, or perhaps more accurately, the final phase which has two parts, the plan and the ending. The end of your story in Accomplice is essentially predefined, in that the game notes that your plan for sure works: whatever it was that you came up with during the research phase does the job. But on top of that, you get a prompt to define a complication that occurred as you enacted it. I generally bristle at prescribed narratives in games, but if they\u0026rsquo;re really well implemented, as I think this one is, they\u0026rsquo;re fantastic. In Accomplice, I think that it is really genre savvy? The drama in a monster-of-the-week rarely comes from a failure to defeat the evil, but from whatever happened while you\u0026rsquo;re doing it, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s great, and I think the prompts give you a lot of room to still have narrative consequences from anything else that you\u0026rsquo;ve explored in the course of your game.\nAs for the rest of the mechanics, honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to kick back and let Caleb tell you how it works, because he pretty much handled it in his recording.\nGAME: THE PLAN SATAH: So now it\u0026rsquo;s time to devise the plan.\nTOMAS: Now we need a plan.\nCALEB: And now we enter into the plan. So the plan I have not done before. The research I had gotten a little practice with, so I was going into it pretty flowy. The plan I have not even really read. So let\u0026rsquo;s read that together.\n“When you are done with your research, you will devise a plan for you and your partner to execute to defeat the creature. Describe all the aspects of your plan. What is your plan to defeat your foe? Where and when is the trap happening? And how confident does your partner feel about the trap?”\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s my thought. Our plan is to get to them in the Marriott and find them while they\u0026rsquo;re still in this Crash Bandicoot costume, using the chaos of the injury they\u0026rsquo;ve done to someone by spin-attacking them after having seen Crash Bandicoot online– like they saw Crash Bandicoot and their internal database scanned and figured out who Crash Bandicoot is– and they attacked someone who had a big weapon on them.\nWe want to use the approach of actual security pinning them in a particular place, and the goop we got from our alien in the previous episode that typically disrupts robots, but in this case we\u0026rsquo;re hoping will gum up the suit such that they can\u0026rsquo;t escape from the Crash Bandicoot suit and are stuck inside of it until they run out of power.\nSo I am sending– I\u0026rsquo;m here to help and I\u0026rsquo;m here to help organise like where we\u0026rsquo;re going and what location we\u0026rsquo;re going to be in, how to point Zyll at the target, but Zyll is going to be using the goop that we have to gum up the works by firing it at them at the right time and is going to be putting themselves in harm\u0026rsquo;s way, diving into danger and potentially exposing themselves as a problem as security approaches. So they might get spin-kicked by Crash Bandicoot, they might be captured by security and themselves kicked out of the convention or gotten– uh, put into trouble. And the thing that we\u0026rsquo;re using to fire this goop looks kind of like a gun. So there is some added risk there of something that actually does kind of look like a weapon being in DragonCon, that\u0026rsquo;s not just a toy weapon. But since it is like a sci-fi thing, since it\u0026rsquo;s an alien thing, maybe it looks like a weird– people would assume looking at it that maybe it was like a Doctor Who prop, but it is like real space metal. They have different elements up there. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the future.\nMy partner feels very confident about the trap because they feel confident about everything. They’re… they believe me, they trust me, and they have never failed at anything in their lives, so they\u0026rsquo;re not nervous.\nTOMAS: To find this entity of the dark, I\u0026rsquo;ve chatted with Jorge in ways for us to capture the doppelganger, and we have developed a plan. It involves using a carnival. A carnival is a place where many people meet, so the doppelganger may feel cocky about meeting us there– or Jorge at least. Jorge will be going alone, as he has written within the newspapers in code for Morpher to meet him in the Parque de la Costa: a carnival, a place where a house of mirrors is located. We\u0026rsquo;re going to be trapping Morpher there. We will be going on plain daylight. We are using two advantages that the doppelganger has decided to show.\nJorge has managed to talk with the people there at the park, at this carnival, in order to set on this day a theme around it. All Nordic, all Norse. We are using Odin, Thor, Loki, all the popular Norse gods, Vikings as well. Everything is going to use that theme in order to have the doppelganger feel comfortable in there. They will think that they will be able to escape easily if needed, even though they will be located within daylight and at the house of mirrors.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where Jorge will meet to avenge his wife Rosa. It may be difficult to find a way in or out of the house of mirrors– it is a maze, after all– but Jorge has already planned for this. He has studied the way the mirrors are located and how to easily escape. Jorge is excellent at what he does. He has memorized the whole place.\nWhen Jorge finds the doppelganger in there, they are surely going to try to escape after being shown. They surely want to laugh off at the face of Jorge after what he has done. But even if he manages to escape, all the people at the carnival will be moved to another location, on the other corner from the carnival. They are going to be gifting many sorts of prizes. This is going to be a big investment.\nNow, where and when is the trap happening? We have already said so, at the maze, at the house of mirrors within the Parque de la Costa there in Buenos Aires.\nHow confident does your partner feel about the trap? I like to think that he is confident. However, I am sure he is terrified of this entity, even though he may have a never-ending anger against them. Jorge has never managed to accept Rosa\u0026rsquo;s death. He can\u0026rsquo;t fail at this.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s answer some questions. “What is your plan to defeat your foe?” That\u0026rsquo;s a great question.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s go inside the house. Like, you know, we’re like– obviously there\u0026rsquo;s a reason that the, um– there’s a reason that no one’s ever allowed inside the house. It must be where… there must be weaknesses in there or something. So, yeah, I think in a lot of ways that’s, uh– the plan is get inside the house, figure it out from there? Which isn\u0026rsquo;t an amazing plan, when it comes to… planning. But I think that\u0026rsquo;s what it is.\nMaybe I can figure out a little bit more about what our plan is and how to do that… I think it has to be something that separates us because to continue to play into some of the themes that this game is setting up, I think that I can\u0026rsquo;t go in with the hero.\nOh, I host like a… gala for the PTA, or a fundraiser or something? Like, I’m like– I mean it would have already had to be planned, but— so, we know that the PTA elections are next week. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, “There\u0026rsquo;s a fundraiser event at the gallery tonight and we know that everybody who\u0026rsquo;s running for PTA will be schmoozing at that event. So I\u0026rsquo;m just going to make sure that I keep Brenda occupied and while she\u0026rsquo;s there, you go into the house.” Which is an alien. As we know.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where we have to set it up– like normally that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily be a schmoozing event, but I make sure to drop hints to all– like, it’s, you know, I go to every single person who\u0026rsquo;s running for that same position and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “What are your plans for this weekend? Oh yeah, I know I\u0026rsquo;m running this one event. I know that Brenda was really excited to be there so she can talk to all the constituents, ha ha ha ha.” And they\u0026rsquo;re like, “You know, that was also– I was hoping that I could make it. And you know, I really should just prioritize it.” And I go to each one of them and use one of the other\u0026rsquo;s names like, “Oh, um,”\u0026hellip; again, names. I was like, come up with just a classic suburban mom name and I– Electra. You know? Whatever.\nI social maneuver all of the people who are running for the PTA to be at this fundraising event so that we can distract them.\nI realized that I\u0026rsquo;ve established this person as like a suburban mom, but no kids? But I guess that makes sense– if we\u0026rsquo;re like college age, then she\u0026rsquo;s also like, “Yeah, my kid\u0026rsquo;s off at university or whatever.”\n“How confident does your partner feel about the trap?”\nI\u0026rsquo;m thinking through this cause it could go two ways. Again, multiple ways, but the two main ways are like, they\u0026rsquo;re not confident cause they\u0026rsquo;ve been rusty this whole time, you know? And they\u0026rsquo;re like, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how to do this. There\u0026rsquo;s also like, oh shit, I\u0026rsquo;m back to the old me, but excited tone, you know? Aw shit, back to the old me!\nSo like, I think there\u0026rsquo;s part of them, you know, we, we have a conversation as we\u0026rsquo;re setting up for the fundraising event. Like the hero is helping me just unstack chairs and put them out and put tablecloths on the little tables and whatever. And we, we have sort of, we\u0026rsquo;re having an idle conversation and then it turns into them… I think for the first time, this is the first time that they admit, like. Things haven\u0026rsquo;t been perfect away at college. And that like they\u0026rsquo;re really happy, but also like sometimes they just feel so outside of it because they\u0026rsquo;ve had all these experiences that nobody else can understand. You know? No one else had a supernatural task force that kept saving the world as a child. And so sometimes like they do just like, they miss being around people who understand them, like understand those deep parts of them. And they like apologize for any resistance that they showed during this process, you know?\nLike they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Sorry if I got in the way or wasn\u0026rsquo;t cooperating. I was– I was scared to– like I was scared that doing this would erase growth that I\u0026rsquo;ve had while I\u0026rsquo;ve been away from it. And I just wanted to deny that it was ever part of my life because it is something that like, causes pain and alienation in the life that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to create. I wanted to deny that it\u0026rsquo;s part of me. But it is part of me. And, and it feels good. It feels good to acknowledge that again, to be somewhere where I can\u0026ndash;\n[Sound of a door flying open and a cat meowing insistently]\nHi Garold. How did you do that, buddy? I thought that was closed.\n[Chair shifting as Satah sits back down]\nUm, yeah, “It, it, it feels good. It feels good to do this and to, to, to do it as the person I am now, the person that I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to be in my time away from it.”\nAnd so I think they feel good. They feel really confident. They\u0026rsquo;re like, “We\u0026rsquo;ve gotten at it worse before, you know, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not even a big deal.” And I sort of, you know, chuckle again, kind of ruefully and warily. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Well, you should know not to say that. Never say that it\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal.” And they laugh. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s just this like… quiet confidence about them? And I think for the first time, my character like, doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel disconnected in that moment? Like they, I, I, I see something that is new in this person and that\u0026rsquo;s– that\u0026rsquo;s been something that has been really scary for me. And I think for the first time here, I just feel like pride. Where I\u0026rsquo;m like, oh, this person I love might not be that exact person, but I love the person that they\u0026rsquo;re becoming too. And that\u0026rsquo;s exciting.\nSo they\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about it. They\u0026rsquo;re ready to go into the house that’s an alien.\nCALEB: My plan succeeds and my foe is defeated, but something unexpected occurs. Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s draw a card for prompt. A 10 of diamonds. The 10: “while acting out your plan, you discover a huge flaw, but still succeed with no complications. What was the flaw and how did you luck out?”\nOkay. I think– I think there\u0026rsquo;s two flaws. The first one is that Zyll is still in the Black Rose outfit with the giant fake ax. And instead of being able to sneak up on this android, when he comes up, the android Joey One sees his fake ax and she immediately turns to him as a target. So instead of just being like a member of the crowd watching as the security chases this Crash Bandicoot so they can fire goop into the suit and seal it, as they approach their acts gets scanned by Joey One and she turns directly to him and starts attacking him.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s super strong. Zyll is quick and fast, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually have a lot of experience manipulating these alien devices anyway. So instead of having the time to like sit and focus and aim well, he– his gun gets like knocked out of his hands– the alien gun– his sword gets snapped in half and destroyed and he gets like knocked to the side, having to sort of try to sort of like try to catch his breath and get back in place to try to stop this android.\nLuckily, I\u0026rsquo;m nearby. I\u0026rsquo;m going to let myself be the hero here as Charlie. And the alien gun gets knocked out of Zyll\u0026rsquo;s hand, slides across the hotel carpet and stops by my feet. I pick it up. Zyll realizes that if I\u0026rsquo;m going to successfully do this– I\u0026rsquo;m not a good shot. I don\u0026rsquo;t have practice like this. I didn\u0026rsquo;t come from the post-apocalyptic future where I know how to use, you know, firearms well. He\u0026rsquo;s going to have to distract Crash Bandicoot Joey One. And so he dives back into a really dangerous zone, starts dodging around, getting their attention to keep them stuck there for the moment as I, shaky hands, narrowed eyes, fire with intense recoil at Joey One and this dark tech– techie like um, chromatic black goop– I say chromatic, I\u0026rsquo;m meaning opalescent. Opalescent black goop that has like big sort of green and purple in it when you look at it in the light– fires at the suit and immediately begins like hunting around it, looking a little Venom-y as it finds the cracks and crevices, fills them in and makes the whole suit sealed around the android, cutting off even the small amounts of sunlight they would be getting from things like the eye holes.\nSo we know that they don\u0026rsquo;t have power and they\u0026rsquo;re going to begin losing power soon. However, security is coming at us. They\u0026rsquo;ve seen me fire a weapon. They\u0026rsquo;ve seen a fight break out with Zyll. And so we have to figure out a way to get this android out of there before they get captured by security, because we want to stop them and potentially reprogram them and become friends with them and have them join our team. But if security finds them, the android is going to get scooped back up by their creator. They\u0026rsquo;re going to refine what they\u0026rsquo;ve already done to Joey One. Joey One might escape again and eventually become an evil tyrant. So we have to try to stop that, and maybe, long term, work with Joey One on taking down the company before they make more Joeys that could also themselves become the tyrants. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of a fun twist! If we think it\u0026rsquo;s Joey that\u0026rsquo;s the evil one, but really, the evil one is still coming later and Joey is able to help us because we\u0026rsquo;ve given her a chance to learn how to be a person.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t get the injury complication, but I think if I was doing this episode myself, there would be. I think Zyll would break an arm or something. I think we would be dealing with a lot of risk being up close to this kind of automatically violent robot.\nAnd so, um… we\u0026hellip; how do we get out of this?\nWe lure them away. Zyll runs off with the robot while I intercept security. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, “I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry! This was supposed to be a prop! It was just goop! I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to do that!” And I make a big deal out of how I\u0026rsquo;m turning myself in to distract them from being able to get to Joey One while Zyll lures Joey One away from the crowds, takes them outside and goes on like a longer chase until the lack of sunlight means that her battery is draining quickly. And when she loses a significant amount of power, Zyll is able to pick her up, put her in a car with us that we brought at a particular parking deck– or maybe he steals a car briefly– and take her back to our\u0026hellip; to my house, probably because he\u0026rsquo;s from the future, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a house. Take her back to my house and, uh, we will figure out how to help her from there.\nMeanwhile, I get in trouble, Zyll gets a broken arm, and I\u0026rsquo;m permanently banned from DragonCon forever.\nTOMAS: “Your plan succeeds and your foe is defeated, but something unexpected occurs. Draw a card for a prompt.”\nThis is a 10 of diamonds. “While acting out your plan, you discover a huge flaw, but still succeed with no complications. What was the flaw and how did you luck out?”\nOkay, we are going to say that even though we planned all of this excellently, we didn\u0026rsquo;t expect three children will still be within the maze by the time everyone else has moved to the other corner from the park. These didn\u0026rsquo;t find a way out in time and were still trapped within the maze. Jorge was close to shooting one of these kids, but when he noticed that more than one person was within the maze, he noticed that the plan wasn\u0026rsquo;t going according to what we had expected, which meant that the doppelganger, Morpher, had an advantage here. They could hide in an easier manner.\nWe just needed Jorge to find the kid who didn\u0026rsquo;t actually look like the reflection. The never-ending anger caused Jorge to shoot these mirrors. And… no kid was harmed; they all just laid there on the ground, terrified by the sound of the shot that occurred. And within the many fragments of these mirrors, Jorge was able to discern the figure of the doppelganger was not looking like the kid that thee looked like.\nJorge didn\u0026rsquo;t flinch. Jorge didn\u0026rsquo;t think for a single second more. Bang. The gooish entity dissolved into pure goo there in the maze.\nParts of the earnings from the many wealthy that paid Jorge for this went into therapy for these two kids that were left. But we didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to find the doppelganger… we killed them. And that is how we approach the ending.\nSATAH: “Your plan succeeds and your foe is defeated, but something unexpected occurs. Draw a card for a prompt.”\nKing. “Victory came more easily than you thought it would. How did you over prepare?” Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s so funny.\nI mean, the hero is like kitted up. You know, they\u0026rsquo;re like ready for a fight. They\u0026rsquo;ve got our hacker friend on speed dial, whatever. And they\u0026rsquo;re like, this could be super dangerous. And then they walk in… and an alarm starts going off. Not like a burglar alarm, but like a proximity alarm. And they\u0026rsquo;ve set off some sort of automatic retreat. Like they go in and it\u0026rsquo;s just like– in a way that I bet is actually budget concerns, so that we only see one room of the house because it\u0026rsquo;s like weird, weird biotech shit, you know? And we see that and the hero is looking around and the door in front of them, to get deeper into the house, as they reach for it disappears. It just [Awful slurping sound] slurps back into the wall and red lights start flashing and… and it leaves. It’s like, “Automatic, whatever, retreat enabled. You have 10 seconds to get out of here before I leave the planet.”\nAnd the hero had been ready for a fight and is bewildered, steps out… and the house leaves. It folds up into that true form we saw in that zine from the 30s and it just leaves. It shoots up into the atmosphere. At least for a while, you know– I bet it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where like maybe they\u0026rsquo;d have to, maybe this is just like a lizard dropping its tail off. No, that\u0026rsquo;s not an appropriate metaphor at all– simile at all. It’s– it might just be a tactical retreat. But it is a retreat. And the house that is an alien is gone.\nAnd I think it, you know, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take Brenda with it. Brenda\u0026rsquo;s with me and she looks up in panic at one point and notices me watching her and suddenly realizes that I know. And I think, to figure out more about what that means, let\u0026rsquo;s go into the ending!\nGAME: THE ENDING CALEB: Some big sacrifices. I can never return to DragonCon, we broke an arm, we have to deal with Crash Bandicoot living in our house and the dangers of a new android. But we also maybe made a friend, if we can help her understand the world that she\u0026rsquo;s in, and protect her from the company that built her. And ultimately, she\u0026rsquo;s a valuable and powerful ally to stop the apocalyptic future from coming.\nAnd that is the plan. Next up, we go into the end.\nTOMAS: Morpher is dead. Jorge Pugnales managed to get his revenge on the death of Rosa Martinez, as well as many other wealthy individuals from the city of Buenos Aires and possibly from many other sections from the world. This doppelganger that has been living for centuries, met their doom. And now we get to the ending.\n“Once the evil has been defeated, answer the following questions. What have you learned about the world?” We learned that the president from Argentina was actually hidden deep within a bunker in the middle of the country. We had to search for two whole weeks, two whole weeks that we had to hide the people from Argentina that the president was not to be seen, and possibly dead. Several people disappeared as well, with no trace. We suspect that these may have been victims from Morpher. That Morpher may have infiltrated and taken their place.\nD.H. Kellard, the author of the book, is still there. So we are still suspecting that there may be another doppelganger, maybe one that wanted to help us. We are not sure of that.\nCALEB: Hooray! The evil is defeated, or perhaps brought into the fold, based on how the following episodes go. We got to see DragonCon in all its glory, we had extras dressed up, best day of their lives, filmed on location, made it an event, and soon the episode of this sci-fi TV show will appear on screens everywhere.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the ramifications, what happens when we return home. “What have you learned about the world?” I think part of that is obvious. This is episode 2 or 3; I\u0026rsquo;ve learned with confidence that this stuff is not going to stop happening. There is a company out there making androids that are very dangerous and have lax security protocols around them, and that humanity has passed the point where robots can be people, and now one of them is my friend in my house, who I have to teach about the world. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve learned.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;ve also learned that nobody really recognized our.hack outfits while we were hanging out on the floor, which makes me feel like I\u0026rsquo;m getting old.\nSATAH: I just want to name the things I\u0026rsquo;m percolating on, that again I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to just kind of untangle to make this… obviously incredibly logical narrative make sense.\nThe most obvious being like, if other buildings in the town are also aliens, does that mean that no one has ever been in those buildings? If so, how did no one notice? But if not, why? And so I think that\u0026rsquo;s– I\u0026rsquo;m going to tie that into– the very first question is, “What have you learned about the world?”\nFirst of all, sometimes buildings are aliens. I\u0026rsquo;m going to write that down.\n[Typing noises]\nBecause that\u0026rsquo;s important.\nAnd I think this is like we get, you know, the end of episode lore dump. Uh. Oh. We\u0026rsquo;re brought into city hall… no. We\u0026rsquo;re at the gallery. Me and the hero. We\u0026rsquo;re at the gallery cleaning up after the fundraiser, which was last night. Or at the end of the night. Yeah, this is just the end of the night; the hero comes to the gallery and we\u0026rsquo;re cleaning up and we\u0026rsquo;re chatting. And we learn about this with Brenda! That\u0026rsquo;s what it is. Because I just am like, “Hey Brenda, stick around, like… we gotta talk.” And Brenda\u0026rsquo;s like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.”\nUm, and she\u0026rsquo;s helping us clean up, you know? Whatever. This is part of the role that she\u0026rsquo;s inhabited for the past while. And we\u0026rsquo;re asking, we\u0026rsquo;re like, “So is it true that these other buildings are also that species?”\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, “Yep.”\nAnd the hero does like a, “Well, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been inside that store and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like–” and sort of twists their face up.\nAnd Brenda laughs and she\u0026rsquo;s like, “Yeah, it takes time. They\u0026rsquo;re old. You need to acclimate.” Like young buildings– young buildings look goopy still. Young building aliens look goopy and older ones just look like buildings inside. They\u0026rsquo;ve had time. They need to ripen, you know, in some ways. And you know, she sort of like shakes her head mournfully at one point. And she was like, you know, “It was never going to be– the house was never going to be permanent.” And she has, you know, some alien name– some, some difficult to pronounce name for that alien, but, but, but gives, refers to it by name. Like s like, you know… “Gleep Glorp, uh, is, um, wanted to be a school.”\nOh, that\u0026rsquo;s what it is. It\u0026rsquo;s like the house was an adolescent and Brenda was trying to get onto the PTA in part so that she could shape the school to be in a form that the alien could take because that alien wanted to be a school. Maybe as a job?\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to decide how sinister this is. I think it\u0026rsquo;s ambiguous because it\u0026rsquo;s like, there is still manipulation being done here, but like… maybe, maybe this house that wanted to be a school wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to eat kids… but like, it\u0026rsquo;s still kind of weird to manipulate people? … In order to become the school.\nHmm. Yeah. You know, whatever.\nAnd so the, the, the direction I was going to go with this was that like government agents from the organization that our astronomer friend seems to be working for– the shadowy government organization comes to talk to us to like get information and stuff. But no, I, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to stick with us talkin’ with Brenda as we\u0026rsquo;re tearing down the fundraiser. We\u0026rsquo;re learning sometimes buildings are aliens. When they\u0026rsquo;re young, they look goopy inside. And then eventually they get older. They\u0026rsquo;re mature. And then they\u0026rsquo;re just buildings. And maybe they have an agenda. Maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s not what we\u0026rsquo;re going to learn this episode.\nTOMAS: “How\u0026rsquo;s your relationship with your partner changed?” After seeing Jorge managing to put an end to this entity, no matter the cost, left traumas on the minds of those poor kids. He has many vices. As I said, I worry and I still worry. My relationship with him has changed. Yes. I fought him to go to therapy. He\u0026rsquo;s busy with a psychiatrist at the moment. He\u0026rsquo;s taking medicaments and possibly getting better. His depression is being treated. His vices are trying to be put under control, going to several locations that can help him.\nCALEB: “How is your relationship with your partner changed?” I think during all of that action, you know, they got to see me fire the gun. They were like proud of me for being involved. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a newfound trust for each other. And while we were in these like this like kind of partners costume together, there was some romantic moments! There were some dramatic romantic moments. And could it be that I\u0026rsquo;m the one being saved from my boring life or from my present, instead of them who\u0026rsquo;s been saved from their future? It\u0026rsquo;s possible. It\u0026rsquo;s possible.\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t learn much about Charlie, but I think, uh… a… this is a level of risk that he has not undergone.\nSATAH: “Has your relationship with your partner changed?” Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s gotten stronger. And I think that everything we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about here, like, it very much feels like it was probably the first episode. The first– these were the first days of summer.\nWhy is Brenda campaigning for– I don\u0026rsquo;t know when PTA elections happen. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it.\n[Laughing]\nAnd so we\u0026rsquo;re like– it\u0026rsquo;s gotten stronger and we you also see us like acknowledging that maybe summer is going to be a little wacky now that the hero is back in town, and we\u0026rsquo;re back on a television show. We don\u0026rsquo;t say that, but it is what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s gotten– we\u0026rsquo;re bonding. We\u0026rsquo;re recognizing– we\u0026rsquo;re learning how to know each other as something closer to adults rather than as kids.\nCALEB: “And what do you plan to do now that your opponent has been defeated?” Well, that one is easy and obvious. They are going to become a main cast member. We have a pop star in our show. They are a B or C list celebrity, but they are in the show now, playing as themselves, wearing a variety of costumes. On episodes where they\u0026rsquo;re not able to make it because of scheduling conflict, the android wears a disguise or we replace them with a different faceplate and allow them to move on being the same character.\nWe help talk them through the world that they live in and what\u0026rsquo;s happened to them. And they decide pretty shortly after that they want to stop the company from making more that were going to go evil, and want time to understand who they are and what the ramifications of their existence is before a bunch of them are unleashed on the world. I think there might be some nefarious secrets about how they\u0026rsquo;ve been built, too, that they might be attempting to avoid for future ones? Like maybe they really do have some wild weapons technology in them that was not supposed to be there? Or was only there as a secret that they know to be worried about in the future.\nBut we\u0026rsquo;re going to become a trio. We’re going to be working together to save the day from the evil future and we are hoping that in the span of however many seasons we can get paid to produce, we can make the future a safe place, and perhaps even better of a world than the one that we are already in. Rather than obscenely, terribly worse Age of Apocalypse style.\nTOMAS: “What do you plan to do now that your opponent has been defeated?” As of me, I am just a librarian and Jorge doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be going to go after these entities any longer.\nThere is a high probability of many more doppelgangers in the confines of the world. People think they need a hero. Nah. They just need someone to take care of this mess before it turns into a bigger one without anyone else noticing. Me, Tomas. I will take that role. And that\u0026rsquo;s how we close this chapter.\n[Book closing]\nSATAH: “What do you plan to do now that your opponent has been defeated?” We\u0026rsquo;re relaxing. We\u0026rsquo;re chilling. It\u0026rsquo;s summer. This isn\u0026rsquo;t going to happen again; I lied. Summer isn\u0026rsquo;t– summer isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be weird now that the hero’s back in town. No, we know that it\u0026rsquo;s going to be weird, but we are just going to like– we want to just hang out and I think the other thing that this is, is that we\u0026rsquo;re like, “Hey Brenda, what\u0026rsquo;s your plan? Your house… your house left. Are you good? Are you going to die? Like what\u0026rsquo;s happening?”\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, “I don\u0026rsquo;t know. We\u0026rsquo;ve never– this has never happened before, like, we\u0026rsquo;ve never left separately? Because usually people try to chase me out of town, you know, or they try to chase the drone out of town and they don\u0026rsquo;t go inside the house.” And so like the drone has the opportunity to like escape into the house and then they leave together or whatever. So this has never happened before. So it\u0026rsquo;s unprecedented.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re like, “Okay, well, if you, if, if you don\u0026rsquo;t do weird power grabs and stuff… do you want to be part of our supernatural fighting team?” I think is probably ultimately the thing. Maybe as a minor character, but I think like Brenda, you know, resigns from the campaign trail for the PTA and starts working at the gallery with me? And she\u0026rsquo;ll be around. That\u0026rsquo;s– she\u0026rsquo;ll be our new cool alien consultant.\nBut, uh, yeah, our plan is, we have to figure out how Brenda can have a life now that the house that created her is no longer on the planet.\n[Typing as they talk] Help Brenda integrate into a more honest life and… HAGS. Have a good summer.\nCALEB: I kind of wish I had this show now.

I am your host, Satah, and I am aiming to showcase multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together!\nThis is episode 1 of Unplugged Survivor, a game by We Are Heroes Productions and the Tabletop for the End of the World podcast. Unplugged Survivor is a consecutive journaling game about waking up from a corporate VR prison charmingly called True Reality, finding yourself in a post-apocalyptic hellscape, and keeping a diary about it. The main game loop is pulling cards and rolling a d6 to get a prompt for your next journal entry. Each face card is an omen: Kings and Aces are ominous, Jacks and Queens are hopeful. And your character\u0026rsquo;s ending is determined by which category you pull three of first. When your character meets whatever that ending is, their entries are passed along to the next player in hopes that their character will be able to learn something from your journey to carry in theirs.\nI chose this game because I love cyberpunk dystopic bullshit and I love the cumulative format. Putting the time into a full playthrough of this and then just handing it off to the next player to keep building on is a beautiful, bizarre, and intimate experience for me that demands a fantastic payout for the amount of trust invested– and oh boy did my guests meet that demand! I\u0026rsquo;m so excited for you to hear how this develops.\nThough, speaking of guests, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to meet them immediately, you\u0026rsquo;re just going to hang out with me for a little while. But they are HappyBirthday, whose work you can find at gm36.itch.io, and Darling Demon Eclipse, whose work you can find at eclipse.gay. You should particularly check out her recent sexy duet sci-fi romance TTRPG, Biotrophication.\nBefore we get started, I want to note that there are two words for forces in the game that I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise are just real Russian words. They should sound like\nPRONUNCIATION GUIDE CLIP: потреблять\nSATAH: and\nPRONUNCIATION GUIDE CLIP: дурак.\nSATAH: That is absolutely not how they sound when I say them. But my character also mispronounces some stuff like names just because it\u0026rsquo;s been so long since our current era that the pronunciations are sort of lost to time… so feel free to accept that as an explanation alongside my apologies.\nAnd with that, let\u0026rsquo;s hop into character creation and start our dystopic diary.\nGAME SATAH: [Quietly, over the sound of shuffling cards] Absolutely classic… forgot to take the jokers out…\nSo the first thing we do in character creation is choose three personality traits: a positive personality trait, neutral personality trait, and a negative personality trait. I… don\u0026rsquo;t like choosing things. I love randomness, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to go to a random letter generator. Normally I\u0026rsquo;d go to, like, a random adjective generator, but there is a list, so I am going to choose from the list, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to do it in a guided way.\nSo for my positive personality trait, got the letter P. What P words are here? Positive P words. “Perceptive, personable, purposeful.” Interesting. I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with “perceptive” just because that jumps out to me the most as like a character that is interesting to write from the perspective of?\nNeutral personality trait. The random letter I got is L. The L words on this list… ooh, the L words… the L words on this list. Ah. Immediately foiled in my plan. This one\u0026rsquo;s not quite as thorough. There are no L words. What\u0026rsquo;s closest? M. “Mellow” or “moralistic.” Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s very funny. I don\u0026rsquo;t, I don\u0026rsquo;t– mm. I was going to say that I\u0026rsquo;m not drawn to moralistic because I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily want to play or write that type of character at the moment, but the phrasing of this game, like the phrasing of this section as “before you\u0026rsquo;re unplugged”– I think, I think it\u0026rsquo;s just supposed to be like, this is character creation, but it does make me think like maybe I\u0026rsquo;ve changed a little bit?\nYeah, ultimately I think– so, mellow doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a lot for me, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with moralistic and I feel like maybe that has to do with, you know, the situation that I find myself in.\nNegative personality trait… D. D words in the negative personality traits. “Deceitful, dependent, desperate, destructive, disorganised, disturbing.” Huh. “Disorganized” is so funny, like in comparison to some of these other very intense negative personality traits.\nI guess “moralistic” and “deceitful” is a very fun combination because it\u0026rsquo;s like, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think lying is wrong, or I think that lying is worth it to do whatever the thing I consider important is? Which is great.\nSo the three character traits I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen, which will be crossed off for everyone else are perceptive, moralistic, and deceitful.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m going to answer the “What\u0026rsquo;s your story?” questions. This is a Matrix situation, right? Yeah.\nWho were you when you were plugged in? Hmm. Not a lot of guidance here, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to look for a random profession generator… keep trying to find ones that aren\u0026rsquo;t claiming to be generative AI… great.\nThe suggestions it gave me are “shoemaker, plumber, typist, train driver, laborer, advertising executive,” uh, “croupier,” I know that word, but I forget what it is. It\u0026rsquo;s not “croup-ee-ay”, is it? Croupier. Ah, somebody who works at a gaming table. That\u0026rsquo;s me right now! “Disc jockey, leaflet distributor, and courier.” Ooh. Immediately drawn to disc jockey. The idea that in the quote unquote matrix, I was on the radio, so essentially like an essential part of the internal propaganda machine is definitely very appealing to me.\n“How long have you been unplugged?” Ooh, a while, I think. It has to be recent enough that there\u0026rsquo;s a reason that I\u0026rsquo;m starting this journal, though– I actually, oh, it\u0026rsquo;s so funny. I\u0026rsquo;ve, I\u0026rsquo;ve, I\u0026rsquo;ve been considering– I guess subconsciously, I must have been thinking about this– when I was planning this episode, I was thinking about using a framework of a post-apocalyptic radio station and I\u0026rsquo;ve, I\u0026rsquo;ve walked right, I\u0026rsquo;ve walked myself right into that concept.\nSo I think what it is… I\u0026rsquo;ve been sort of wandering and the thing that has changed, the reason that I\u0026rsquo;m starting this journal, this record, is just that forever, for like ages, I have been– somebody offered me a job working at the radio station and I was like, absolutely not, like, like that, that is, that is like a part of me that was used as a tool, right? Um, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that again. And I think just slowly, like, you know, I started doing some sort of mechanical or technical work at the station. Like I was like, I can do repairs. I learned all this stuff. Uh, you know, at least I thought I did. Memory\u0026rsquo;s funny like that, right? Like it\u0026rsquo;s like, well, I remember learning all of this stuff. Those memories were implanted, but I do have that knowledge. So I was just like, you know, helping out with the electronics, keeping the station on the air and then something happened– maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out in my first entry– that was like, okay, yes, I will do this. I will be on the air. I will be part of you. You know, I\u0026rsquo;ve had like a little bit of a whole journey before this even happened.\nSo, “How long have you been unplugged?” I\u0026rsquo;m going to say one year. Is that crazy? I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to do a year, which means the next question of “Have you regained some strength before starting your journal or you fresh out?” is, yeah.\n“Are your loved ones still plugged in? Are they still alive?” Hmm. So I think it\u0026rsquo;s complicated. I think that when I was plugged in, I was very much a like, you know, the dad who\u0026rsquo;s going to learn a lesson in the Christmas movie? Very career focused. And so I don\u0026rsquo;t think I had a lot of loved ones on the inside because that was just easier. So I just, you know, was very married to my career. And I think one of the first things that happened when I woke up was remembering like, oh, I did have people, you know, before I got plugged in. And I think they are long gone? Not exactly sure why yet, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing of like waking up and being like, oh, I thought I was alone. I\u0026rsquo;m not alone. Ahh… yeah, actually, I am. I am alone.\nOh, and I think just to like make sure that I\u0026rsquo;m playing in the right realm of the game, because it does really want, it wants you a little bit, it seems like to have been woken up recently? I think a part of the thing is that I left the city? Like I woke up, you know, in the city core and I just, everything was too much and I just like went out into the wastes. Um, so I\u0026rsquo;m– I’m recently returned to the city itself. And so there is stuff that is still like fresh and new because I just kind of like wandered off and was a hermit in the radioactive barons or whatever for a year, trying to figure some stuff out.\nSo with some of that starting to be figured out, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to do the pull for my first journal entry because I think it\u0026rsquo;s sort of in the process of writing my introductory entry I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ll find more of the character. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to shuffle these again, draw a card and roll a d6.\nOoh, okay. Got the nine of diamonds and a six. So diamonds with a six: “betrayal.” Oh my goodness. Okay. So the emotion that is– that I\u0026rsquo;m feeling as I write is betrayal and nine, the value nine is “surprise help.” Okay. That\u0026rsquo;s a really interesting combination.\nThe first two things that come to mind are of course, like I was betrayed in some way and then the surprise help was somebody helping me recover from the betrayal. But the other thing that it could be is that the betrayal is the help, or the help is the betrayal.\nWhat are my traits? Perceptive, moralistic and deceitful. Yeah.\nSo I think– oh, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m not a host yet. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m calling into the radio station? Hmm. No, I think it has to be something about– so I\u0026rsquo;m feeling betrayed by– I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to lean into like, I\u0026rsquo;m feeling betrayed, but by somebody who helped me. Um, the help is the betrayal. So I\u0026rsquo;m sort of like, I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be me having landed back in the station, having landed in the station doing a show, my first show. And it is like this begrudging acceptance that I\u0026rsquo;m doing the right thing.\nSo I think, I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be that I was sort of shoved in front of the mic. Uh, like it\u0026rsquo;s like, it\u0026rsquo;s a, you know, “Hey, by the way, so and so called out sick.” And I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Oh shit, well, what are you going to do for the show?” And they\u0026rsquo;re like, “I actually have a great idea. Can I show you?” And I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Yeah.” And they pull me into the studio and they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Look over there.” And I look and they walk out and they shut the door and they do the classic, you know, silent and five, four, point for three, point for two, point with one, light goes on. We\u0026rsquo;re live.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to go and write my first ever– my first moments hosting this, this radio show. Yeah.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): Good evening, Duraki. You\u0026rsquo;re listening to Doom FM, your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news. Don\u0026rsquo;t touch that dial. Don\u0026rsquo;t caress that panic button. I know my voice might be unsettlingly familiar to some of you, but I promise you\u0026rsquo;re still in the real-real.\nI know that sinking feeling too, listener. You miss a step going down the stairs or something isn\u0026rsquo;t where you swore you left it or a wild dog looks at you for a little too long and you just… wonder. If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, you do it less and less, but you do it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s unnerving. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it? In retrospect, the things our brains could just smooth over– the badly coded neighbour who always greeted you with the exact same intonation, the way food fell apart on your tongue, dissolving like a cheap streamer eaten on a dare at a birthday party. General anaesthesia at every single doctor\u0026rsquo;s appointment. Remember getting knocked out just to have your blood pressure taken? Why didn\u0026rsquo;t they just come up with a better lie?\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m not here to do Potrebylat survivor stand up. I’m not that kind of hack. I\u0026rsquo;m the kind of hack who… I\u0026rsquo;m here to… well. Still trying to figure that out, if I\u0026rsquo;m honest. I left for a while, you know. It\u0026rsquo;s a rough kind of freedom out there in the wastes for sure, but it is a freedom. But here I am, Duraki, holed up in a studio in a bunker, one of many studios in one of many bunkers, breathing onto a hot mic, trying to find that flow that refuses to give the air a chance to die, staring at Producer Dag’s shit eating grin behind the glass– oh, she gave me the finger, very professional environment here in the DOOM ROOM– speaking to you.\nSo I think that must be what pulled me back. There\u0026rsquo;s something I can do for you, Duraki. There\u0026rsquo;s something we can do for each other. We can carve out our own shitty freedom here under the searchlights, over the barbed wire, through the field and into the shelter, until one day it\u0026rsquo;s freedom without qualifications.\nFor that missed stare feeling, that heart-skipping “was that a glitch or just a human mistake thought,” when your clothes aren\u0026rsquo;t wearing as well the next day and your hair isn\u0026rsquo;t falling in quite the same way and you wonder just for a second, am I still..? Or did I? For all of that, we\u0026rsquo;ve got Nine Days with Absolutely (Story of a Girl).\nYou\u0026rsquo;re listening to Doom FM.\nSATAH: Okay, gotta pull the card for my second entry. Gotta grab the PDF again.\nAlright, my second card is five of clubs, roll a d6: a one. Okay. So journal entry two, clubs, clubs and a one is “loneliness.” Oh no. And a five for the value is “discovered knowledge about the world.” Oh my god. Yeah, okay.\nSo I feel like the thing that I should explore here is the thing that I um, you know, thought about in character creation, which is like, not having… people? Like I could discover something that– I could discover something that happened to someone? That, maybe that I knew before?\nIt could also be like somebody that I knew on the inside. I know I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of people that I was close to, but hmm. I want this to be a little, like, anecdote. So it\u0026rsquo;s something like, ooh, I just learned that something… isn\u0026rsquo;t true… on the outside. It\u0026rsquo;s something like… there\u0026rsquo;s a rule that I thought, ooh yeah, so it\u0026rsquo;s about like… something I was told, something I thought was true about radio? Um, that, hmm.\nNo, I\u0026rsquo;m going to totally go in a different direction. I found out that they\u0026rsquo;re still using my voice on the inside, that they\u0026rsquo;ve created like an AI model or whatever. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out more as I\u0026rsquo;m writing, but I\u0026rsquo;m trying to decide– maybe I mean, maybe my, the information I have isn\u0026rsquo;t clear. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out if like they have told people that I died or whatever they tell people when they get– about people who get unplugged, or if I\u0026rsquo;ve just been replaced seamlessly. I think that\u0026rsquo;s going to be it. I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be um, about learning that they\u0026rsquo;re still using my voice. That no one even noticed I was gone basically. Yeah, yeah, totally.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s that sense of loneliness of like, “No one even realized that I died.” I mean I didn\u0026rsquo;t die, but I kind of did and no one even knows. And that\u0026rsquo;s incredibly like– that\u0026rsquo;s sad. It\u0026rsquo;s like there\u0026rsquo;s no one to know, there was nobody in my life to even notice. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s also lonely because it gives me that like sense of alienation, of responsibility, of like– something I, something I, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember if I talked about before I went off to write, but something I really thought a lot about as I was writing was the sense of this person– oh no, I totally did. Of like this person having that responsibility? You know, of being like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is good? And I, as I was writing had like the, oh, um, some people might know this person\u0026rsquo;s voice and that might be really unpleasant for them in a lot of ways? And so I think it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like having that reverberation of being like, “Wait, I maybe shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing this,” or, “I\u0026rsquo;m having an experience that other people can\u0026rsquo;t understand.” Uh, yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll find it. I\u0026rsquo;ll find it in there.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): You\u0026rsquo;re listening to DOOM FM. Your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news. Forgive me if I falter my introductions this evening. I find myself wanting to speak very carefully. I have this urge to choose the words I say out loud with impossible precision in hopes that it will stop them from being recycled. Like if I can just avoid some assemblage of phonemes and syllables, I can keep my voice in my mouth. Like it can stay a secret that you and I alone carry, listeners. My tongue, your ears. My lips, your speakers. The electricity that translates the air I exhale into the air that touches the smallest bones of your body.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s nice to imagine that intimacy. I want to be comforted by being alone with you, listener. It\u0026rsquo;s late. Are you alone with me? Or are you listening with… a friend? A lover? You and another night owl perched on the same branch, listening to some other bird caw desperately up into the black for hours and hours?\nYou probably heard there was another batch of wake-ups today. Big power failure on the northeast grid popped a whole rack out into the real-real. Some of them survived. Some of them even got out. If you know how many, you should know enough to keep your mouth shut about it. Anyway, one of them– well, they got picked up by a fan of ours. Lucky thing. Still soaked in coolant, calming down in the passenger seat, even jamming a bit to our guaranteed interruption free power hour 9pm to 10pm every weeknight.\nBut then, as all hours do, that hour ended. And who\u0026rsquo;s the first interruption but the night host, yours truly? And that survivor… damn near clawed their way out of the truck window. Because I\u0026rsquo;m still… they\u0026rsquo;ve still got me on the radio. On the inside. They had enough of my voice to give it to some algorithm and now they don\u0026rsquo;t even have to give it the illusion of free will. They\u0026rsquo;ve got a host that can\u0026rsquo;t go off-script, because that\u0026rsquo;s all it is. And it\u0026rsquo;s got my fucking voice.\nSounds like they never even missed a show. No one knows I\u0026rsquo;m gone. No one has any reason to wonder. I was always at the studio anyway; probably just seems like the natural progression of things. I mean, if any of them have even thought about it. Maybe they haven\u0026rsquo;t.\nYeah. This is Kesha\u0026rsquo;s Fine Line off of Gag Order. Actually fuck it, it\u0026rsquo;s late. Let\u0026rsquo;s play the whole album.\nSATAH: Yay! I love to be incredibly lighthearted and chill in a video game. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what the next one is gonna be. I hope that it’s happier.\nGot a 10 of spades, uh, oh and roll a d6. Five. Okay. Five in spades is “vigor.” Feeling “vigor,” love that. Reacting to spades– or, sorry, ten. “Discovered resources.” Ooh okay.\nSomething invigorating. What does my character give a shit about finding? Is it something for them or is it something for their radio station? Because one possibility would be a bunch of music. Which I kind of love. Yeah, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s fun. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll figure out a thing that like… so I imagine the thing that this radio station is doing is like playing… like they\u0026rsquo;re digging up like physical media and playing it. And so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna think on it and find something that this person would be really excited to have. It\u0026rsquo;s very possible that it\u0026rsquo;s going to be Charli XCX\u0026rsquo;s BRAT because that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to obsessively lately and so it\u0026rsquo;s the easiest thing for me to imagine being very excited to find. But I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna ponder on that.\nIs there anything else that\u0026rsquo;s worth exploring here about like possibilities of what this could be? No, I think… I mean yes of course, but I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna stick with this. I like this. Let\u0026rsquo;s do something a little more chill.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): [Laughing] And you\u0026rsquo;re listening to DOOM FM. Your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news and tonight, all night, your number one source for some mysterious long dead bootlegger\u0026rsquo;s number one jams.\nFor anyone just tuning in, Producer Dag, the dagger herself, sharp blade and thick handle of the DOOM ROOM, once more overachieving in the line of duty, uncovered something fucking ridiculous. A folder of CDs, each one labelled by hand with a number, maybe an adjective if you\u0026rsquo;re lucky. They\u0026rsquo;re in this funny little fabric case clearly designed to hold the discs.\nAs always, we here at DOOM FM are deeply indebted to the paranoid weirdos who came before us. A toast! To all the paranoid weirdos. A toast– to not trusting data, to not trusting the cloud, to seeing the cataclysm coming and stuffing your DVDs into bubble wrap in reinforced storage lockers. DOOM FM would be nothing without you. We\u0026rsquo;d all be playing hoop and fucking stick. I\u0026rsquo;d be forced to try and play guitar– listeners. We all suffer enough.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got all our best people on sourcing the artists that we\u0026rsquo;ve been playing. Sorry to anyone who was relying on our reporting to uncover something that might save a life, but sometimes priorities have to shift. But for now, all I can tell you is that the song we just listened to was by… some fucking guy.\nComing up next, we\u0026rsquo;ve got… well, I\u0026rsquo;m just as excited to find out as you are. Maybe even more, if you\u0026rsquo;re sick of the songs we\u0026rsquo;ve gotten rotation, imagine how we feel.\nAfter that, we\u0026rsquo;ll have a call from an expert in the embarrassingly unscientific practice of handwriting analysis, trying to figure out more about the person who made these CDs by way of me describing the handwriting to her.\nAll here. All night. You, me, and some music bootlegger– may their presumably irradiated skeleton rest in peace and glory. On DOOM FM.\nSATAH: Oh, it was… it was really nice to write something a little more goofy.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what the next card brings. Got the seven of spades and I rolled a two. Spades two. What I\u0026rsquo;m feeling is “faith.” Interesting. And what I\u0026rsquo;m reacting to, a seven, is “usable technology found.” Huh.\nFaith. So obviously, there\u0026rsquo;s the religious aspect. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want to go there. I just don\u0026rsquo;t feel like exploring that. So it could be faith in humanity, faith in the cause… “usable technology.”\nSo I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be faith in humanity, sort of, or something like that. Because I think what it is, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be like technology that was gifted to the station? Or to somebody. Like it\u0026rsquo;s going to be… something was found and it was given to somebody else in a way that feels uncharacteristic of the wasteland.\nMm… I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do something as intense as a medical technology. Yeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be to the station. So– because I think it\u0026rsquo;s both going to be faith in humanity and also maybe faith in the mission. You know, kind of a like, oh yeah, still trying to convince themself that there\u0026rsquo;s a reason that they\u0026rsquo;re here and that they\u0026rsquo;re doing a good thing.\nSo what is it? What… what technology the radio station… not even need. Because I think I want it to be less than need. It\u0026rsquo;s not like a survival thing. It\u0026rsquo;s like a, oh, I thought you might find this helpful.\nOne thing I did set up in the last one is like they only have physical media. So I could go a direction of like, they found a hard drive that works, but I kind of, I don\u0026rsquo;t even want to open that up.\nThe thing I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about right now is like… something that lets the radio station see inside? Like to the people who are plugged in.\nThe other problem I\u0026rsquo;m having is like, there are interesting things where it\u0026rsquo;s like basically like a police scanner or whatever, but… there\u0026rsquo;s stuff that like, you know, the format of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing makes it strange? Like if somebody found like a working police scanner type of thing and gave it to the station, that would be great, but isn\u0026rsquo;t the type of thing that you\u0026rsquo;d want to talk about on air?\n[Gasp of thought]\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s a record player. Like the radio station has– like plays– everything they play is off of CDs and like they have a bunch of records, but they\u0026rsquo;ve never been able to play them? And somebody like found a record player and rather than keep it for themself, they gave it to the radio station.\nOh, I think I like that. Yeah. Then it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a like, “Whoa, you, you, you want everyone to be able to have this thing rather than just having it for yourself or dismantling it? That\u0026rsquo;s amazing. That\u0026rsquo;s incredible.”\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I\u0026rsquo;m going to write something like that.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): You\u0026rsquo;re listening to DOOM FM and that was Harry “Still-us” with Meet Me In The Hallway. Apologies for the rough landing there. We\u0026rsquo;re still getting used to dismounting the records.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve had the record player for about 13 hours now and it hasn\u0026rsquo;t shown any signs of exploding. So I feel comfortable officially announcing that the Boom Twins didn\u0026rsquo;t miss anything in their inspection of it. Not that I\u0026rsquo;m disparaging their work, of course– I love my house and belongings being in approximately one piece each, ladies– just that the nature of our business is one of healthy, active concern. Like a good sourdough starter. The tang of hostile suspicion is how you know we\u0026rsquo;re doing what we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to do.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;m reluctantly getting to the point where I have to admit it seems like someone just… did a good thing.\nMaybe we\u0026rsquo;ll read the letter again once more for the late night crew. “Dear DOOM,” they begin. Their pen is black. It\u0026rsquo;s running out of ink. A couple of words are strangely bolded from the overcompensation of tracing, giving the whole thing the surreal feeling of a code you can\u0026rsquo;t crack– but we do have people on that just in case, as I\u0026rsquo;m sure you can imagine.\nSo they start off with, “Dear DOOM,” and given their actions, I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to believe that\u0026rsquo;s really how they think about us. Then they say, “Found this. Figured more people get use of it if you have it. Crews got less ears than y\u0026rsquo;all do overall. Purse used to talk about your horde of unplayable vinyls. Hope you still have them.” We do, listeners, with one minor caveat. They\u0026rsquo;re now playable.\nGod, I love how raiders and wreckers write. No sentiment they can\u0026rsquo;t fragment.\nThe thing I keep going back to in this letter is the postscript where they say, “Keep an eye on the belt. Had to replace it.” Isn\u0026rsquo;t that something? They found something broken, took the time to fix it, and then gave it away. Because they thought someone else could give it to more people.\nSo all night, we\u0026rsquo;re grabbing random records out of the horde and playing the first track. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. Oh my god, I think this one\u0026rsquo;s a musical. Alright everyone, sit back and enjoy, uh, Judas Iscariot singing Heaven on their Minds.\nSATAH: Alright, good morning. I wrote a bunch of those entries sort of in one go last night, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try and finish it off today so that I can have this journal to the next person with lots of time to do their part.\nSo, draw a card, got the four of spades, roll a d6, got a two. Four of spades and two means that I am feeling… oh, right, spades two is what I got last time as well, so feeling “faith” again. That\u0026rsquo;s interesting. Um, and reacting to “new found shelter.”\nThe first thought I have is a new studio. I think that\u0026rsquo;s… mm. The other potential thing is, like, I talked about how this character lived elsewhere for a while, and I wonder if this is them moving in with somebody essentially or like officially integrating into the community.\nThe other thing is, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve been struggling to play into the negative trait of deceitful, and I think, like, part… like, it… playing that out necessitates a certain level of dramatic irony in this form. Like, you need to know the truth of what they\u0026rsquo;re lying about, because I imagine they\u0026rsquo;re a good liar, you know? So I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to… I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of, like, ways that they could talk about having lied.\nI like the new studio space, but I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s not as… not quite as tied to their arc. Though also I think maybe I\u0026rsquo;m shying away from it because I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be taken away from them, because I\u0026rsquo;m attached.\nYeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s just gonna be that they found a more permanent residence. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re finally admitting that they\u0026rsquo;re actually gonna stay after, you know, doing this for months. They\u0026rsquo;ve been, like, one foot out the door the whole time, and now they\u0026rsquo;re admitting, “Ah, I\u0026rsquo;m probably actually just gonna stay.” And I might play into the lying thing by, like, you know, explaining, like, “Here\u0026rsquo;s some things that I was lying about.” Yeah, possibly, if I can find a good way to work that in.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): You\u0026rsquo;re listening to DOOM FM, your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news.\nThe horde of vinyls is thinning, slowly, thanks to that anonymous donation of a record player we can\u0026rsquo;t stop talking about, but we\u0026rsquo;re not done yet. All week, I\u0026rsquo;m picking random records and playing the first track. That was Secondhand News from Fleetwood Mac, one of the few albums we now have doubles of. But it\u0026rsquo;s fun to find some familiarity in all this chaos, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\nFamiliarity is a funny thing. The way I invoked it there was positive. The comfort of the expected, of the known. You can come to expect and know a lot of things, though. Not all of them are good. We\u0026rsquo;re remarkably adaptable creatures, and it can be easier to do something routine that sucks than something novel that\u0026rsquo;s actually good.\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying out something new right now that, I guess, is the latter. Some members of the DOOM ROOM found out that I was doing my particularly familiar routine of lying to their fucking faces. In this case, about having somewhere to live for the past few months. I mean, I always had a roof over my head, but even for our standards of stability– we’re your on-the-run station for a reason– learning about how I\u0026rsquo;ve been living got a facial expression out of Pursuant Technology herself, if you can believe it. Our weekend morning host, bastion of stoicism, knitted her eyebrows and grimaced at me.\n[Soft laugh]\nMaybe that\u0026rsquo;s what convinced me to let them give me a hand. The unfamiliarity of her reaction, jarring me out of my routine enough to consider trying something new. Or maybe… something else. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m ready to have both feet firmly in. Closing the door one was out of, even. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. It\u0026rsquo;s uncomfortable. It\u0026rsquo;s unfamiliar.\nBut I believe very strongly in what we\u0026rsquo;re doing here. I always have, and I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to believe I should be part of it. For real.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep trying new things together, listener. Not sure what this record is. The cover is black with a triangle and a rainbow on the front. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a prism, refracting light? There\u0026rsquo;s no name or anything. I prefer to be able to introduce it, but I\u0026rsquo;m trusting you to be in it with me, even if I can\u0026rsquo;t. All night. Here on DOOM FM.\nSATAH: Card time. I am beginning to get nervous that this is going to be an incredibly long run, because I haven\u0026rsquo;t pulled a king or a jack or a queen or an ace yet. I could do three in a row. This is– such is the neighbour… such is the neighbour of randomness? Boy. Such is the nature of randomness. But I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nSo pull the seven of hearts and I\u0026rsquo;m rolling a d6. I got a two. So feeling– hearts and a two– feeling “love.” Haha! Reacting to a seven, which is “usable technology found.” Fascinating.\nWhat does this character love? The revolution? [Light snort-laugh]\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to separate love from like faith or hope. What a sentence. Uh. But I haven\u0026rsquo;t like established any close relationships for this person? I guess members of the crew? Like the radio– the station crew?\nWhat kind of usable technology is exciting? I had been thinking like, phone, but I actually already said in one of the earlier entries that there was a call in. So they already have that. Could be another phone? That\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny. Um, like they now have the ability to have multiple– like they can do call waiting to have multiple people lined up.\nNo, I think I want it to be more personal. I think I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be the– for the radio station.\nTape… player… I think… like the radio station has one, but I think this is going to be like for, you know, a birthday or an anniversary of some kind, people at the radio station got this character– who I should probably name– a personal tape player so they can like listen to stuff on their own time.\nYeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s going to be like a– it\u0026rsquo;s either their birthday or like the anniversary of them getting unplugged or whatever. And it\u0026rsquo;s going to be like they\u0026rsquo;ve been trying– they were going to keep it a secret, but all of the other hosts have been talking about it all day and they\u0026rsquo;re like staring at this gift that was left for them.\nIt might even be a radio because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny to be able to write something like, “I work here and I can\u0026rsquo;t listen.” Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out. But I think I think that\u0026rsquo;s the general gist of it. And so the love they\u0026rsquo;re feeling is for like, you know– I don\u0026rsquo;t have to tell you. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to tell you. You can figure that out.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): Thanks for tuning in to our interruption free power hour every weeknight here on DOOM FM, your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news. It\u0026rsquo;s time to settle in with me, Celebration Establishment, the one who carries you through the night to that sunrise we’re told is inevitable. One day, when the smog clears, I\u0026rsquo;ll carry you to one we can actually see.\nSo… obviously there\u0026rsquo;s something I have to address. I know for a fact that anyone who works for a highly illegal pirate radio station is capable of keeping their trap shut, so I\u0026rsquo;m forced to conclude that today was on purpose. Yes, as you heard all day, today is my re-birthday. One year ago exactly, I gasped my way out of a Potreblyat pod, convulsed wetly on the floor for several minutes while groping connector cables out of my skull and spine, and dragged myself out into the wastes to convalesce or croak.\nI was going to let this go unmentioned. I may have even… heavily implied that it was a completely different date. But a stubborn gang of ne\u0026rsquo;er do well reporters and professional busybodies is proving increasingly difficult to keep secrets from, so here we are. They spilled the beans and played my favourite music all day. How dare they.\n[Laugh]\nThank you for your calls. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I can… I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I\u0026rsquo;ve brought you the occasional laugh or rueful smile in the middle of the night. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for the opportunity to accompany you from the dim change of sunset to the dim change of sunrise. I am; I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to accompany you through changes.\nThank you also to the DOOM ROOM. This is a funny thing for me to admit, but times being what they are and all, I\u0026rsquo;ve never owned a radio. I catch our show like anyone else, in someone else\u0026rsquo;s car or on borrowed time from a neighbour.\nI had planned to spend tonight detailing my theories on why Producer Dag has been so secretive about the results of a recent raid– happy re-birthday, go ahead and rip up your banter prep– but it turns out they were hiding a gift from me. A radio of my very own, recovered from some trash heap and carefully returned to life. Like me, I guess. Like a lot of us.\nIt has stickers on it. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to tell you what they are, but they\u0026rsquo;re nice. They\u0026rsquo;re… I like them. And they\u0026rsquo;re there because of the sticker– here, meaning the one who sticks, the placer of stickers– knew that. And that\u0026rsquo;s meaningful. It is.\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m going to redo my tracklist on the fly, but for now, here\u0026rsquo;s the first song I was going to play during my investigation tonight. Spoiler alert, they\u0026rsquo;re all fucking James Bond themes, that\u0026rsquo;s the bit. Madonna\u0026rsquo;s Die Another Day. May that title be true for as long as it possibly can.\nSATAH: Alright, next card is a five of diamonds. Gonna roll.\nOoh, so a diamond three means feeling “hatred.” And a five for what I\u0026rsquo;m reacting to is “discovered knowledge about the world.” Ooh.\nWell, last time I did this, it was about finding out that they were still using me as a radio host on the other side. Um… so I might play off of that? I\u0026rsquo;m also… I\u0026rsquo;m drawn to making it bigger. Um, like the idea that this is some sort of big discovery that affects a lot of people, like a data dump.\nYeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t– I\u0026rsquo;m going to figure that out while I\u0026rsquo;m writing, I think, but I think like some sort of big data dump that a lot of people will have been affected by– probably even like something that was like covered, like uncovered by reporting from this radio station. And the hatred is, you know, hatred of this corporation. I feel like that\u0026rsquo;s more interesting to me than trying to find like a personal hatred, at least in this moment.\nSo yeah, not 100% sure. But something in that area for sure.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): You\u0026rsquo;re back on DOOM FM. That was General Theory of Nothing by Cosine Tenacity. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard of them, blame Potreblyat.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re just tuning in for the first time today, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry and welcome. This morning, Purse started naming names from the huge record excavation we\u0026rsquo;ve been working on for months. She talked about the reporters they killed to stop them from causing the cataclysm. After her, Sit did a rare weekend appearance to dissect some internal memos that have only previously been seen heavily redacted. Director and Selection read the words of some assassinated poets. Con talked to callers who found out their friends and family didn\u0026rsquo;t die from a bad unplug, they were purposefully disposed of by corporate thugs.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to be combing through all this stuff all weekend, all week, all month. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge amount of information, and we\u0026rsquo;re sharing all of it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not as articulate as some of those folks. I try my best and we have a good time. We got different specialties. We’re all– we all have different limitations on how well we can speak when we\u0026rsquo;re angry. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to let the experts talk. What I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is my job. I\u0026rsquo;m going to play some tapes.\nTapes. Ol’ reliable. We can play CDs and records at the station, but if you\u0026rsquo;re not listening to us, you\u0026rsquo;re probably listening to a tape. For a long time, we\u0026rsquo;ve assumed that recordings are divided neatly up into pre-cataclysm and post-cataclysm, which felt reasonable to an extent. Who had time to record while the world was actively falling apart? Who would want to? Or maybe tape recorders weren\u0026rsquo;t working. They work now, but maybe they didn\u0026rsquo;t for a while.\nIn retrospect, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty naive, right? There\u0026rsquo;s one thing humans will do, it\u0026rsquo;s make stuff. Try to share it. There probably isn\u0026rsquo;t an era in history without it, no matter how violent or apocalyptic.\nSo yes, during the cataclysm, people were making music. A lot of it. Protest songs, obviously, and coded political messages and songs that don\u0026rsquo;t sound like protest songs, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, but also just… songs. Feelings. Thoughts. Shit people write music about. And they\u0026rsquo;ve just been sitting in the box where they were unceremoniously shoved after the creators were killed.\nOur corporate overlords never wanted you to hear these songs. We\u0026rsquo;re not giving them what they want. Tonight, all night on DOOM FM: martyr special.\nThis next one doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a track list, but the band is called Transport. Let the ghosts speak to you. They might be able to keep you from joining them for a while.\nSATAH: All right, journal number eight.\nOh my goodness, still not a face card. Eight of spades and a one. Spades one means feeling “overconfidence.” Interesting. And an eight, reacting to– ooh– “secrets of Potreblyat revealed.” Huh.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m going to make this one kind of easy on myself by not deciding what the secret is because Cel wouldn\u0026rsquo;t, you know, say on the air, but I think I can just write them like doing vague threats. And they did just like find a whole bunch of, you know, records from them. So it makes sense. I think I think, yeah, this is just going to be sort of a chill entry with bait. Just just try to bait– bait them and tease them and annoy them being like, I know something you don\u0026rsquo;t know. Yeah.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): That was Owen Pallet’s What Do You Think Will Happen Now? back to back with Francis and the Lights and Chance the Rapper\u0026rsquo;s. May I Have This Dance and this is DOOM FM, where tonight, we\u0026rsquo;re asking a lot of questions. We\u0026rsquo;re on a bit of a streak with answers, is the thing. We\u0026rsquo;re continuing to dig through the results of our record excavation and we\u0026rsquo;re finding a lot of interesting answers to a lot of very, very interesting questions. Like– well. Wouldn’t you like to know? Aren\u0026rsquo;t you so, so curious what we found out? What they didn\u0026rsquo;t want us to know, but now we do?\nIn time, I promise we\u0026rsquo;ll tell you. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll see the effects and you\u0026rsquo;ll know.\nBut for tonight, since we\u0026rsquo;re on a bit of a roll, I\u0026rsquo;m just throwing questions at the wall. Questions artists have been asking for a century or more. Here\u0026rsquo;s one I think we\u0026rsquo;d all like to know the answer to– maybe we\u0026rsquo;re closer than ever.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Four Non-Blondes with What’s Up?\nSATAH: Okay, we\u0026rsquo;ve officially passed the lowest– I did like practice pulls to see approximately how long this game would take and the lowest one I had before I pulled three face cards was nine. So we\u0026rsquo;re about to pass that.\nBut it is our first face card! Jack of diamonds and I rolled a two. Diamonds two, feeling “scepticism.” That makes sense… because the Jack is… a symbol of hope. Okay. But that makes sense. This character would absolutely be sceptical of hope. I am reacting to “a meeting with peaceful mutant survivors.” That\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\nSo Cel lived in the wastes for a while. And so they probably saw a lot of mutants and stuff. Um…\n[Gasp] Oh, yeah. Okay. So these are mutants from the waste who have been listening to the radio station and they played– they\u0026rsquo;re reacting to um, like us playing the tapes of musicians who the corporation had killed? It\u0026rsquo;s either friends of theirs or one of them. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s my scepticism: they\u0026rsquo;re claiming like, “That was me. They didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to kill us. We survived. We\u0026rsquo;re just different now.” And I\u0026rsquo;m like, Mm, maybe. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s probably what it\u0026rsquo;s going to be. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll find out more as I\u0026rsquo;m writing.\nBut I think that\u0026rsquo;s what it is. They are survivors who have heard us broadcasting the tapes and they are familiar with them and so they wanted to speak with us.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): You\u0026rsquo;re listening to DOOM FM. Your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news. Coming up next, we\u0026rsquo;ve got… well, something pretty exciting.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to debut a new single from TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS. If that name rings a bell, it might be from a couple weeks ago when I spent a few nights playing music from artists who were assassinated by our corporate overlords.\nNow, how could a dead musician record new music? Great question. Allegedly, at least one of them didn\u0026rsquo;t actually die. They were left to die but didn\u0026rsquo;t, deep in the wastes. Which should be enough to kill you by itself, but sometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what should happen, only what does.\nSo they laid there in the muck soaking up who knows what for who knows how long and eventually they got up. A little different. More different now after a few years out there, but on their own feet. Just the two of them, even, which isn\u0026rsquo;t the case for everyone out there.\nSo I guess some of the upgrades we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing lately are working and our signal is now reaching further than ever. We\u0026rsquo;re bringing in a whole new audience from where we didn\u0026rsquo;t even know there was one to be found. And wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, they tune in the very day that we end up playing music made by a bunch of their friends and comrades.\nYou wouldn\u0026rsquo;t blame them for wanting to just keep quiet out there but I guess they wanted to send a little message. Try as you might, you can\u0026rsquo;t just bury the past. Especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t double tap it.\nSo here we are with the new single from TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS, or what remains of them: STILL FUCKIN KICKIN.\nSATAH: An Ace, the Ace of Clubs. And we\u0026rsquo;ll roll a d6 and get a 5. So for clubs and then rolled 5, feeling “guilt,” reacting to, and an ace is… a bad one right? Yes. Ooo. Okay, reacting to “Potreblyat defenses find you.”\nMan, how intense do I want to get with this? Because feeling guilt can mean a lot of different things, like whether it\u0026rsquo;s deserved or not, I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure.\nBut what, what, what, what could they find? Obviously a radio station. It could be me, specifically. Like I could go back to the well of um, my voice being used, and it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing of like, you know, the defenses finding me and mocking me, like “thanks for giving us more material” or whatever. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want to retread that. So finding one of the stations is definitely possible.\nMaybe… yeah. I think probably they\u0026rsquo;re gonna do a raid of some kind, trying to get back some of the material that the radio station took. And so the guilt, I think, is probably something like, you know, “maybe I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have played– like maybe I goaded them too much.” Though I did– I did have the characteristic moralistic, which makes me think like they would think like, “I was doing the right thing.”\nYeah, I think, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll find a little bit more of the motivation in the writing, but I know that there was a raid and yeah, yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s just, let\u0026rsquo;s, let\u0026rsquo;s, let\u0026rsquo;s find that in the, in the writing.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): You’re listening to DOOM FM, your particularly-on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news. For anyone just tuning in now, I\u0026rsquo;ll say again, sorry for the change in plans, but I won\u0026rsquo;t be taking calls tonight. Hopefully Talkback Tuesday will be in full swing again soon, but my shows are going to be a little different for… some amount of time. Just while we beef security back up again.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to balance wanting to explain things to you, share whole truths, never bury something you could uncover, all of the shit we\u0026rsquo;d have on little embroidered pillows around here if that were something we did… it\u0026rsquo;s hard to balance that with safety. We\u0026rsquo;re always having to evaluate that balance. Constantly, all day, every day, but especially right now.\nSo yes, I\u0026rsquo;ll say what everyone else has been saying. We are united in this. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to stop. A couple lucky raids and a few smashed crates of tapes will barely slow us down. We\u0026rsquo;re glad they\u0026rsquo;re scared. They should be.\nWhat I want to say that the rest of the DOOM ROOM doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily agree with me on is just that… I think… I think that I learned– well, I think I\u0026rsquo;m remembering that someone with my… stature… my history… needs to be a little more careful than– well, maybe than I have been.\nThe general consensus is that there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to believe that my presence contributed at all to the increased efforts, that it\u0026rsquo;s just a sign we\u0026rsquo;re on the right track with what we\u0026rsquo;re exposing. I just can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder if the increased attention I brought bringing my voice to this project…\nWell, it isn\u0026rsquo;t– it isn’t worth dwelling on. We\u0026rsquo;re doing the right thing. I’m… it took me so long to be convinced to stay, it would be probably just giving them what they want if I were to leave now. And we\u0026rsquo;re doing the right thing. We are.\nOkay. Um.\nSo, yeah, I usually try to keep my banter in the same tone as the theme, but anyway, um, resilience, right? Uh. This is Childish Gambino\u0026rsquo;s A Place Where Love Goes.\nSATAH: Next card. Two of diamonds. I was starting to wonder if this was just going to be the run of face cards that would end the game, but not yet. Got at least one more diversion. So I pulled a two of diamonds. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a d6. Got a three. So with the diamonds and a three, the thing I\u0026rsquo;m feeling is “hatred.” That makes sense given stuff that\u0026rsquo;s been happening. And two, the thing I\u0026rsquo;m reacting to, is “a new path reveals itself.” Huh.\nOkay. Well, my first instinct is like, you know, I\u0026rsquo;ve been wallowing in my guilt and anger over the raid and the new path is like some sort of, you know, direct, like very reckless violence. But I think, you know, as I\u0026rsquo;m, as I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about it, I think that what it\u0026rsquo;s going to be is a path that I\u0026rsquo;m not taking.\nYeah. So I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be that somebody from the corporation like reached out to me and they were like, “Hey, you\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling really shitty, right? About how maybe being around you puts your friends in danger? Well, we\u0026rsquo;ll stop bothering them if you just come back and work with us or something.” I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to think of like how I want to characterise the corporation. Like if they\u0026rsquo;re doing that in a super naive, overconfident way, or if they actually have a genuinely compelling offer to give.\nBut I think that\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;s going to be. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be the path that has revealed itself is one that I\u0026rsquo;m refusing to take and the very act of like considering it or having been offered it is the thing that has like ignited this hatred and probably rage.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): Welcome back to DOOM FM. Your on-the-run station for pre cataclysm tunes and uncensored news.\nThis has been a… long, long day for me. Long week, long month, long life. Mm… may that last one only become more and more true.\nI thought I should let you know something. I got a job offer today. Yes, indeed– from a listener of the show, in fact. A listener who tortured some encryption data out of another listener. A corporate spy with a gun on her hip and a posture like she wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about having to use it. Not because no one was going to get shot, of course, but because the shot would come from somewhere a little less expected. You know the type.\nSo what this listener says to me– like a lot of you, she wanted to offer her support after my little show of insecurity last week. I\u0026rsquo;ve appreciated a lot of that support, but this particular form of it… well, not exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for, actually.\nThe job offer had the standard trade: you give us a little something, we\u0026rsquo;ll give you a little remuneration. Not in money, of course, but in a lack of something. Attention. She claimed they\u0026rsquo;ll lay off the station– no more raids, no more running– if I just pick up where my plugged in version left off out here, become the voice of their propaganda on the outside, maybe do some pickups for the internal station too, just when it\u0026rsquo;s necessary!\nShe tried to make it sound like they\u0026rsquo;re only bothering us for fun! They don\u0026rsquo;t care about the work we\u0026rsquo;re doing! It\u0026rsquo;s inconsequential. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even really be a problem for me to leave, you know, not like we\u0026rsquo;re having an effect!\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s bullshit. I\u0026rsquo;m– listen. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to tell you I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m a liability. But everyone, every person, every relationship, everything that we do together is laden with liabilities. They\u0026rsquo;re inherent and necessary and we take them on on purpose so that we can access the benefits they also grant us.\nThe rest of the DOOM ROOM… [Laughs disbelievingly] wants me here. I want to be here. The work is real and I don\u0026rsquo;t believe for a second that we don\u0026rsquo;t scare them.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sorry that I ever made it seem like I might leave. I\u0026rsquo;m staying here with you until we get what we deserve, one way or another.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another song from the TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS upcoming album: YOU OWE US.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

Unplugged Survivor is a consecutive journaling game about waking up from a corporate VR prison charmingly called True Reality, finding yourself in a post-apocalyptic hellscape, and keeping a diary about it. The main game loop is pulling cards and rolling a d6 to get a prompt for your next journal entry. Each face card is an omen: Kings and Aces are ominous, Jacks and Queens are hopeful. And your character\u0026rsquo;s ending is determined by which category you pull three of first. When your character meets whatever that ending is, their entries are passed along to the next player in hopes that their character will be able to learn something from your journey to carry in theirs.\u003c/p\u003e","title":""},{"content":"FOLIO TRANSCRIPTS EPISODE 005 | UNPLUGGED SURVIVOR 02 INTRO SATAH: Welcome to Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah, and I\u0026rsquo;m showcasing multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together. If it ever sounds like I find that intro way funnier than it is, it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;ve taken way too many takes to get it on wax.\nThis is episode 2 of our game of Unplugged Survivor, a game by We Are Heroes Productions and the Tabletop for the End of the World podcast. I promise I am not leading you on when I say that joining me are Happy Birthday and Darling Demon Eclipse. Check out HB\u0026rsquo;s work at gm36.itch.io and Eclipse at eclipse.gay. She recently released a sexy, cool, weird sci-fi romance duet TTRPG called Biotrophication, which I think fits marvellously into the background of the world that we\u0026rsquo;re building in this game, so please check that out as well.\nI know the format of this second series is very different from the format of the first, because the format of the game itself is very different. I hope to explore a lot of different but similar experiences over the course of this show, and I really hope that you enjoy kinda coming along with me as I do. This game is definitely closer to the epistolary end of solo and epistolary, but part of the point of the whole show is that you do hear someone other than me playing, and you are going to hear someone other than me playing. My run just ended up very long.\nThere were about six weeks in between when I wrote the first entries and when I wrote the final ones, and in those weeks, I went through a breakup, caught covid, and wrapped up my final full semester of school. You can absolutely hear the time and circumstances weighing on me as I keep going, and honestly, I am giving myself a single firm gruff pat on the back for sticking with it.\nI am glad that I decided to do a little pilot season of five games in the way that I did as I prepared to launch this show, because holy shit, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot about the structures I need to put in place to keep games contained enough that the production doesn\u0026rsquo;t totally spiral out of control.\nAnd I want to say all of this in part because I want to be very clear that none of this is a slight on the game itself. I really want to emphasize that because I think there are times as I\u0026rsquo;m trying to decide where to go next in my recordings that I sound a little frustrated or very tired, and I just want it to be very explicit that that\u0026rsquo;s me straining against the constraints of making a podcast and against knowing I\u0026rsquo;m about to ask a couple of my friends to do the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m doing. It isn\u0026rsquo;t me straining against the game itself. The game has evocative prompts, and I love the, like, slow burn of uncertainty that the random ending mechanic introduces. It was stressful. It was stressful for the me that podcasts, but it was exciting for the me that plays. We are all of us so many versions of ourselves, my friends.\nAlright.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s hand the mic back over to Celebration Establishment, night host of DOOM FM.\nGAME SATAH: Alright had to take a little break there between entries because of various life circumstances, like getting the novel coronavirus, which I do not recommend.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pull a card for number 12. Six of diamonds. And then I need to roll a d6. I got a six. So I\u0026rsquo;m feeling: diamonds six is “betrayal.” Reacting to: six is “a mutated creature appears.” Huh huh huh huh.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to undermine the band. TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS. I like that they\u0026rsquo;re allies. And that\u0026rsquo;s real.\nUm, I\u0026rsquo;m curious to explore these being separate things. Like I am not betrayed by something necessar– like I\u0026rsquo;m reacting to mutated creature appearing, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the betrayal that I\u0026rsquo;m feeling. Yeah. Yeah, I think the mutated creature is going to be at most symbolic? Like I have this image– I have this image of this character who I believe I named, but I cannot remember at the moment. Is it Celebration Establishment? I think so. That\u0026rsquo;s funny. I\u0026rsquo;m sure they had a nickname. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to read back at some point and figure out what it was.\nBut I have this image of Cel, like, looking out the window as they\u0026rsquo;re recording and seeing— it\u0026rsquo;s probably not going to be this, but the classic would be a deer with too many antlers or fucked up eyes or whatever. It seems like that\u0026rsquo;s always kind of a mainstay. It happens in The 100. It happens, I think, in Fallout. It happens in the Annihilation movie. It\u0026rsquo;s an absolute classic.\nAnyway, just like the– this– of Cel looking out the window and seeing a mutated creature and just sort of, um, meditating on it, and like… I wonder if — I started to think about using it as a — if it\u0026rsquo;s a symbol, if it\u0026rsquo;s a metaphor, sort of going like, you know, the ways that corporations betrayed us that led to what I\u0026rsquo;m looking at and that sort of thing.\nI wonder if it\u0026rsquo;s just that. No, I think I want there to be another layer to it, so there is some amount of personal betrayal. Do I want to figure that out right now?\nOh, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be that they found out that… like, the person who contacted them last time, the corporate spy who offered them a job, that they were like, either told or had been assuming that some sort of encryption data had been tortured out of somebody to get that information. And then what they\u0026rsquo;re learning is that actually somebody gave it up willingly, in exchange for something, probably. But somebody gave it up willingly for their own personal ends and so the betrayal is that and then the meditation of it with the symbol of staring out at this creature is like something about having to take care of each other and not giving in to those that would divide us and that kind of thing? Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out in the writing, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s the general shape of it.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): You\u0026rsquo;re listening to DOOM FM. Your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news. The place we\u0026rsquo;ve run to today specifically is interesting in one particularly novel way: it has a window right in the studio. As you might imagine, for both security and sound quality, we spend a lot of time in rooms where the outside world can\u0026rsquo;t potentially make eye contact with us and in return, we can\u0026rsquo;t look at it ourselves.\nI\u0026rsquo;m making eye contact with something right now, or at least I think I am. It has too many eyes for me to know for sure, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly gone very still and seems to be focusing its attention on me. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure… what it used to be. Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s always been this. At this point, you know, we\u0026rsquo;re probably starting to get far enough down the chain of evolution that it\u0026rsquo;s foolish to cling to the idea that it all comes directly from the old world. Maybe a deer and a wild turkey might not have been able to progenate at the time, but at a certain point, a lot of the rules changed, didn\u0026rsquo;t they? Who knows what\u0026rsquo;s happening deep, deep in the Wastes? What new, unseen contexts have been set up, allowing for the creation of things we just have no reference for?\nBut of course, we all know there\u0026rsquo;s a line of effects and causes and blame and consequences, shitstorms, unceasing from the dawn of time, past the end of it and on and on forever into the thing we still stubbornly call the future. We talk about the end of the world, but we are here to talk about it. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that funny?\nBut we only… we\u0026rsquo;re only able to be here to talk about it because of each other. Remember that, listeners. Don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone convince you that it\u0026rsquo;s fair to only think of yourself. Not now, not ever. I know I\u0026rsquo;m just a voice on the radio, but the signals I send out only exist if someone hears them. No, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that a tree that falls alone in a forest makes a sound, not if absolutely nothing is there to hear it. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it does.\nWe aren\u0026rsquo;t trees, though. We can hear ourselves or feel the vibrations within ourselves. Anything you do, you\u0026rsquo;re there for it. Try not to… I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Just don\u0026rsquo;t be an asshole. Just try.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s starting to rain. The thing outside is opening what I think are its mouths, allowing the water to flow inside. Still staring at me.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s… I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to hit play.\nSATAH: It’s lucky 13, baby. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nMaking sure I\u0026rsquo;m not pulling from my Strange Places deck and am pulling from my Unplugged Survivors deck…\nMy god. It\u0026rsquo;s getting to the point where when I don\u0026rsquo;t pull a face card, it\u0026rsquo;s like weird. I just… whoa, sorry. [Voice pitches upwards] You just probably heard– my voice changed. I was still talking in my character voice. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise it. Oh, that was bizarre. Okay.\nSo, got a 3 of hearts. Gonna roll a d6. 4. So, roll of 4 on hearts is feeling “surprise.” And the value 3 reacting to “archived 21st and 20th century entertainment found.”\n[Little giggle]\nI\u0026rsquo;ve really made a lot of world building choices that, um… [Laughing] are very funny with the in-game prompts. My instinct is to be like, oops, but then also I\u0026rsquo;m like, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of what these games are for to me? So… good? Anyway.\nI\u0026rsquo;m feeling “surprise,” “archived 21st and 20th century entertainment found.” Well yeah, I guess one thing that\u0026rsquo;s true is that when we found a big stash before, it was, like, closer to modern era entertainment, like, rebels during the Cataclysm and maybe just after and all that kind of thing. And so, yeah, we can find something that is just our usual milieu.\nYeah, maybe the event isn\u0026rsquo;t gonna provide a lot of inspiration here just because like, that is incredibly in line with what I\u0026rsquo;ve got going on. And so it\u0026rsquo;s “surprise.” What\u0026rsquo;s surprising about it?\nMmm. The thing that came to mind there was the idea that there\u0026rsquo;s a third album from an artist that, like, we were all convinced only had two. And I\u0026rsquo;m not sure– because the path there would be almost like a “Shit, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot we don\u0026rsquo;t know.” Um.\nI mentioned a Harry Styles song in one of these entries and so part of me is really tempted… oh no, this is so stupid, but I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do it. I might change the artist because it might be too silly, but also like, fuck it. The idea that we have records of all of the solo work from all of the members of One Direction, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t know they were in a band? And we found like some One Direction albums and we\u0026rsquo;re like, “Wait, what the fuck?” Oh, is that too silly? I don\u0026rsquo;t care. I think it\u0026rsquo;s fun. I\u0026rsquo;m allowed to get a little silly with it.\nOh my god, making this character do a deep dive of One Direction songs because they\u0026rsquo;re like, wait, Harry Styles and Liam Payne and these other three were all in like, holy shit, we have to play these whole– you have to play the entire discography because this is insane.\nI\u0026rsquo;m doing it. I\u0026rsquo;m doing it. It\u0026rsquo;s silly and I\u0026rsquo;m doing it.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): [Laughing] Alright. Alright. Great. Absolutely. You\u0026rsquo;re listening to DOOM FM, your on-the-run station for blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\nWe continue to be on One Direction lockdown. We\u0026rsquo;re getting absolutely awful feedback from this segment. I don\u0026rsquo;t give a fuck. We\u0026rsquo;re listening to every One Direction song in chronological order. That was the first track off of their, uh, third album, Midnight Memories, called Best Song Ever. Bold titles, but who am I to judge?\nFor those of you fortunate and unfortunate enough to just be tuning in, we recently came upon an incredible cache of CDs– maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll tell you how someday– and imagine my surprise when I recognized a young Harry “Still-us” in the photo of a band. Then as I looked closer, I realised I knew the other four as well. All of their work pops up occasionally.\nIt turns out the five of them were in a band first. It\u0026rsquo;s absurd. It\u0026rsquo;s beyond belief. It makes me wonder about the sourcing of our other music. What are we missing? What history do we not have access to because we took supplies from the basement of someone who loved Zayn Malik but not his early project?\nSo yes, to honour that– and because I\u0026rsquo;m having fun, and doing segments that go against almost unanimous advice from the rest of the DOOM ROOM occasionally tickles me– we\u0026rsquo;re going through each album, song by song.\nAt the midpoint of tonight, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have Producer Dag herself into the studio to present her thoughts on their evolution so far and to continue to compare and contrast the band\u0026rsquo;s work with the members\u0026rsquo; later solo work. She wants me to assure you that she agrees I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing this, but if I\u0026rsquo;m going to do it, I should at least do it right. Everyone remember to send in your thanks to Dag for enabling and guiding us all.\nWhich, I can only assume, having not listened to it, is a perfect segue into our next song. From One Direction\u0026rsquo;s Midnight Memories, it\u0026rsquo;s Story Of My Life.\nSATAH: That brought me so much joy. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what horrendous thing happens next. I probably can\u0026rsquo;t write about One Direction for this one.\nSeven of diamonds. Still no face cards. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll… one! So feeling: diamonds one is “violence.” Ooh. Reacting to a seven, “usable technology found.” Huh.\nI mean, the first instinct is definitely that, like, that means having found a weapon of some kind.\nHm… feeling “violence.” I guess that could mean, like, wanting to commit it or even already having committed it? Like, that could mean a lot of things. What\u0026rsquo;s the direction I want to go here?\n“Usable technology found.”\nOne of my first ideas is too big. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s the idea that an EMP or something was found that could take out the pods of everybody who\u0026rsquo;s plugged in, but that it would probably kill a lot of them. I think that\u0026rsquo;s too big because I think, like, I\u0026rsquo;m just not interested in having that big of a moral quandary at this stage in the story, like, figuring out if it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. So I want it to be something that is smaller scale.\nWhat have the other technologies that we\u0026rsquo;ve found been? There was, like, a record player, right? Yes, okay, there was the record player and then there was the radio that was given to Cel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I really hope that I name this person Cel. And that… I\u0026rsquo;m not just making that up. I should go back and listen, but I want to be as surprised as everyone else. So\u0026hellip;\nAnyway, “usable technology found.” A fridge comes to mind for some reason, but I want– like, that would mean that the violence is something about, like, food insecurity, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to go there. I mean, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to be, but that would be, like, sort of the first place to look.\nYeah, I mean, I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a weapon of some kind, just not with, like, something as high stakes as, you know, the dilemma of, like, do we leave all these people plugged in or forcefully unplug them and then most of them will die? But, like, could blow up a building.\nYeah, I think just to settle on, like, the direction of, like, the “feeling ‘violence’,” I think that it\u0026rsquo;s going to be something that, like, has occurred or is occurring simultaneously. Like, this is a pre-recorded broadcast and, like, the thing has already happened and it\u0026rsquo;s going to be something about, like, we found a way to take out some defenses or an office or something and I think I\u0026rsquo;m not even going to necessarily, like, settle on what exactly happened because I think this is just going to be, like, a pre-recorded message that is, like, gloating a little bit? But not necessarily giving specifics because of the nature of it.\nI really have set myself up in a funny place when it comes to, like, giving details because these are all, like, public messages? But I kind of think that\u0026rsquo;s a fun line to walk so, yeah.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll get there but it\u0026rsquo;s something in that area. And I guess the other thing is that, like, “usable technology” could mean a lot of things because it can mean– like, there\u0026rsquo;s sort of, like, an immediate interpretation of, like, oh, we found something rare that still works but it can also just be, like, we found something that we can use, right? Which could, like, literally be, like, we found a fuse box that we can turn off, you know?\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll- I\u0026rsquo;ll- I\u0026rsquo;m gonna- I\u0026rsquo;m gonna get there in the writing. That\u0026rsquo;s the shape of it.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): Welcome back to DOOM FM, your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news.\nOf course, we\u0026rsquo;re still making our way through every single song released by One Direction, a newly discovered supergroup that was formed before its members would have given it the status of supergroup. That was History, the last track on Made in the AM, their last album. At least as far as we know. We sure didn\u0026rsquo;t find a later one. We still haven\u0026rsquo;t solved the mystery of the missing member on the cover. If any of you have information, of course, let us know.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re lucky enough that this particular hoarder had the deluxe edition, so we\u0026rsquo;re gonna have a couple of bonus tracks to work through. But not tonight. Tonight, well…\nOur deepest apologies if a big boom interrupted your enjoyment of that track. In many ways, we– I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t say we, the rest of the DOOM ROOM is more relieved than anyone that this project is coming to an end– in many ways, I understand that this song was a finale. We hate to interrupt a satisfying climax, but timing is a funny thing.\nAt this point, I have to reveal that tonight\u0026rsquo;s show was pre-recorded. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry for the deception, listeners, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;re beginning to understand. Enforcers might be distracted, or they might be out on the streets with additional force. We don\u0026rsquo;t know, so keep yourself safe. Stay on high alert, extra high alert. Risk a glance east if you want to see some fireworks in the Potreblyat Stronghold, but don\u0026rsquo;t look for too long and head underground as soon as you can. Metaphorically, literally, we\u0026rsquo;re doing the same.\nThe rest of the night is gonna loop some safety information, but keep us on in the background if you can. We\u0026rsquo;ll interrupt ourselves with any breaking news. For now, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, and good night.\nThis is a pre-recorded message about a red alert. Details are not yet public, but there have been explosions in multiple Potreblyat buildings. This was expected and should be celebrated, but first, we have to get through to tomorrow. Head underground immediately. Keep yourself and each other safe. This message will repeat until we can give the all clear. Any live updates will be preceded by a 15 second tone. Thank you for tuning in to DOOM FM. [Fading out] This is a pre-recorded message about a red alert. This is a pre-recorded message about a red alert. Details are not yet public, but there have been explosions in multiple Potreblyat buildings. This was expected and should be celebrated, but first, we have to get through to tomorrow.\nSATAH: Incredible news. I still managed to write about One Direction.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pull another card. Four of diamonds! My god. This is just… this is… I want to go through the deck so badly to see where all the face cards are hidden. I really hope that I don\u0026rsquo;t– I mean, unless they\u0026rsquo;re having fun. I was going to say I hope that no one else has to do something this long, but maybe they want to? I just feel bad about giving this much work to guests. I now know for next time some adjustments I should make for games like this.\nRolling a d6, getting a four. Also feels like I\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of diamonds, right?\nSATAH, OVER THE INTRO SOUNDTRACK: Hi it\u0026rsquo;s interstitial Satah popping in real quick to say that in fact yes, at this point I had pulled seven diamonds, four spades, and two each of clubs and hearts. Incredibly unbalanced. In the last episode, I will link to a chart of our results because I love that kind of shit.\nSATAH, PLAYING THE GAME: So diamonds four is “rage.” And a four value on the card is reacting to “newfound shelter.” Huh huh huh huh. Am I mad about the shelter?\nFor some reason this clicked for me relatively quickly. I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be reacting to something found in the shelter. And I think what this is, is that like– whatever–, the explosion or whatever that we caused in the last journal entry has forced Potreblyat to like abandon part of the city that they were occupying? And so we\u0026rsquo;re reclaiming it and gonna find something in there that like makes me mad.\nIt might just be supplies, honestly. It might just be seeing like how well they\u0026rsquo;ve been living? Like there\u0026rsquo;s like a barracks for employees and enforcers or whatever. And it\u0026rsquo;s like these motherfuckers had air conditioning. Maybe not quite to that extent, but something like that. It\u0026rsquo;s just, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be like reacting to, you know, they\u0026rsquo;re taking this shit from us. Yeah.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): Statistically, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that several of you are hearing me from a brand new speaker. Welcome to a slightly higher definition DOOM FM. Your on-the-run station for pre cataclysm tunes and uncensored news.\nIt was fun walking around the east sector today and hearing a consistent stream of my colleagues’ voices. The new digs are looking pretty incredible. It\u0026rsquo;s wild how the other side has been living. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it? I’m not the type to give ground to anyone who works for those fucks, but seeing the infrastructure of their barracks… phew! You do start to understand it. You don\u0026rsquo;t forgive it, but you start to put some pieces together.\nI should only speak for myself, but I actually want that to serve as a reminder for anyone listening. You don\u0026rsquo;t forgive it. Even if you come to understand it, you don\u0026rsquo;t forgive it and you don\u0026rsquo;t replicate it.\nWithout ongoing corporate support, a lot of the grid that supports these amenities is going to start failing. Experts are working on transforming that which can be self-sustaining into something that sustains itself, but even amongst all the rubble and ashes, this is the peak of this place’s comfort. Keep that in mind.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a cheerful thought, I know, that things can only get worse from here, but… look. It\u0026rsquo;s just important to temper our expectations. You’re not… entitled to this. None of us are. This has to be something we share. It has to be, or we are just like them. Worse, even, because we should know better. We have to know better. Those fuckers. Those absolute…\nAnyway, tonight we\u0026rsquo;re playing songs about home. Here\u0026rsquo;s the White Stripes with Little Room back to back with the Weakerthans’ Confessions of a Futon Revolutionist.\nSATAH: You know, I just checked, and when I did practise pulls for this, the average actually was 14 entries. It\u0026rsquo;s just that the lowest one was nine. So I\u0026rsquo;m only a little bit above average, and not yet to the highest example I did, which was 19. And I think that the stress I\u0026rsquo;m feeling is entirely that I\u0026rsquo;m asking guests to do the same thing, and I worry that it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of responsibility, but it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be fine.\nAnd look at that. Ace of spades. And we roll a d6. And get a 1. Spades with a roll of 1 is feeling “overconfidence,” and reacting to the ace value is “Potreblyat defenses find you.” Yup. We probably set ourselves up for that pretty well in the last one.\nSo yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna check off my little ominous tracker that perhaps will lead to my doom, we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nI mean yeah, we are currently setting up a base in an old Potreblyat base, right? So like, yeah, they found us. We\u0026rsquo;re right there. And I think the overconfidence plays into that super easily, which is that I\u0026rsquo;m just like, yeah. Good luck, you know?\nTrying to think if I want anything more out of that. No, I think it\u0026rsquo;s just gonna be like a little sitrep almost. Yeah, this one happens to just come very naturally from what we\u0026rsquo;ve already established. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of fun.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): Sorry to any of our more distant listeners to pop in unexpectedly in the middle of a song. Listeners who heard alarms start to blare about 15 seconds ago, I think you probably saw it coming.\nAs a relatively public channel, we here at DOOM FM, your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news, take some responsibility for disseminating information in a crisis. Here\u0026rsquo;s what we know.\nYes, there are enforcers at the gates. Don\u0026rsquo;t panic. Of course we wanted more time before the thing we\u0026rsquo;ve been preparing for happened, but we are prepared for it. You know who you should be reporting to and where you should be. You might not know what comes second, but you know what comes first. We all do. Stay calm, stay focused. We are ready for this. In some ways it\u0026rsquo;s ideal: we haven\u0026rsquo;t had time to become complacent yet.\nI am here with you. We are all here together. That\u0026rsquo;s the entire point. We\u0026rsquo;re going to start looping some basic information and as always any breaking news will be proceeded with that god awful beep. You can\u0026rsquo;t miss it.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t fucking miss.\nI promise you.\nSATAH: This is exciting now because technically any pull could be the one that ends the game. Uh, cause we\u0026rsquo;ve got two on the tragedy tracker or whatever.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s pull a card. It\u0026rsquo;s the jack of hearts. Well this is even more incredible because now we are a single card away from either a good ending or a bad ending. Hot damn. Alright.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s roll a d6. Got a three. So feeling hearts three, “friendship”, reacting to a jack is– right, yes. We did this before. “Meeting with peaceful mutant survivors.”\nThere is the option of this being the same survivors, like the band. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s more than that. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s like meeting more of their community because we only met the band before and the feeling I\u0026rsquo;m having is “friendship,” which is great.\nUm, so I think, I mean, we\u0026rsquo;ve established this whole like base. So maybe this is like one of the things that was a plan is that like some of the people who\u0026rsquo;ve been in the Waste, in the Wastes are like moving in or forming some sort of alliance. Like maybe this is right on the edge of town where we are… this base that we took over or whatever it was we took over is on the edge of town. So we\u0026rsquo;re forming like an official sort of alliance and like trade relationship with this group of survivors that\u0026rsquo;s in the Wastes? I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun. I like that. That\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s a, like, that\u0026rsquo;s just a nice positive thing to come from all of this.\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to think– I do want to react properly to the fact that like the last card I pulled was negative. The like defenses finding us and the feeling I was having was specifically “overconfidence,” which I think has to mean there was some amount of hubris or something went wrong. There were greater consequences than we expected in some way. So I might try and find a way to fold that in. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s, uh, the survivors appeared to be like, “Hey, one of the first acts of our alliance or whatever is going to be that we\u0026rsquo;re going to help you rebuild all of the shit that you lost.” ‘Cause I think– I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to give up this base yet because I think it\u0026rsquo;s like fun as a– as a development, but I think that it makes sense that it was harder than we expected and we lost more than we thought we would. And I will in some way, you know, react to that and acknowledge that we\u0026rsquo;re being helped to sort of rebuild, um, as we\u0026rsquo;re forming this relationship, this alliance with a bunch of the survivors from the Waste.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): [Laughing and clapping lightly] Yeah. Oh yeah. Fuck yeah. Thanks again to TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS for gracing us with a set from right here in our studio. We\u0026rsquo;re going to give them a bit of time to recover, but then they\u0026rsquo;ll be popping back in to spend a couple hours co-hosting with yours truly. Don\u0026rsquo;t touch that dial– you absolutely don\u0026rsquo;t want to miss our conversation about adapting instruments to extra fingers, singing with gills, and the hottest new respirator accessories for us normies who die in minutes if we went as deep into the Wastes as they do. We’re glad, all of us, that our climate is not as inhospitable to you and we look forward to figuring out how we can adapt to each other.\nOf course, I have to take this opportunity to yet again thank the Wastelanders currently helping us recover from last week\u0026rsquo;s clash. We all know we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have made it if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t shown up and we are grateful to be in your debt. May we all be blessed to never stop owing each other.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really something to walk the streets and see people building. I know that we… well. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to dwell on the mourning. After all, I am the night host.\n[Sigh]\nMy sincere and immediate apologies for nervously succumbing to the temptation of a pun, but really… I\u0026rsquo;m just excited. The type of excited that makes you want to talk in toasts. To new alliances. To strengthening some walls so you can install doors in others. To a common enemy and to growing beyond them. To you, to me, to us. Especially to us, and to an increasingly expansive definition of the term.\nSpeaking of us, we\u0026rsquo;re all busy, and I\u0026rsquo;m meant to spend my minutes off -air doing some clean up and salvage, as Producer Dag\u0026rsquo;s increasingly blinkless stare is reminding me. So let\u0026rsquo;s just let a few tunes loose in a row, starting with a favourite from our recent acquisitions. This is Lady Gaga with Applause.\nSATAH: It\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible that you can hear the ice cream truck that is outside my house right now. But prior experience with this ice cream truck is that I have no idea when it will leave. So I\u0026rsquo;m not waiting. [Gasp] Oh, there she goes. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the secret. I just have to talk out loud about it. This dispels the magic.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how anybody works in an ice cream truck. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do a crime just having that song playing into my room for the amount of time that it… anyway, this is not relevant. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna pull a card. Okay.\nOh my goodness. Okay. 10 of hearts. It\u0026rsquo;s not over yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s roll a d6. One. Oh my goodness. Feeling “hope.” Reacting to a 10 is “discovered resources.” Hmm.\nOh, this is tough. I\u0026rsquo;m at a place where I feel like the narrative has been wrapping up so cleanly it\u0026rsquo;s like almost frustrating to, like, prolong it? But in a lot of ways, that is the nature of games like this. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s interesting. I think that I\u0026rsquo;m just experiencing impatience because this is for a podcast.\nBut I do want to generally have my eyes toward the end. Like, it could… any pull now could be the second to last pull. So I don\u0026rsquo;t want to open up a bunch of new stuff and have it be like personally unsatisfying. It\u0026rsquo;s totally okay if it is leaving open some narrative possibilities, especially because of the nature of this game being sort of consecutive. That\u0026rsquo;s totally fine. But I want it to feel good for me. So that means that these resources in some way either have to be incredibly inconsequential or they have to be somehow related to what the end is.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve already done a lot of finding music and finding equipment and stuff…\nI think the other thing here is that, like… there\u0026rsquo;s been this whole character arc, you know, where this person has been like, not hopeful and then learned to believe and whatever. And I\u0026rsquo;m starting to be lost on like what is interesting to explore there. So I think that what I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to do is just try and make this like pretty short and inconsequential.\nMm. Another type of entertainment maybe. Like– so we\u0026rsquo;re in this former Potreblyat base of buildings and operations and stuff… I was going to say we found a bunch of reading material and then as I was talking out loud I realised that there\u0026rsquo;s got to be something more specific to that, like to our circumstances.\nAnd so I think what this is going to be is that we have found something that we think could be a resource but we don\u0026rsquo;t have access to it yet. So it\u0026rsquo;s like– not exactly this, but the equivalent of we find a VHS and we know that it\u0026rsquo;s recorded an old commercial that we really want to access, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have a VCR yet. And so I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be discovering information? That\u0026rsquo;s the resource, some sort of information, about, uh– probably the– the… pod, the people who are still in pods? And it\u0026rsquo;s just that we can\u0026rsquo;t decrypt it yet? But I\u0026rsquo;m feeling like we will be able to, you know?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not super inconsequential is it? I kind of talked myself out of that. But I think that ultimately that\u0026rsquo;s more interesting to me and plays, at least plays off of like, what we\u0026rsquo;ve been establishing so far in as much of where we are physically in this new base of ours and stuff.\nAnd maybe it\u0026rsquo;s even just that this is uh, Cel being like, ooh, this information, “We have no idea what this information is, but it could be this. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that be great?” I\u0026rsquo;ll have to sit and think about how much that fits with this character, but… yeah, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a locked vault and this is just Cel sort of going into a poetic mode about what it could be. I feel like that\u0026rsquo;s fair. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like a melancholy, like– it is hope and also it\u0026rsquo;s like, this could be so many things, isn\u0026rsquo;t that so beautiful and doesn’t it– isn\u0026rsquo;t it so tragic that it can\u0026rsquo;t be all of them?\nYou know, yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll find it in the writing. This one took a lot more thought than I expected it to, because I think I really was thinking I would pull a third face card there. Nope, not quite yet. More to– this story has more to say.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): All right, thanks to Damien Rice\u0026rsquo;s Nine Crimes for marking number nine on our top ten list of filing cabinet theories. If you\u0026rsquo;re just tuning in tonight on DOOM FM, your on-the-run station for pre-cataclysm tunes and uncensored news, we\u0026rsquo;re counting down my personal top ten favorite listener guesses on the contents of the filing cabinets that got hauled out of the rubble in the reclaimed compound today.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t seen them myself. We are still, after all, I will gently remind you, an on-the-run station– but I heard all about how the one they forced open released acid that completely dissolved its contents… a concoction so devastating that it didn\u0026rsquo;t even leave behind any helpful clues as to what could be in the others…\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;m caught up in the hype, but come on. We know what Potreblyat is like. They\u0026rsquo;re hoarders. Resources, information, people. They wouldn\u0026rsquo;t rig something to self-destruct unless they couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly risk it falling into someone else\u0026rsquo;s hands. So I\u0026rsquo;m on team “it\u0026rsquo;s gotta be good.”\nSo yes, here is my ninth favourite theory on what\u0026rsquo;s in there: hard drives full of deeply outdated internal blackmail. Thank you to community member T for calling in with this idea. Your joyous cynicism is infectious. There is something so perfectly bleak about the idea that we could do all of the necessary work to safely crack open those cabinets and get leverage on a bunch of corpos who died during the cataclysm, or even just left before everything went to shit.\nI also appreciate the implication that Potreblyat had to have dirt on its employees to keep them, rather than just trapping them the way any machine apparatus with seemingly bottomless funds and morals traps its employees. That would be an exciting new detail.\nIntroducing our number eight pick is Avril Levine with Sk8r Boy. You may think that one\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a stretch because the eight is purely stylistic in the title, but well, as a bit of a teaser, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that it\u0026rsquo;s shockingly relevant to the theory itself.\nHow\u0026rsquo;s that for intrigue?\nWe\u0026rsquo;re truly doing it all here on DOOM FM.\nSATAH: Okay, I took a little break there, and I\u0026rsquo;ve just been considering my options. I think that I\u0026rsquo;m done with this story. And also, this has become very long for a podcast, which I\u0026rsquo;m learning from for the future.\nI am just going to draw until I get a face card. For posterity, here are the cards I\u0026rsquo;m skipping: three of spades, three of diamonds, three of clubs– that\u0026rsquo;s insane– two of hearts, nine of clubs, and I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled a king.\nThis is the king of spades. I\u0026rsquo;m rolling my d6. I\u0026rsquo;m getting a three. So spades three is feeling “surprised.” Yeah, I bet. Reacting to “found by hunters or radicals.”\nSo a king… is ominous. This goes on the ominous tracker. And I think… this is not supposed to be the last entry. Yeah, this is the penultimate entry, which makes me even… I am feeling very confident about my decision to skip a few things because that\u0026rsquo;s going to bring us to 20, which is a nice round number. And it would have been like, what, twenty– I wasn\u0026rsquo;t counting– five?\nSo. Feeling “surprised” after being “found by hunters or radicals.”\nSo the defences have been kicking around… I’m trying to think about what could be surprising here.\nMaybe we\u0026rsquo;ll lean into the radical thing. So it\u0026rsquo;s not like direct Potreblyat forces? It is… members of the community who support them in some way?\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s a like… I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of the entry I wrote that was like, don\u0026rsquo;t be like them… I don\u0026rsquo;t, I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to do a like… ugh, yeah, no, just like politically, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do a like, “the rebels are just as bad as the fascists thing” because that is so played out and boring and a problem.\n[Laughing]\nThere\u0026rsquo;s the idea of like, you know, mutants that are like, “Hey, we should all just go into the wastes and grow extra arms and whatever” but I think that… comes too close to playing into weird disability tropes when like… you know, it\u0026rsquo;s not a one to one, but the way that mutation is, is used in, in media and the things that it sort of like becomes analogous to– because ultimately part of the thing here is that like, I think that these people have these people– like, this is negative, right? So these people have to be wrong. Or rather like the negative could be that it\u0026rsquo;s bad for me in some way, that my character is wrong, but I think that that is too hard to pull off in sort of a short timeline, like, like one or two entries. And so ultimately, these people, whoever they are have to be wrong in some way. And so I want to be really careful about what they represent.\nI should have ended this a little while ago; the amount that I\u0026rsquo;m struggling to come up with like something new that\u0026rsquo;s satisfying shows me that I overextended this narrative a little bit. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m going to get this in this– in this sit down. I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to think on this and maybe just, yeah, start start writing a little and see what happens. I am feeling a little bit, uh, I\u0026rsquo;m feeling kind of stuck. So maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll be back to talk through my process a little more when I when I get there. But for now, just going to have to let it marinate.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): [Far away from the mic] We\u0026rsquo;re back? We\u0026rsquo;re back.\n[On-mic now] We\u0026rsquo;re back. You\u0026rsquo;re, um, this is DOOM FM, your– sorry. We, um. Yeah, um, we apologise for the interruption of the broadcast. That\u0026rsquo;s never, um… happened before. We’ve… you can tell, taken control of the signal again, but it\u0026rsquo;s… well, it\u0026rsquo;s always exciting to find new areas that can be improved, right? New…\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t, um, we can\u0026rsquo;t disclose, you know, all of the details of the tech, but we\u0026rsquo;re… well, we have, we have control of the signal again. And… sorry, I don\u0026rsquo;t, I don\u0026rsquo;t, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I can do this. If they can take over the waves and they can sound like me? I can\u0026rsquo;t.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not so bad, the behind the scenes work, right? I don\u0026rsquo;t have to– I don\u0026rsquo;t have to leave. I can just… Dag– can you? I\u0026rsquo;m sorry– I thought I could– then it started talking in my fucking voice. It\u0026rsquo;s like they waited to deploy that until they knew they were about to lose control– anyway, I just wasn\u0026rsquo;t, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expect–\nSorry, listeners. Um, I\u0026rsquo;m, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to play something and then, um. Sorry. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\nSATAH: Wow, I had really rough writer\u0026rsquo;s block with that last one. I\u0026rsquo;m not– I don\u0026rsquo;t have the dates in front of me. For some reason it didn\u0026rsquo;t like save properly, um, or show up as, as modified looking at the “when this file was last modified” and it\u0026rsquo;s saying the date that I first started using it, which is not accurate. I know that I\u0026rsquo;ve recorded in it since then. But it took a couple of weeks or at least a week to sort of chew through how I wanted that to end or, or, or the point– that sort of climactic point.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m satisfied with it? It helped– I went back and, um, you know, this, this recording, this, this process, this game has– has taken a while. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing for over a month, um, various life circumstances, and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t like reread the other entries in a while. And so after a truly embarrassing and slightly uncharacteristic number of false starts trying to just sit down and bang out that entry, today I sat down and reread all of the other entries and I… I had a…\nLast night as I was going to sleep– I\u0026rsquo;ve been, you know, like rotating this thing; I returned to it a couple of times a day for the past while. And then last night, just as I was going to bed, my brain did a like, “Ooh, ‘surprise.’ What if, what if the surprises that they call, you know, like someone from Potreblyat calls.” And so I went back and I, I reread all of the entries to see if there was something in them that would sort of point towards that.\nAnd ultimately I was like, I think that if they called, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be allowed on the air to give the threat? And I think I really wanted– this, this– I’ve really enjoyed this medium of like writing the banter and, but, but as I think I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about in a few of these, you know, card pull segments, uh, it\u0026rsquo;s been a little strange sometimes to try and communicate both like events that happened and be realistic about how someone would talk on the radio– on their highly illegal pirate radio station. And so I wanted it– I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to give them a chance to talk around it as I have with some of the other events, like give them time to calm down and get into a place where they can speak euphemistically about it, you know? Where they can get to a point where they\u0026rsquo;re like, Hey, well, we all know what happened and blah, blah, blah. I wanted them to be genuinely surprised and feel that emotional reaction happen sort of in real time.\n‘Cause I think that was part of the block for me was, was like being like, how do I make this– how do I do this? How do I do “surprise” for this specific event? Anyway. I bet in a while I will be happy with that. Right now. I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a little bit like, well, okay. It\u0026rsquo;s not bad. It\u0026rsquo;s not bad, but I bet that I\u0026rsquo;ll feel better about it in the future than I do in this moment.\nAnd with that, we are going to pull our f– last card. I nearly said our finalest card, which, I guess– bringing us to a nice even 20 entries. Oh my god.\nOur last card is an eight of clubs. And then we roll a D6. Got a four. So four on clubs is “fear.” Yeah, I bet. And reacting to– eight is “secrets of Potreblyat revealed.” Oh no.\n[Laughing] I\u0026rsquo;m sad. I\u0026rsquo;m sad. I like this character. And– like they had such an arc of, uh, learning to trust and stay put… it\u0026rsquo;s really awful to have to end it on a bad note, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s the rules. I\u0026rsquo;m fairly sure that, you know, if you hit three kings or aces first, it has to be a bad ending. If you do three queens or jacks first, it can be a good ending.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t wanna… [Laughing] I don’t wanna. I want them to be okay.\nSo part of the problem is, you know, obviously in that entry, what they sort of, you know, talked about– like the gentle version of it, right, is, um, like they just retire. Is that enough? I think, ugh– so I think maybe what this– format-wise, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that they\u0026rsquo;ll do another show after that, you know? Like I think it\u0026rsquo;s just too much. And so I think that this should be either they\u0026rsquo;re calling in or leaving a recording in the studio.\nAnd I think… I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want it to be as straightforward– like, they\u0026rsquo;re certainly not going to go just like– there is a world, I guess, in which they just go and they\u0026rsquo;re like, Hey, I\u0026rsquo;ve been so much of a threat if, if I just give myself to Potreblyat they will actually stop being so threatening. Um, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think that that\u0026rsquo;s who they are realistically. And so I think it makes sense for them to leave. You know, like they don\u0026rsquo;t just retire. They, they head back out into the Wastes. And then we can, you know, think maybe sometime in the future, TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS or whatever the fuck I named that band and their little merry crew of Wastelanders can, can pick them up. And that\u0026rsquo;s nice to think about in the future maybe.\nBut um, yeah, I think I like the idea of it being a call, um, that can be sort of verified, you know, like they, they have… private things set up that off the air, they like verify that this is actually Cel calling in.\nIn reading the old entries, I realised I have been correct about the name Celebration Establishment. They introduce themselves at one point.\nUm, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s even they call in and they aren\u0026rsquo;t expecting to be put on the air, but the new night host just does it. Kind of to be an asshole to be like “What, you\u0026rsquo;re leaving? No, guess what? You\u0026rsquo;re doing one final show, just for a few seconds.” and I\u0026rsquo;ll have to figure out what the secrets are.\nSo they find something out and that\u0026rsquo;s the reason they\u0026rsquo;re leaving. Like this is, it\u0026rsquo;s been a little while. They\u0026rsquo;ve just been living in the community. They find something out and they\u0026rsquo;re like, I gotta dip. I can\u0026rsquo;t do this actually.\nUm, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Maybe we don\u0026rsquo;t even find out. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll think about it and I\u0026rsquo;ll come up with something and then, you know, in the writing I\u0026rsquo;ll figure out what they\u0026rsquo;re reacting to. But maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just like… something\u0026rsquo;s too much. And I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to define what it is. We\u0026rsquo;ll see. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): [Echoing slightly] Don\u0026rsquo;t put me on the air. I was just calling to… alright. Fuck. Fuck. Uh, fine. Let me turn my radio down.\n[Echo stops]\nOkay. Listeners, hello. As Con said, this transmission has been verified. It\u0026rsquo;s really me.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while. I, uh… I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting to talk to you. It, uh, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s the opinion of the DOOM ROOM that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t leave without saying goodbye. That was my entire plan, but I had to give Con a couple of codes that only I know and, well…\nIs throwing me on the air one last time a guilt trip or a threat? It\u0026rsquo;s not gonna make me stay. I\u0026rsquo;m not\u0026hellip;\nLook, I wish someone else were telling you this because they\u0026rsquo;d be able to give you more of the story, but here we are. My story, my responsibility, I guess– though now, how much do we know about how much control I\u0026rsquo;ve had over… ooh, I need to keep this short.\nMy unplug was planned. “Schedule of people we’re going to release into the real-real on purpose for whatever nefarious plot” wasn\u0026rsquo;t in any of the filing cabinet theories, but there are a lot of things we didn\u0026rsquo;t predict. So yes, I\u0026rsquo;m leaving. You can argue behind my back for as long as you want about whether I\u0026rsquo;m doing exactly what they want me to do, but I can\u0026rsquo;t– I can\u0026rsquo;t risk that there\u0026rsquo;s something inside of me that they put there that will wake up one day and put all of you in more danger than I already have, just by nature of the other things inside of me. The me inside of me, the voice, the history, the stature, I can\u0026rsquo;t do it anymore. I\u0026rsquo;m going to…\nOh, shit. Fuck. Uh, searchlights. Skyguards. I, uh… I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry, and thank you all for declaring me an acceptable risk, and I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry that I think you were wrong.\nOkay, I gotta try… shit.\nUm, take, take care of them, Con– please just, please just take care of them–\nHB (AS SHERRIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you? You’re flopping boneless on the ground, shaking with reality pains as a Potreblyat liaison tells you, “Sir, we\u0026rsquo;ve raised the rates on true reality in light of recent network issues, and you no longer qualify for the basic package. We\u0026rsquo;re sorry for the inconvenience.”\nAnd do you complain? No! Your spouse wasn\u0026rsquo;t real anyhow, and neither were the kids. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford any to get plugged in.\nWell, I says to Gosh, “I want to join the revolution.” Gosh says, “Hang on there, brother, that\u0026rsquo;s not how this works. You still got the shakes and can barely keep the soup down. I say, “It\u0026rsquo;s my right as a free-thinking individual to lay down my life for the cause anyway. We’ve been listening to Doom FM nightly, and there\u0026rsquo;s talk of action, explosions, rebellion.”\n“Hang on there, brother,” Gosh says. “Those are from ten years ago. It\u0026rsquo;s personal tapes from the golden days. DOOM FM\u0026rsquo;s been off the air for years now.”\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah, and I\u0026rsquo;m showcasing multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together. This is episode 3 of our game of Unplugged Survivor, a game by We Are Heroes Productions and the Tabletop for the End of the World podcast. With me for real this time are Darling Demon Eclipse and Happy Birthday. Check out Eclipse at Eclipse.Gay, especially her recent sci-fi romance duet TTRPG, Biotrophication, and check out HB at gm36.itch.io.\nLast week you got a little teaser for HB\u0026rsquo;s character, and I, like, cannot overemphasize how thrilled I was with their contribution. I had no idea what to expect when I handed my absurd teetering pile of entries to someone else to build something from or build on top of, and they created something that is like unbelievably fun, to the extent that when I first read them I had to, like, get up and walk in little circles a little bit to expend some of my excited energy. That\u0026rsquo;s how pumped I was. And I want you to get into it. I want to stop stalling so that I can get you to the story that I\u0026rsquo;m so excited about instead of doing this, vamping, and stalling, rambling, I\u0026rsquo;m excited! Oh no! It\u0026rsquo;s counterproductive!\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m gonna hand you off to HB as they do their character creation. Just one last note: because my run ended up a little bit longer than I felt totally comfortable asking guests to do for the show, we added an optional modification to the rules, which is that while the book asks you to play until you pull three face cards in either category, so that\u0026rsquo;s up to five face cards, HB is playing to three face cards in total.\nGAME: HB HB: Hi there. HB here. I\u0026rsquo;ve just freshly listened to Satah\u0026rsquo;s lovely recordings of Celebration Establishment’s rise and fall in the radio industry. Or rise and subsequent rise, if you prefer to think of it that way. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been going through this text and seeing what I need to actually create here.\nAs before, we\u0026rsquo;re playing in a post-apocalyptic dystopia. As before, we are generating our character by choosing a positive, negative, and neutral personality trait. We have found the journal of the… we have found the journal of, say, this previous character who is, you know, Celebration Establishment, that said Radio DJ. And we need to figure out where to go from here.\nSo there are several options for how this could potentially work. The idea of this game is that you get the journal and then you use the knowledge from it to proceed forward. And I\u0026rsquo;m wondering about making a character who, you know, maybe isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily doing a very good job of things. Certainly not a successful radio DJ or anything.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assign them some traits first of all, following the character creation order from the book. Hard working, I think, is appropriate. As for the neutral personality trait, I think I\u0026rsquo;d like to be high-spirited. And as for our negative personality trait, we have things like, you know, abrasive, destructive, foolish, reactive, rowdy, vulnerable. I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go for foolish. I\u0026rsquo;d love to play a foolish character. Being a character who\u0026rsquo;s kind of a dipshit is one of my favourite things in the world.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s their story? Who were they when they were plugged in? A politician, business person, athlete, medical professional? I think my person was essentially like a store clerk, not somebody who\u0026rsquo;s like a big deal in the True Reality. Somebody who, if there was a payment plan for being plugged into the True Reality, then, you know, they definitely were on the lowest tier. In fact, I think they were on such a low tier that I don\u0026rsquo;t think any of their loved ones were real. They were just, you know, little computer constructs that responded in predictable ways to whatever he was saying to them. So in a sense, either they\u0026rsquo;re still alive or they never were alive to begin with.\nI think they\u0026rsquo;ve been unplugged fairly recently and I think they\u0026rsquo;ve been unplugged by the Potreblyat Corporation themselves, specifically as their infrastructure deteriorates and they can\u0026rsquo;t support as many people anymore. So it was, in a sense, sort of a voluntary process. They weren\u0026rsquo;t just like, you know, casually– they didn\u0026rsquo;t just get released by accident. They were just essentially cut loose.\nSo yeah, have they regained some strength before starting their journal or are they fresh out? I think they\u0026rsquo;re fairly fresh out, maybe like a week out as they start their journal.\nWhat else do we need? They probably need a name. Let me find– let me see if I can randomly generate one. Satah has a very interesting naming convention here, just using two words and I fortunately have a random name generator just for that purpose. Let\u0026rsquo;s go for Michael Fogelman\u0026rsquo;s random phrase generator. Let\u0026rsquo;s see, let\u0026rsquo;s see, let\u0026rsquo;s see, let\u0026rsquo;s see. We got… Sheriff Easy. [Laughing] Honestly, Sheriff Easy might be good. Okay, Sheriff Easy it is.\nWe are entering into the adventures, into the life and times of Sheriff Easy They are hardworking, high spirited, and foolish.\nSo yeah, I think we\u0026rsquo;re ready to go proceed to the card pulls.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s gonna be the Queen of Diamonds and a six. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at our beautiful little oracle. Betrayal. And because this is the Queen, we are “meeting up with the rebels.” So as soon as we draw three face cards, the game is going to, you know, come to a close. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s maybe kind of auspicious that we\u0026rsquo;ve already drawn our first one. Now if my experience playing The Ground Itself is any indication, that is no indication of further success. However, I choose to interpret it optimistically anyway.\nSo we have “betrayal” and we have the rebels. I think our guy Sheriff Easy is going to have a hard time adjusting to life outside of the True Reality and he\u0026rsquo;s going to fall in with the rebels but feel betrayed by the progress they have made. I have an idea for how to write this.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYou’re flopping boneless on the ground, shaking with reality pains as a Potreblyat liaison tells you, “Sir, we\u0026rsquo;ve raised the rates on True Reality in light of recent network issues and you no longer qualify for the basic package. We\u0026rsquo;re sorry for the inconvenience.” And do you complain? No! Your spouse wasn\u0026rsquo;t real anyway and neither were the kids. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford any to get plugged in! It happens more and more.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a week out and convalescing on borrowed soup in the place of the local man with answers. His name\u0026rsquo;s Gosh. Good guy. He says a body like me turns up every week, freshly cut loose. Maintenance can\u0026rsquo;t cover them anymore. Wild stuff, I tell you.\nWell I says to Gosh. “I want to join the revolution.”\nGosh says, “Hang on there, brother, that\u0026rsquo;s not how this works. You still got the shakes and you barely keep the soup down.”\nAnd I say, “It\u0026rsquo;s my right as a free thinking individual to lay down my life for the cause. Anyway, we\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to Doom FM nightly and there\u0026rsquo;s talk of action, explosions, rebellion. I want to do my part, you know?”\n“Hang on there, brother,” Gosh says. “Those are from ten years ago. It\u0026rsquo;s personal tapes from the golden days. Doom FM\u0026rsquo;s been off the air for years now. Context Edition works for Potreblyat now and Celebration Establishment\u0026rsquo;s been replicated to two thousand times or so since that big voice model debacle.”\n“Well shit,” I says to him. But ain\u0026rsquo;t that always the way? The hard times just used to go so much harder. The broadcasts would be interrupted by real explosions. They have real mutants coming in doing guest spots. They don\u0026rsquo;t have any of that anymore. Doom FM was it, man.\nAnyway, we\u0026rsquo;re looking through the tapes, seeing if we can make something of them. There\u0026rsquo;s twenty Gosh can confidently say are bona fides. No fakery about them. Just pure Celebration Establishment. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can reclaim the soul of the struggle.\nHB: Okay let\u0026rsquo;s see what we have here. That is the five of diamonds and the die roll is a three. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s see what this means. Diamonds and– yeah, three. “Hatred.” Oh boy. Five. “Discovered knowledge about the world.” Oh dear. Oh dear.\nSo yeah, “the world” in this case would be the city and the areas beyond? Like what\u0026rsquo;s happened out there in the wasteland? I think, you know… there\u0026rsquo;s probably a, uh– considering that hatred is the theme here, I think probably Sheriff Eazy will have discovered, you know, that the situation is less hopeful than one might think.\nI feel like there is quite a lot of, uh– you know how there was a sort of air of solidarity and helpfulness in general like in general struggle about the place? I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of gone now. I think there\u0026rsquo;s been– I think there\u0026rsquo;s probably been a schism or two and there\u0026rsquo;s definitely quite a lot of– I think the fighting is ongoing but in a more undirected sort of way. So yeah, I think Sheriff Easy and Gosh are gonna have to square themselves with this knowledge a little bit. You know; get to know what the world around them is.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYou\u0026rsquo;re looking for hardware. Reasonable hardware, consumer grade hardware, just a little battery or processing units help you extract a soul– classic stuff. And they say– you know who they are and you know how they are– “What are you planning, friend?”\nAnd you say, “Well, comrade, I don\u0026rsquo;t see how that’s any business of yours,” and they say, “Well, you can\u0026rsquo;t have it then. Processing batteries are vital to the safety of the community and we can\u0026rsquo;t just load computing time out like that in a time of crisis.”\nCrisis! Beh! It’s not even Potreblyat they’re fighting, but the Simulationists, the Hunters, the Free Radicals, the Determinist Radicals, the Pacifists, the Gaming Commission and even the Reality Party, who call THEM the Other Revolution. And that’s not even getting into the mutants, who have their own parties that Gosh doesn’t know a damn thing about.\nWell… screw them. I’m heading out into the wastes. I’ve gathered my strength, or what’s left of it, and I’ve copied down the twenty recordings into a handy-dandy thumb drive. Advanced stuff! I’ll try my luck with the mutants– can’t be any worse than the fools in this city. They’re gonna be sorry when I return. Oh boy, they’ll be sorry!\nHB: Okay. We had some initial adventures and now we\u0026rsquo;re heading down to the wasteland. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what we\u0026rsquo;ll find. That is a seven of diamonds. A real diamond-rich game so far. Okay. Oh that\u0026rsquo;s a three again– more “hatred.” Okay, seven. “Usable technology found.”\nOh boy. Our boy Sheriff Easy is gonna have a good time out there in the destroyed and ruined environs of the city. But, you know. He\u0026rsquo;s found something. Now is that gonna be a good thing? Probably not in the long run. We\u0026rsquo;ll definitely see about, you know, finding out how that shakes out for him. And I think he\u0026rsquo;s almost ready to start work on the process of extracting the soul of Celebration Establishment. You know, for better or for worse.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYou’re leaving the city - the City! The city beneath the city, the underreality of the True Reality, for the very first time. You’ve heard the mutational frequency spikes where the remnants of the city shielding start to fail, but what of it? Your body’s a wormlike aggregation of hairless gray flesh anyway, what’s a little mutation in the face of that?\nMost everyone this far out who still claims some connection to the city lives in a bunker. Doom FM used to broadcast from a network of them! Walking in the footsteps of my forebears, am I right? Gosh and me made a little shielded box for the thumb drive, keep it safe from magnetic storms. Keep my recorder in there also, take it out only for special occasions.\nAnd oh boy, what an occasion! You see, I found me a node, a little slice of True Reality all to myself. Offline now, naturally. Potreblyat’s been истреблен around these parts for yonks now. Radiation shielding’s been blown out, everybody’s gone. Even the mutants don’t come close - they think the place is haunted. Well, fuck ‘em! Their loss is my gain: some of this stuff still works! Or could work.\nWell. I’ve been sleeping in the closet here for a week now, going through my supplies. This is primo hardware we have here. Bet I could feed Celly right into this with some work.\nHB: Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s see where this story takes us next. The nine of hearts. Okay. And the die roll is four. So hearts is “surprise” and nine is “surprise help.” Oh dear. Oh, this could be good.\nWhat could– what kind of help could our friend Sheriff Easy find in this little Potreblyat node? What surprise help could he obtain? Uh, hmm. Maybe he finds a little friend among the systems. Some sort of lingering little device? Maybe like a user\u0026rsquo;s manual, something of that nature? It could be like an intelligence, but I think that would– I think the user\u0026rsquo;s manual would probably translate a little better.\nSo yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll give this some thought and then get to work on the journal entry.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYou’ve never done much software work in the past but had to learn to code a little because it was just the done thing, but now you’re sitting in a disused computer centre perusing the operations manual of True Reality itself! What an honour! There’s a switch to flip, a process to activate, a failed network connection to get around, and what do you see? A subfunction called “Reality Assistant”, and you think to yourself, I do need some assistance in my reality. You press it, and the system goes “Hi! I see you’re attempting to deduce a human consciousness from minimal materials! Would you like some assistance?”\nWell damn right I would. Been weeks since I spoke to a human being. Still is, actually! Been relistening to the Celly tapes in the meantime. Such a smooth voice. Anyway, Reality Assistant doesn’t sound nothing like that. More of a “hi!” or a “hiiii!” or when the magnetic storms kick up, a “h-h-h-h-hiiiiiiiii there”. Helpful though! I’m making progress getting the stuff working!\nAt first I was like, well, probably this thing’s recording all my responses. That’s no good. But then the network connection’s kaput, so there’s nowhere to send them. So now I’m like, aw, it remembers what I say! No idea what it does with any of it. Sometimes asks me to fill out surveys, too. I like the surveys, honestly. Reminds me of the Sunday crossword. Ten across, has anyone recently approached you about forming a software workers’ union? I just smile and write in no, nobody has. Reality Assistant seems happy about that.\nAnyway, we’re a ways from getting Celly working, but I have backed up the thumb drive into the system! There’s a little room in there now where the twenty recordings play on loop. I’ve got a little 2D Celly rotating in there too. It’s not the soul of the revolution or nothing, but it’s a start!\nHB: Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s see. Ooh, the queen of spades! This is quite interesting, because that means we\u0026rsquo;re already on our second face card. This might actually turn out to be quite a short game. On the other hand, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee that we\u0026rsquo;re going to draw another card. We\u0026rsquo;re already at 2 out of 3, so\u0026hellip; well, let\u0026rsquo;s find out what goes on.\nSo, spades and 4? Ooh, “strength!” And the queen is “meet up with the rebels.” Ooh, the rebels are gonna… rebels are gonna make another appearance. That\u0026rsquo;s fascinating.\nSo, I feel like in the previous journal entry I alluded to rebel factions that do not necessarily… that do not necessarily agree with the idea of, like, uh– you know… that people should have individual consciousnesses, and I think this is sort of what I\u0026rsquo;m about to encounter. Maybe like a faction of the Simulationists or something of that nature.\nThis promises to be potentially quite funny. Are things gonna really work out fo Sheriff Easy? It\u0026rsquo;s looking more likely by the minute.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYou’ve found yourself in the blissfully irradiated ruins of Potreblyat’s past glory and your third eye’s opening up– literally, you have three eyes now. With your vertiginous and depthy perception– feels a little bit like you’re seeing the future in the present, really, but even more disorienting than that if you can believe it– you are not the least bit surprised when you are found. Big lads in big protective suits with big smiles and big guns. “Comrade”, they say, “We have heard of your vaunted, haunted work and we approve. How can we help?”\nThey call themselves the New Reality, and I don’t really know if they’re Simulationists or Reality Party really, but they think this whole Celly plan is great, which is the most affirming thing anybody’s ever said to me. Even Gosh didn’t believe in me like these guys do! They’re loving the little True Reality node I’ve got going. They even like Reality Assistant, though Reality Assistant keeps calling them unauthorized users and what have you.\nAnyway, I got a staff now! A little Doom FM all my own. Computer technicians! Advanced electrics! They even offered me a protective suit and I just winked with my third eye and said, well, it’s a bit late for that now, innit. I got limb buds all over this body of mine now, and I can eat most kinds of bug raw and not even get a stomachache. Times are good!\nBut I’m burying the lede here– the real milestone this time is my new compadres have got a rudimentary personality matrix working. Celly - my Celly, my very own Celly, not tapes Celly– is now talking a little bit! They’re saying things like [Robotic Cel voice joining in in the background] “What? Hello? No! No! No!” now and we’re looking to see what’s going on with that last part. Maybe sanitize the room they’re in a little? Make the vibes more pleasant.\nHB: Alright. No whammies. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. What\u0026rsquo;s the next card we\u0026rsquo;re gonna draw? A five of hearts… and that\u0026rsquo;s a two. What does two for hearts mean? Oh, “love.” And five is… “discover new knowledge about the world.”\n“Love” and “discover new knowledge about the world.” Okay. Yeah.\nI think Sheriff Easy is learning a lot about, you know, about himself and about the world around him as he\u0026rsquo;s in this latter part of working on his little model of Celebration Establishment, trying to extract the soul of the revolution. I think he\u0026rsquo;s settled into a pleasant rhythm, and I think… by this he is going to, I think, most likely, you know, become something of a, uh– probably– let\u0026rsquo;s say that he\u0026rsquo;s, you know. He\u0026rsquo;s getting a bit– he\u0026rsquo;s a nostalgic man by his very nature, but I think he\u0026rsquo;s also, I think he\u0026rsquo;s also learning a bit more about the world around him from the people he\u0026rsquo;s now sharing the space in. These, like, New Reality people. And I think he\u0026rsquo;s going to synthesize this into some kind of… synthesize this into some kind of idea about the world, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is precisely yet, but I do know that it involves One Direction.\nSo yeah. Be back soon with the journal entry.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYou’re getting lost in the sauce of extracting a radio DJ’s soul from a series of bonafide recordings and wondering about the vision of it all. Where did it all go wrong for the revolution? We– you know, and I use the generous “we” here– used to all want the same thing. We used to all be together. Well, I mean, the Determinist Radicals were always a splinter faction, but you know, generally speaking. We were– if you’ll pardon a middle-aged man his nostalgia– a supergroup, long before any one member of the group had become a superstar worthy of that fame.\nAnd I say, why can’t we recapture that original spirit? Why can’t we all be pointed in One Direction again? And the boys say amen to that. We need to be reconstructing the reality where that can be. A newer, truer Reality, as they call it. One where Celly’s the icon they deserve to be, and Doom FM still runs, and Potreblyat’s been ground to dust, and reality itself is at our feet. Actualized in the now. Opened up in a new and better timeline.\nSo we’re getting the band back together. Most of the Doom FM staff don’t have copies on file, legally or illegally, so we’re improvising. Adding some artistic licence. The boys have dossiers on most of them, and the entries give us some of the emotional context. They’re looking to me to get the details– my third eye tastes the emotional nuance, fires up centres of my brain.\nAnd, well, we’re already seeing some results! Our Celly’s a lot less disoriented now. We’re running them through the scenarios, and we got our first one down pat without scripting just yesterday. Big stuff, lemme tell you! I think we’re getting to something real here. Sorting out the Zayn Malik, if you will. Approaching unity.\nHB: Okay, we are in the danger zone now. Any next card could be it. An eight of spades. And let\u0026rsquo;s roll the die. One. Eight of spades is “overconfidence.” And eight is “secrets of Potreblyat revealed.” Okay, alright.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s time to get into the spirit of the… all that voice model stuff from the previous set of journal entries, I think we\u0026rsquo;re gonna get deeper into that in this journal entry. See about, like, uh… because I think the… Sheriff Easy and his new friends are going to start really messing around with the voice model copies. Maybe like analyze some of the… maybe start pulling on Celebration Establishment\u0026rsquo;s existing models, or pull out like Context Edition’s models, or like one of the other ones. And we\u0026rsquo;re just gonna… we\u0026rsquo;re gonna start really getting to the weeds of this reality situation. It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a… well…iIt\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a fucking horror show.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYou spent your whole life in True Reality but you never really gave much thought to what’s real and what’s not. Now that you’re out, you’re realising that more and more of what you know might not be real at all. Fake people are all over the damn place now. Can’t go ten steps without a Celebration Establishment asking what you have been doing for your skin health and your country lately.\nSATAH (AS CELEBRATION ESTABLISHMENT): What have you been doing for your skin health and your country lately?\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): More and more there’s no way of knowing where and when you really are, or who anyone is. Who are you? Who are you really?\nWell, I’m Easy. No one’s bothered to copy me yet, but hey, maybe you’ll be the first? We’ve been getting into the weeds into the Potreblyat Personality Project files they leaked a few years back. Wild stuff! They had the inside line on a few of the Doom FM bunker studios and we’re using those to instantiate different models of staff and, of course, Celly themself from the materials left behind in their True Reality days. It’s been useful in improving the fidelity of our Celly, getting some of that real shit in there.\nWe also got the model of Producer Dag in there. They had the technical specs and the image included in the leak. It really settles Celly down when you get them in there, gets our beloved DJ on task like nothing else, but Dag’s a bit… unruly, I guess. Shut down our room a couple of times already. Says let them out or they sink the whole thing. That’s been a real pain in the ass, so we’ve been working on our own Dag, who’s got less of that… Dag-ness, I guess, but that’s not a bad thing, right? Real Doom FM fell apart, after all, so me and the boys been brainstorming how to make one that doesn’t. Maybe Dag’s where we start?\nBoy, it really feels like we’re headed into the undiscovered country now. The mood’s real excited at our camp. Most of my boys have stopped wearing their suits. I feel like they look up to me!\nHB: Okay. The deeper we go, the more brutal this is bound to get. Let\u0026rsquo;s draw that card. That\u0026rsquo;s a nine of spades. And a one. So, we are continuing on the theme of “overconfidence.” And the nine here is “surprise help.” Oh, boy, we\u0026rsquo;re continuing to get a lot of surprising help here. Hmm, who could this be?\n“Surprise help” in this case probably means not exactly, like, uh… or– hm. For “confidence”, I think this would be, you know, further revolutionary factions joining our cause. Or maybe even, you know, non-revolutionary factions joining our cause. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, like the Gaming Commission or one of those.\nSo, hmm, who could this be? Who could be a surprising source of help? Or maybe one of the– hmm. Okay, yeah.\nI think the overconfidence comes from this being an actual old Doom FM person that the, uh, that our guys have found. We\u0026rsquo;ll see what they make of this situation.\nAlright, back to journaling for me.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYour strident belief in the human soul has been tested many times over by fiddling with the personality coding of a gaggle of barely coordinated radio producers and personalities. The boys mean well, but are getting impatient– you’ve thrown out several fondly remembered revolutionaries simply for failing to get with the program. You gotta keep making more! Newer! Better guys to put in there! You’re moving off target! What’s a guy to do?\nWell, I’ll tell you what: the boys heard word that Situation Equipment, long on the run since the big boom three years back, was sighted off in mutant country. Well, a weeklong trip later Situation’s right here, bound up and uncooperative. I sat down with them and said, “Sit, may I call you Sit, I’ll just call you Sit, why don’t you just relax– you’re the corporate expert and you know all about the Personality Project by now, so why I don’t I just give you the skinny: we got Celly, we got a reasonable approximation of most of the others, so we’re relaunching Doom FM, the way it was meant to be. Get the DOOM ROOM together again.”\nAnd friend, let me tell you, the FEAR in those eyes. I was kinda hurt! We just need some consulting done. Get some firsthand reports of the years before, the years after. Help us contextualise the events some, confirm or deny the reality of some things that may or may not have happened. I think, personally, there was something going on between Dag and Pursuant Technology, but there’s just no way to know from the record alone.\nWell. Sit told me to go fuck myself. Well! It’s like you don’t even know someone from how they are on the radio. Rest assured there’ll be interrogations to come.\nHB: Back at it again. Let\u0026rsquo;s draw a card. So, six of hearts. Let me roll the die. Six. Ooh. “Joy” and “a mutated creature appears.” Oh, good. Very good. Hmm. [Devious giggle]\nHa. A thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about for quite a bit is how to… is see if we can tie TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS back into this. And I think this might be the perfect opportunity. Or if not TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS, then at least some other mutated creature.\nI think we\u0026rsquo;re about to start really messing with this virtual world. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I think I have enough.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nThe boys are in a bit of a slump, and the New Reality’s starting to get really old. You’re blasting the Best Song Ever as you’re trying to get morale back up, but the project’s hit a standstill for now. It’s time to look out there, see what’s going on. What do the people need? What people do we need? And just when the mood seems lowest, something beautiful comes along. Someone wonderful.\nNo, literally Someone Wonderful. That’s her name. She’s a mutant– you know the type, six legs, huge diaphanous wings– only two arms, pretty unusual. She does a TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS tribute act with some of her friends, remembering the beauty of being killed and coming back again in her own special way. She and her bandmates came in and let me tell you, mood around the camp has lightened considerably. I think the boys were beginning to realise they weren’t coming back from this assignment looking like they are. Too many eyes for New Reality HQ to countenance.\nAnyway. She played for us the whole weekend, first live music any of us have heard. We danced and moshed and sang, and we felt the strength returning to our bodies, our resolve hardening once more. The feasting’s done us a world of good.\nIn return for this incredible kindness she’d shown us we offered to record her tracks with our recording equipment, cut a mixtape of TOXOPLASYMBIOSIS tracks by her and the crew. Maybe even some original material? She was overjoyed! And so were we– soon after she left, we added her tracks to the internal DOOM FM rotation. Vibes were instantly improved! We’ll experiment some more, but this seems like a breath of fresh air.\nHB: We begin again. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if this is gonna be the one. Ooh, queen of clubs! Queen of clubs! That\u0026rsquo;s three! That\u0026rsquo;s three queens! Oh my god, the game is over! And we get a good ending! Holy shit! Oh my god, oh my christ. This did not take nearly as long as I would think.\nLet me just roll this dice right quick. Six. So six of clubs is “remorse”. Ooh. So we “meet up with the rebels” and we feel “remorse.” Hmm. Okay. Yeah.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ve developed a kind of connection here. Like, against all odds, Sheriff Easy has survived, so. And… we are gonna meet up with the rebels and we\u0026rsquo;re gonna see like– some sort of decisive conflict happens here, because the rebels are… not necessarily friendly to us in this final confrontation. But I do think there\u0026rsquo;s gonna be… hmm. Hmm. Does Sheriff Easy finally realise that we don\u0026rsquo;t need a DOOM FMin the future? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that\u0026rsquo;s the case. Or at least I don\u0026rsquo;t think he fully abandons the work. But I think the sort of hopeful tone of the previous journal entry definitely leads into what happens next here. Which is, you know, maybe he regrets sticking this close to the city for this long? Or maybe something else happens?\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna have to give this a good long think. Jesus christ. Ten entries. And that\u0026rsquo;s it. Well, I guess this will be easy to listen to at least.\nHB (AS SHERIFF EASY): Has this ever happened to you?\nYour house is in order at last, and your Celly’s bopping in the recording booth to the new mutant tunes you’ve been scoring off an ever-increasing network of people who heard the boys up on the haunted hill will feast and favour those who come with music and reward them with precious mixtapes playable on all devices in the land. Celly knows the attention brings explosions, gunfights, sabotage, maybe even Potreblyat themselves eventually. You know, if they cared at all. You’ve been fighting off weekly raids from the City– some of them enemies of New Reality, some of them New Reality themselves who think your hardware could be put to better use in their other projects.\nWell, they got what they wanted after a fashion: we’re leaving. Me and the boys. Deeper into the Waste Land. We’ve been asking the visiting mutants about safe places, and we’ve found a veritable cornucopia of haunted and forsaken places out there– well, that’s our favourite kind of place, I says to the mutant scouts. We’ve started stripping all the equipment from camp and we’re getting ready for a long trek. Quite a few people are coming out to help!\nHard to say if this Celly project is gonna do any good. What good is there to be done? I don’t think it’ll ever be fit for wider release, but damn if it didn’t feel good working on it. We’re taking them along, them and DOOM FM. Situation’s asked us to destroy the whole thing, and well, I mean, we said no. We did release them in the end– Situation, I mean. Sent their friends word to pick them up, and a copy of our work in case they decide it’s good after all. A little instance of DOOM FM, the on-the-run radio reality for post-cataclysmic tunes and only good news.\nIf you’re listening to this, you’ve got your hands on some version of the little station we built. Whatever you think of it, whatever you make of it, understand this: we may not have extracted the soul of Celebration Establishment, but I think we found a little something in this dim reflection from a bygone time. If you think it’s good, thank you all for declaring us an acceptable risk. And if you think it’s evil, well, thank you for listening. Sorry if we were wrong.\nThis has been Sheriff Easy, and you were never listening to DOOM FM.\nHB: This is half the length of the previous playthrough, but I think I got a good kick out of playing it. Honestly did not expect this story to take the twists that it did. I always knew that I was going to, you know… do some pretty… contrary stuff to what Celebration Establishment would have wanted, but I think the– I think where it ultimately went was simultaneously kind of a happier ending than I thought it would have? I was fully prepared for this man to get shot to death by security forces or something like that, but I think as it stands, I think it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be alright. He\u0026rsquo;s made it out. He has survived. He has become very different from what he used to be, but I think, you know, his hardworking nature and incredibly high spirit has carried him through this ordeal.\nThis has been an absolute pleasure. I hope that the next person to receive these recordings is gonna have an easy time with them. Alright, HB out.\nGAME: ECLIPSE ECLIPSE: Hello, my name is Darling Demon Eclipse, or just Eclipse, she/they pronouns, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna start doing the character creation for Unplugged Survivor. So, I\u0026rsquo;m going to” choose character traits from each section below that are unique to you and cannot be used by future players.” So, perceptive, moralistic, and deceitful have been used, and hardworking, high spirited, and foolish have been used. So, let me see here. These are some really fun ones.\nI love a self-deprecating character. I think we\u0026rsquo;re gonna go with that. That\u0026rsquo;s very fun. And then from there, neutral. Um, busy is pretty fun. I think we\u0026rsquo;re gonna go with busy. And negative, let\u0026rsquo;s see. So, I can\u0026rsquo;t do deceitful or foolish. Bizarre is calling to me, for sure. Um, yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m kind of feeling first best with bizarre. So, we have self-deprecating, busy, and bizarre for my character.\nThen I answer “what\u0026rsquo;s your story?” Um… these are great questions. I– a self-deprecating, busy, and bizarre character. Well, first of all, I think this character is Jewish. Like, to be clear, I myself am Jewish, so, uh, yeah, this character tracks to me as being Jewish in some way.\nUm, what is this person? Self-deprecating, busy, and bizarre. Maybe some sort of administrator? I really like that. This is someone who works in an office building. They\u0026rsquo;re an accountant. Or they were an accountant before they got plugged in.\nUm, how long have they been unplugged? Um, I think to be busy you gotta have been out for a little bit, right? So, let\u0026rsquo;s say this character kind of heard Satah\u0026rsquo;s end of things, uh, Celebration Establishment, and also perhaps have heard the Sheriff Easy side of Doom FM.\nHave you regained some strength? I think no. I think this is a sedentary little whelp of a character. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re gonna go with.\nLoved ones, that\u0026rsquo;s a good question. Uh, I think, I think their loved ones are plugged in. I think that– that makes a lot of sense to me. Yeah, still plugged in, still alive, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think that, uh– listen, this character\u0026rsquo;s busy. We got a busy character.\n“If you inherited this notebook from another survivor, see what they\u0026rsquo;ve experienced before you, get to know them and their stories, seek wisdom from their experience, and comfort from their own hopes and dreams.”\nSo, this character, I think is gonna have a less wacky name than, uh, Satah and HB\u0026rsquo;s characters. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking something like, uh, George something. Maybe, maybe– I mean, bizarre is important too. Like, they need to be a little freaky with it. Normal first name, that being George, and then strange last name. Like, George, George Acetone, I think is pretty good. Yeah, we’re gonna go with George Acetone. George Acetone, they/them. Yeah, just they/them. And, sorry, and it/its.\nI think what\u0026rsquo;s bizarre about George is that there is a, um– George is mostly pretty normal, but also like, fundamentally believes that the machines have altered it in a significant way and that it is like, not entirely human. Um, and this might be true on some level, but it is very strange about it. It has, it has rituals. It, you know, it has to like, grease up its joints with oil. Um, and we\u0026rsquo;ll, we\u0026rsquo;ll, we\u0026rsquo;ll, you know, I\u0026rsquo;ll get into that as I do my entries, but that\u0026rsquo;s kinda where I am. And I\u0026rsquo;m gonna get started on my first entry.\nSATAH: Hello again. How exciting to run into you here. Exactly here, as you\u0026rsquo;re in the process of meeting Darling Demon Eclipse and her absolutely sopping wet baby girl, George Acetone.\nI wanna note: Eclipse also did things a little bit differently, as is part of the beauty of this show for me, to me, as somebody who works in TTRPGs and edits TTRPGs, I thrive on seeing how exactly rules text speaks to people. Eclipse goes into the first entry without a card draw, just using it as a space to reflect on what her character learned from the past couple iterations of DOOM FM. They\u0026rsquo;re also a little bit less chatty in their card pulls than HB or I were, but you are going to love their story and their other work. Check it out at Eclipse.Gay, hire her to write or draw on your TTRPG, and look in the show notes for a direct link to her sci-fi romance duet TTRPG, Biotrophication. It\u0026rsquo;s sexy and weird and sexy-weird, much like a lot of her other recent work, and I\u0026rsquo;m so deeply grateful that she is part of these episodes. And so let\u0026rsquo;s just let her introduce you to our third survivor.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): Hello. I want you to understand why I’m talking to you, why you’re hearing my voice. Of all people. Of all people.\nAfter a few hours of crawling up blackened structural facades and stealing the occasional fresh-ish mutant animal corpse from the split rebar, I found it – the rumoured scraps of old DOOM FM, marked with ‘CE’, ‘DE’, ‘CA’, papers and machines.\nFor being part-machine myself, I’m quite the dunce with technology. Still, I managed to put the parts back together. I’ve been listening to DOOM FM in its many forms over the last few months, from the authority-damned republic of the Celebration Establishment days, to the One Directionists, to whoever wound up heading out of the city those few weeks back.\nSo, anyway. Wire to wire, wipe the scorching off. I don’t have insulated gloves or anything, but I’m a machine – it doesn’t hurt that bad. The wires only need to be cool enough to work together for a second, then seal in chewing gum or whatever else.\nSo, we’re back. I’ll use this as a log of sorts – I’m not leaving this building, I don’t think. The people in Potreblyat, they don’t like me. I’m a weird, weird thing to them. Maybe I’ll find something else in this old commercial bloc… or I’ll die, and you’ll get to hear that.\nEither way, a fine show. Just fine. You wouldn’t lose DOOM FM so easily, Potreblyat. I am your host, by circumstance, George Acetone. I’ll only disappoint.\nECLIPSE: This is the card draw for entry two. That is a queen of diamonds, and I’m going to roll a d6… that is a three. So it is a, let’s see, diamonds, “hatred”\u0026ndash; fun. And then “a meet-up with rebels”. Okay, very cool.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): This is your host, George Acetone. Many of you have demanded I repeat it, so I will – I’ll only disappoint.\nI haven’t written down anything for this show. I’ve been busy. Rebels came to my door, Realuddites, they call themselves. They don’t like technology, consider it a return to being plugged-in. I’m the loudest person using the loudest tech, so I’m an obvious target.\nFunny, I’d think the guys filling the sky with announcement drones would be the first target. I guess small dogs bite feet instead of hands.\nCame in, started kicking things. Big brown boots. Maybe I deserve it, but I had to protect myself. Had to protect this.\nI mentioned there’s a lot of exposed rebar last time, didn’t I? Well, I’ve been slicing off bits and pieces of it, some through risky but quick blind-welding, others through safe but exhausting sawing with some sharp shrapnel bits.\nImprovised little baton, held it up, looked at the guys. Out. They laughed. I started banging it hard against the wall, murmuring some incantation I’d heard from a fantasy game in the unreal. Abaaghar vizentos, or something. That really spooked them, sent them running.\nHonestly, I didn’t get any satisfaction out of that. Just back to work. I’ve started setting up a little hot plate I found, so I can start boiling some of the vermin here in the rain water the gutters collect. It’s all slow, but it’s work.\nThe luddites probably have the right idea of it, if I’m honest. I mean, who’d make something like me? Frail, cold, getting old. At least I know a thing or two.\nMan, that does actually put a smile on my face. The people out there might hate me, but if I manage in here for a moment, I can at least die knowing I did something. Fuck.\nECLIPSE: I am drawing my card and rolling my dice for journal three. I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw my card first, let\u0026rsquo;s see. That is an ace of spades. Lucky me. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a d6. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. That is a one. We\u0026rsquo;re in the one zone right now. And that is “overconfidence.” And that is “Potreblyat defenses find you.” Okay, so that\u0026rsquo;s going to be\u0026hellip; That might go fairly poorly for our friend George.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): Defences found me. I guess the Luddites told them, or they found the channel I’ve been broadcasting on, or they felt the whirring of the hot plate. It does a thing, it lets off a signal that seeps into the concrete. Only I can feel it, because I’m a machine.\nI ran, so they’d go for me, and I threw all sorts of sharp things behind me. I got cocky, I should’ve hid. It was a bad idea. They were wearing jackboots, all of my little traps meant nothing to them. They stole my clothes, broke my nose against the wall.\nI told them I was a machine, and I’d go in for reprogramming if I had to… and they laughed. Machines don’t bleed! They considered taking me out on the spot, for talking back, but one of them took pity, or something like it. Captain Hedge. Face slurred by digital masking. Just a name. My saviour, who could have just as easily been my condemner.\nIf you like the show I do here, please find me. I’ve been able to clean up my wounds alright, but I can’t protect myself here, and it’s hard to even take care of myself. [Sigh] I’ll only disappoint.\nECLIPSE: Uh, let\u0026rsquo;s hope for something a little bit better. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. That is a 10 of hearts. So, let\u0026rsquo;s see. I gotta roll a d6 as well. That is a 3. So– oh, wonderful. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s great. So this is hearts three, which is “friendship,” and “discovered resources,” so this should be a nice and happy one. Yippee.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): Hi. Someone sought me out, and they brought real food, and real water, folk medicine, and disks to play on the radio. All hard metal stuff, but it’s better than the rain drip sounds I’ve been recording from the gutter. I don’t know if I deserve this sort of care, but I don’t dare look a gift horse in the mouth.\nToxy Tina, from a Toxoplasymbiosis tribute band, it’s… is the one who showed up. Says Doom FM has been big for Toxoplasymboiosis and its subsequent tributes for years now. Singer’s Someone Wonderful… Someone Wonderful, which is the person’s actual real name. Pretty ‘cool.’\nI feel… cool. Liked. Maybe I don’t need to spend all of my time in this dark hole. I built a nice window to the outside, with blinds and everything. Green things still grow here, despite the small-scale nuclear generator which presumably powers my functions. Hopefully it doesn’t mutate Toxy Tina.\nWell, hopefully it doesn’t mutate Toxy Tina more than she’s already mutated. She has a flap of fungal flesh on her right shoulder. Apparently that’s where she got the mushrooms for the… you know, that subject may be a bit too gross for the radio.\nAnyways. I don’t know. Things might be okay. I’ll only disappoint… but for once I hope not to.\nECLIPSE: Let\u0026rsquo;s see. Card draw. That is a six of diamonds. And we\u0026rsquo;re gonna roll the die. That is a five. So it is “escape.” Ooh. And “a mutated creature appears.” Well that– I think that sets itself up pretty nice.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): I’m so, so hungry. My joints aren’t properly oiled. My legs and arms hurt. If you hear this, please send help to my previously detailed emergency location, shared with one Toxy Tina. I have moved what technology I can to this secondary location, but I am severely limited in my ability to treat my wounds.\nThose things I’ve been eating… they had a mama. Big, hairy thing with claws and big, bioluminescent things that looked like eyes, but turned out to be… stingers. I got one in my arm. I think I’ve suffered the brunt of whatever payload it has in it, but… this really gnarly sleep-toxin. Can’t get the thing out of my arm.\nCreature’s gone, I think. I closed the door behind me, in my emergency location. I can… I can probably say, it’s an old school’s isolation room. Can you believe they used to put kids in these things? Potreblyat could drop a ten-ton bomb on this building and I’d survive.\nThis facility is interesting. Left over math sheets have drawn my attention, just doing the rote addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. It’s so quick, and I’ve built up a stack of them at this point. Maybe I really am a machine, a calculator.\nIn the world past Potreblyat, are there jobs for calculators? Freedom, don’t disappoint. I’m gonna get out of here someday, I think. I hope. Please?\nECLIPSE: The card is the King of Clubs. I forgot to say this on the last two that had a face or an ace or a jack. This is an ominous one. So we’re two for ominous, one for hopeful. That kind of determines your ending. So things are not looking great for our host, George Acetone here. Um, let\u0026rsquo;s roll– I gotta roll a D6 now. King, King of Clubs, and a D6 for the specifics on that, or I guess the vibe. That is a 3. So that is “insecurity”, “found by hunters or radicals.” Ooh, okay. I\u0026rsquo;m split between introducing a new thing or bringing in the Realuddites again. I think I might do the latter just to keep this kind of compact. I know I used them as rebels previously, but I think– I think this works out.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): Realuddites found me again. No help arrived, just people who want to hurt me. Took me out and started beating the ever-loving shit out of my poor aching body. I’m just a heap now. I fear I might never get back to my full rig.\nThey tried to break all my emergency radio tech, but I managed to scrabble it back together. I’m running on awful, banged-up batteries, and I fear if I let this broadcast run too long I’ll run all the way out.\nI’m sorry there’s been no music for a while. I was listening to the station on some awful kids’ radio, doing a check, in one of the burnt out classrooms, and I realized that the station was just playing static while I wasn’t talking. Doom FM – it always goes away. It’s bound to go away.\nI’m sorry I disappointed you. If you still have it in you, come find me. Come help me.\nECLIPSE: Woof. Okay, this is going to be the drawing and dice roll for journal entry seven. Things could get really dark, or maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll see a resurgence! Let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nOkay, so pretty normal entry. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be an eight of diamonds, and the dice roll is a five. So, let\u0026rsquo;s see, that is going to be “escape”. Aha, so perhaps we\u0026rsquo;ll return to our normal locale. And “secrets of Potreblyat revealed.” Ooh, okay. Maybe there are some tunnels, that\u0026rsquo;s fun. Like maybe, maybe they get back to their previous location through– through some tunnels that run under the school into the blown out commercial building that they were hanging out in.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): Potreblyat is made to be surveilled and navigated with ease – that’s what I’ve come to understand. I was never in any real danger. I could always return home.\nYou see, there are tunnels that run under every inch of Potreblyat, for those with the eyes to find their entrances. They were clearly built a long time ago, full of collapsed pipes and creaking supports, but they do work, and they run all throughout the city.\nI’m back home now, with all my tech. Turns out, my transmitter wasn’t far enough to reach Tina and the other locals. They weren’t ignoring me, I was just too far away. Next time, I’ll run toward help. I tend to run away, it’s a problem I have.\nPeople of Potreblyat, you’ve taken care of me since my return. You don’t disappoint. Up next, more of our local slap-metal band Unplugged \u0026amp; Unleashed with Freaky Slime-Tongue Girl.\nECLIPSE: Let\u0026rsquo;s see. Five of hearts with a four on the roll. Cool. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. So that is going to be conviction. Interesting. “Discovered knowledge about the world” and” surprise”. Cool. So that fits really well.\nWhat is our radio host going to learn? I like the idea of maybe keeping this one light because I feel like it fits the previous one. Maybe this is like our radio host learns a bit about the local bands. I could write up some more local band stuff because that\u0026rsquo;s pretty fun and I enjoyed that in the previous two journals by Satah and HB. Hell yeah.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): Okay, so – I’m going to make a bit of a request. I’ve got a few local bands that I’m still looking for burned music from. I know, I’m too frail to get it myself, yadda yadda, but I’d still really appreciate it! I’m building up a bit of a collection.\nHell, if you know any of these folks, tell them to make the climb up to the studio and we’ll get them in for a recording. I can’t promise my digs are stellar, but they’re, y’know, stable. The structure sustains itself. Anyways! The bands:\nFunreality Party. Their name is a parody of an existing political faction, which has required them to hide out a few times. Electric disco type stuff. The lead lady’s got crazy hair.\nPotre \u0026amp; Wyatt. Similarly, their name has gotten them in hot water for being similar to Potreblyat. Folk music, but one of them has a frog ribbit mutation so it’s got a real… What’s the character called, Hermit the Fraud… vibe?\nDronedunk. Robot themed ladies who do robot-ish music. I wanna know what they know about robots.\nThat’s all I got! Potreblyat, get me those folks’ records, or get me the folks themselves – don’t disappoint me! Hehe.\nECLIPSE: Okay, so it has actually been a week in real life, so I actually lost the site that I was using for the deck of cards, but I have the results.\nSo the first one is queen of clubs. I just rolled a 2 on the die. So that is “doubt,” and queen is “meet up with rebels.” Perhaps we\u0026rsquo;ll meet up with some actually nice rebels this time, but maybe there will be some doubts about whether– whether our protagonist wants to actually go and potentially leave with them, because things are looking pretty… we\u0026rsquo;re at two hopeful– two freedom, two failure. Two hopeful, two ominous. So we\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): Folks – for once, a normal gaggle of undergrounders sought me out.\nIt turns out the tunnels I used to escape the old school, they’re inhabited. They call themselves the Blackmolds, unplugged miners and engineers, and in the next few weeks they’ll be drilling through a passage that leads out of the city.\nThey want me to help them with the calculations, say that it’s a lot of basic math they just need to brute-force through. In return, they’ll get me out of here.\nI dunno. I’m going to miss all of you if I leave. Gonna miss the music. Still, I think it might be worth it. Finally figure out what life is for me, instead of running and scrounging. Figure out what’s in my head, in my wrists, in my heart. Metal, or bone?\nIf I do leave, you’ll hear from me one last time. I promise. I won’t disappoint.\nECLIPSE: The next card is… actually hopeful. It\u0026rsquo;s jack of spades. So we\u0026rsquo;ve escaped.\nThe questions are, how have you changed since the start of your journey? Who have you become? What happened to the people and creatures you met on this journey? Have you left anything behind in the city for them to find? Are any of them looking for you now?\nSo yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna kind of get into those in the journal entry.\nECLIPSE (AS GEORGE ACETONE): I’ve made my choice. Goodnight, Potreblyat.\nI came to you a wet, terrified thing, but you’ve hardened me – not in the sense that I am now cold to the world. I know that there are people now, and perhaps I’m one of them, or part-one of them. Just because I am a mechanism, doesn’t mean I need to be a lone mechanism.\nIt’s a good thing I’m leaving now, if I’m honest. The Realuddites have been getting loud recently, angry, shouting down some of the more agreeable factions. The New Reality, The Simulationists, all tangled up in trying to argue by the Realuddites’ terms.\nI think the Blackmolds have the right of it – it’s time to leave. If you can get out, get out. I can’t say much about how and where I’m getting out, but I don’t think they’re going to find us.\nLocal bands, keep making music. I’m sorry I couldn’t be the most knowledgeable host in the world, and I’m sorry I couldn’t play any pre-plug hits. I used what I had, and I leave all of it to you. Make something beautiful.

I\u0026rsquo;m your host Satah, and I\u0026rsquo;m showcasing multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together.\nThis is episode one of our game of Village Witch, a solo journaling game about a witch finding a home by Eliot Crow. In Village Witch, you play a witch looking for a village. You\u0026rsquo;ve just finished up your magical training, and now you have to strike out into the world to find the community you\u0026rsquo;re going to live and work in. It won best solo game at the 2023 Crit Awards, which I somehow completely missed until I sat down to write this introduction.\nThe other mages joining me on this journey of self-discovery are Agatha C and Rhiannon Daly. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a little bit more about them at the break.\nOne of the reasons that I selected this game to feature on the show is that it is very much not in my genre. I\u0026rsquo;m not typically somebody who reaches for a fantasy or especially sort of a cozy fantasy energy, but I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s good to expand my comfort zone and give my guests a more diverse selection of like vibes to choose from when it comes to their contributions.\nI also thought that the temporal framework of the game, the way that it divides sections up into seasons, would be really thematic and lovely and really ground things in space and time in a way that would be very generative, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s totally true.\nAnd also, I wanted to play something that uses tarot cards. You can play it with a regular set of just playing cards– one of my guests does– but I specifically wanted the opportunity to lean into that magicky feeling. And, uh… if you\u0026rsquo;re wondering why it is that I\u0026rsquo;m somebody who generally avoids fantasy as a genre, but I do own tarot cards? … Yeah, man! Yeah. I know.\nSpeaking of self-contradictory, fully complex human beings and people, let\u0026rsquo;s hop into character and world creation and learn a little bit about the witches that we\u0026rsquo;re going to spend the next few weeks with.\nGAME: CHARACTER \u0026amp; WORLD CREATION SATAH: All right.\nRHI: All right.\nAGATHA: Okay!\nRHI: Gonna go ahead and get started with my game of Village Witch.\nAGATHA: This is the Village Witch.\nSATAH: Village Witch time.\nRHI: Getting started with the setup first.\nAGATHA: Okay, “You\u0026rsquo;ve completed your training and are ready to become a village witch. You\u0026rsquo;ve been sent by the order to find a village to work in and have a year to find the place you want to make your life. You have a list of villages that have requested a witch and may now set out to find your new home. Many villages can keep a spot set aside for a witch or healer, which will become your home as long as you stay.\nSATAH: So the setup here is a little bit more freeform than I generally like? I really like it when my games have more guidance for character creation, just because like having such a wide open space is just not very generative for me.\nAGATHA: It\u0026rsquo;s just a bunch of questions. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing a lot of OSR games and they all have all these rollable tables. So I was like– what if it gives me tables?\nSATAH: But with the help of some online generators, I think that we’ll be good to go, so.\nAGATHA: “What sort of setting is your world?” is very interesting because like, I mean, the setup or the introduction of this game implies quite a few things. Well, even some of these questions– like, “What sort of broom do you have?? This implies a very Western setting, which is fine either way. But it is interesting that it does make certain choices about the setting. I think that\u0026rsquo;s helpful for playing a solo game, especially because you just need fictional constraint to kind of work off of, I feel.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s definitely like an official system. And like if many villages set this aside, this is kind of like– this is like a governmental post almost is what it feels like to me.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be modern. I think I do want to do fantasy, fantasy historical, but I\u0026rsquo;m curious about how well I can play this game using a non-Western idea for my setting. So I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of like vaguely fantasy China, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to slot in this witch kind of position in a way that in a way that would make sense. I suppose I could do it like, like a witch is also a teacher, and lean more into the herbalist aspect of it. But they also– I feel like this, there are implications that a witch is also shamanic in some ways. So this is that kind of role, except in this alternate history, fantasy China, shamanic witches still hold pretty venerable positions? And they can read and write. So they have some kind of like a teaching sort of aspect to them as well, which is why it feels more like an official thing. And then you went to a school that then sends you out from like a centralized location, right? That all feels very– feels very official and like there\u0026rsquo;s money and social backing behind it. So I think that\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;m going to imagine it is that this is a, yeah. Fantasy China and there are schools– I think there are multiple schools for witches and you study for, like, different kinds of positions. And then this particular position is the kind of local posting that you would then get sent out to. Or like this is kind of like a boots on the ground level of witches. There are also higher levels, but that\u0026rsquo;s not who we are, so.\nSATAH: The setting of my world, hmm, probably going to go relatively modern ish. Hmm. Well, I think, you know, without drawing a lot of like dark lines, like, you know, just really sketching it out, I think that the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m pulled towards is a sort of like Adventure Time post apocalyptica? Um, not doing sort of a like sci fi cyberpunk thing, as would usually be the direction I\u0026rsquo;m going, keeping it genuinely fantasy and like fantastical and low tech, but in a future.\nAnd the reason I like that is that I just want– I want to be able to explore… I like– I\u0026rsquo;m just interested in low technology after an Event, capital E Event, rather than setting it in the past in some way.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of vague, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to say this is in a like low technology, gentle post apocalyptica. Not quite Tears of the Kingdom, a little Breath of the Wild, but like softer angles, not as much tech even as that? So yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say gentle, low tech post apocalyptica.\nRHI: Let’s see. “What sort of setting is your world?” The thing I jumped to is that modern is not super appealing to me. Historical would kind of bug me too. But maybe that sort of like, uh, very lived in fantasy world where it\u0026rsquo;s like the fantasy elements of it are very matter of fact, right? There\u0026rsquo;s like magic in the world and maybe it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous, but like, you know, so is the weather in real life, right? And it kind of– kind of takes on that same tone of like part of the reason why a village would have a witch is because there are things out of everyone\u0026rsquo;s control that are just kind of part of life and part of the rhythm of the year. Yeah, I think that\u0026rsquo;s a good foundation for that.\nAGATHA: Okay. So I think I figured out the “what sort of abilities do I have”. So it\u0026rsquo;s definitely herb– herbalist and divining. And my other ability is reading and writing, which is always a valuable skill or set of skills. I think I will just go with she/her, same as myself, and just not think about that further.\nUm. “What is my name?” That– I don\u0026rsquo;t have a name generator open.\nSATAH: The way that I always come up with random names pretty much is to go to random noun generator and then start saying them together.\nNegotiation is a great one. Charity is also just a name. Resolution… let\u0026rsquo;s do another list. Foundation Passenger. I love that. Introduction Passenger actually is going to be the full name. Introduction Passenger. But everyone just calls me Duck. Duck, short for Introduction, full name Introduction Passenger. Regular name, a name that a person has.\nRHI: “What is your name?” I think my character\u0026rsquo;s name is going to be Viv, short for Vivian. I think she/her pronouns for for Viv here.\nAGATHA: Chinese witch names. This isn’t going to give me anything. Popular Chinese names for boys and girls. Okay. Generation names. All of these characters are– they\u0026rsquo;re kind of like– like they\u0026rsquo;re very– this particular list are so old school and like a little bit cringe. Anyway, that\u0026rsquo;s not relevant to this game, but it\u0026rsquo;s just funny seeing this this list.\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;ll go with Chinese herbs and choose one of those. There are a lot is the thing. So herbs and use. List of medicines. Okay. Chrysanthemum. That\u0026rsquo;s a classic. Ginkgo maybe? Yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s call her Ginkgo. A classic for memory. It\u0026rsquo;s especially always recommended to older people to help prevent memory loss. So I think that would be a very interesting thematic name.\nI\u0026rsquo;m usually pretty, um– I don\u0026rsquo;t think a lot about the names because there are just so many characters to create that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as much to me anymore as it used to.\nSATAH: So, Duck. Duck is my name. What is my gender? Ugh, god. None. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I\u0026rsquo;m a witch… that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to imply anything about gender. But let\u0026rsquo;s let\u0026rsquo;s give this person some pronouns at the very least… let\u0026rsquo;s just say they’re a they/she.\nRHI: And let\u0026rsquo;s see, “What sort of abilities do you have?” I like the idea that most of the abilities that like are notable, I guess for what she does for a community she\u0026rsquo;s embedded in aren\u0026rsquo;t really magical. Like she– she knows about that stuff. She has like a general education in it and like maybe has one particular magical specialty? But then also just has a mundane thing she does really well that is most of what, um she\u0026rsquo;s doing with her time, when you know, there isn\u0026rsquo;t such a huge situation that magic is called for, right?\nSo I think as far as a magical ability for her, let\u0026rsquo;s say maybe healing, right? Sort of like on a magical first aid level and also maybe more dramatic things as situations call for. But outside of that, I think that she does– probably a lot of gardening. And maybe those intersect on some level, right? Maybe you know, she\u0026rsquo;s growing herbs to help with the healing stuff. But it\u0026rsquo;s also just good to have something to contribute when you\u0026rsquo;re not in a situation so dire that somebody needs to be magically healed.\nSATAH: What sort of abilities do I have? So this game is in part– like it says like, you know, “villages often have places for witches or healers,” which makes me think that healing is like a standard assumption here. I\u0026rsquo;m also thinking of– I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading the Wizard of Earthsea series for the first time. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of like what sort of labour powers tend to– tend to come up as something that sort of the local mage has? There\u0026rsquo;s weather control, um… specifically wind is something that\u0026rsquo;s really common in Wizard of Earthsea just because it is so much about… harbour logistics and sailing…\nSo weather is one– maybe something with farming? Like a green thumb kind of thing is very possible. Repair is frequent. Ooh, I think that I\u0026rsquo;m going to leave it kind of open. Like I have a lot of powers, but I think I\u0026rsquo;m drawn to, um – it\u0026rsquo;s repair, but it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s more than that. It\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s– I have like, specifically I have a tendency– like I make clothes and something about like, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m really good at imbuing magic into the stitches to give the clothes certain effects? And I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s like– I can\u0026rsquo;t like, you know, give you magic powers or probably even like let you fly or something. But I can make it like– I can give you a cardigan that… makes you less likely to get lost for like a long journey kind of thing. Or like gloves that– gloves that protect you in some way or like steady your hands for small work. Like just, I– just general little like clothing charms I think is going to be one of my specific like specialties. But I do think kind of an all around like helping people out with with magic stuff? And then maybe sort of in the narrative, I will find like something that\u0026rsquo;s a little more interesting to focus in on.\nRHI: “Do you prefer being a solitary witch or having a nearby coven?” I think solitary for Viv. I think of her as being someone who is attracted to the idea of being a village witch because she wants the things she likes doing to be able to help people, but not necessarily because of, um… the place in the community that it gives her. I guess what I\u0026rsquo;m saying is I think of her as pretty shy. And somebody who would keep her distance a little bit from other witches, um; be kind of standoffish in that way.\nAGATHA: “Does she prefer being a solitary witch or having a nearby coven?” I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I want to– I want to roll dice for this. I feel like at the beginning of the story, when it\u0026rsquo;s character beats, that\u0026rsquo;s where I don\u0026rsquo;t have as good of an idea. Whereas if it\u0026rsquo;s, um– if it\u0026rsquo;s like setting or world building, I am usually a bit better at the beginning of a game for it.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s odds, then it\u0026rsquo;s– she prefers being solitary. And then if it\u0026rsquo;s evens, she prefers having a nearby coven. Okay, I rolled a six. So that\u0026rsquo;s even, which means that she prefers the company of other witches. Okay, cool. Yeah, she might like to be alone at times, but she wishes that there were more- uh– there were other witches around or that there was more support, like official support for kind of like a local witch.\nSATAH: “Do you prefer being a solitary witch or having a nearby coven?” Interesting. So I\u0026rsquo;m being sent off to like, be The Village Witch. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to understand what that means for a coven like what the relationship is there. And I think that part of the thing is, yes, I\u0026rsquo;m being sent out by an order. So I have been working with some sort of group, presumably getting training. And I think that– I think that Duck doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a preference yet. Like, I think that they were very much on their own for a long time, and then sort of like, ended up in training and sort of like, experienced what it was like to be around other people with power for the first– like similar powers for the first time. And so, um… the sense I\u0026rsquo;m getting– because because– a desire to be a solitary witch could could come from a lot of places, one of which is like, “I want to be the only one with power nearby.” Like, that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s certainly not them, I don\u0026rsquo;t think. Like they really do want to just help people. I think if they\u0026rsquo;re nervous about a coven or like other people, other witches, other mages being around them, I think that it\u0026rsquo;s almost like an insecurity? Um, that like, maybe their powers tend to be very subtle. Like they\u0026rsquo;re doing these sort of enhancing charms and like protective charms. And so they\u0026rsquo;re like, maybe, you know, “If other people are around, maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t like, have a lot to offer.” But I think that they aren\u0026rsquo;t opposed to it. It\u0026rsquo;s just like an autom– like, their first instinct would be to be like nervous about that.\nSo not totally an answer. But I\u0026rsquo;m going to say they\u0026rsquo;re figuring it out.\nAnd I think one important thing for me to note here is that the the thought I\u0026rsquo;m immediately having is like, they weren\u0026rsquo;t othered for having magical powers in like, you know, their home community, whatever it was, like their– their their first home. They were probably they were probably the only one that… did have powers like this. They didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up with everybody just doing magic. But it was like– it didn\u0026rsquo;t make them weird. And so it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, it\u0026rsquo;s not like they went off to witch school and were like, “Oh my god, I\u0026rsquo;m being accepted for the first time.” You know, like, they\u0026rsquo;re like, “I\u0026rsquo;m gonna get along fine, kind of no matter what, I think that people are pretty much cool to me.” Yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nRHI: “What sort of broom do you have?” I think of her as having sort of like a shabby but well-maintained hand me down, right? Like she\u0026rsquo;s taking good care of it. She\u0026rsquo;s repaired it, maybe, a few times, but it\u0026rsquo;s not it\u0026rsquo;s not anything special. It\u0026rsquo;s, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s another tool to her.\nSATAH: “What sort of broom do you have?” The visual I\u0026rsquo;m getting is definitely just your very standard old straw broom. But I think as sort of a hat tip– witch hat tip, pointy brimmed hat tip– to their sort of enhancing charms thing, it\u0026rsquo;s probably been like repaired a lot. They might even call the broom Theseus or something like that, you know? Like, parts of it have been replaced just so often that it is like this constantly evolving thing. But mostly it just– it looks like your kind of classic straw broom with a lot of like obvious glue and nail and repair marks and stuff tied around it and, uh, new finish and and whatever. Like they\u0026rsquo;re– they\u0026rsquo;re constantly repairing it.\nAGATHA: That\u0026rsquo;s the thing that I find very interesting about game design is that a lot of times you put in a specific prompt, or you put in, like, an assumption about the world in your text. And this helps people build their own world, because they can either choose to go along with your prompt, or they can choose to go against it, right. So like, for me, I\u0026rsquo;m reading this, “What sort of broom do you have?” And I\u0026rsquo;m like, well, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a broom. But I never even thought about a broom until I read it here. And now I\u0026rsquo;m thinking, okay, so then what\u0026rsquo;s the alternative, then, that my witch would have? How do I travel?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s through magical means. I would be travelling just through mundane means, the same as most other people. So like, donkey carts or horse carts, that kind of thing.\nSATAH: “What is my favourite season?” The first thing that came to mind was fall, because like… I think that– I\u0026rsquo;m going to decide whether it\u0026rsquo;s fall or winter. But but the first thought I had was that Duck really likes colder months, because, like, more clothes start to come out, you know? Like, there is just more for them to work with. And you know, people always need their coats sewed up– uh, sewn up and everything. And they need like gloves fixed and all that kind of thing.\nI think specifically fall, because I think in winter, those repairs do happen, but they\u0026rsquo;re a little bit more like emergency. And then fall sort of has like some of the maintenance repairs, like people pull a sweater out of their closet, and they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Oh, shit, I forgot that when I put this here, I was like, ‘I have to remember this summer to patch up those elbows that I– that got ripped.’” And then the first cold day they pull out the sweater and they\u0026rsquo;re like, “I didn\u0026rsquo;t patch the elbows! Duck??” You know.\nI also think that part of what I\u0026rsquo;m establishing here, or like is being established is that Duck likes the slow prep work, like finds fall exciting, because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like. Alright, this is our chance to get ready for winter. Winter can be really hard. But if we do fall right, then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be. Yeah.\nAGATHA: Wow, this Wikipedia page is really telling me everything except the one thing I need. Ginkgo bloom season? Early… oh. Early spring, late spring and mid spring. Okay. So– so spring. Okay.\nUm, let\u0026rsquo;s say that that is her favourite season. She loves spring the most, because it is the time when the earth wakes up.\nSo with that, I think she\u0026rsquo;s also from a place where there are seasons. Where it does get colder in the winter, and then it gets hotter in the summer? Actually, what if she is from a place that is warmer in general, so there is the rainy season, the dry season, that kind of thing. So she likes the idea of spring, because it feels very– it feels symbolic. But she hasn\u0026rsquo;t really experienced it in that specific way.\nI think she also– she likes the dry season more probably. But that\u0026rsquo;s not relevant in this current location, because this current location has four seasons.\nRHI: For her favourite season? Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s an interesting one for like a gardener who is also a healer, right? I think that weirdly for a gardener, I actually think that winter might be her favourite. Both as like kind of a solitary person who would like the the sort of intense quiet that comes with winter, but also in that… I imagine the, the more like magical side of her expertise with the healing and everything would become a lot more important during that season? And so even though usually it\u0026rsquo;s a bad thing if that skill is needed, it\u0026rsquo;s good to have something to provide, for her. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like she feels like winter is a whole new phase of her job, right? When she\u0026rsquo;s really on call in that way.\nAGATHA: Now, “what is she leaving behind?” I think she is leaving behind heartache. I think she was supposed to be married. And it was a point of contention for her as she\u0026rsquo;s still studying to become a village witch. But then in the end, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work out. And she couldn\u0026rsquo;t get married anyway. So she kind of– that basically made her decision for her that she is going to keep pursuing this village witch path.\nSATAH: “What am I leaving behind?” I mean, it sounds like I had a home of some kind. I don\u0026rsquo;t really know why I\u0026rsquo;m not there specifically. I mean, I might like– I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what my drive is, specifically, yet. Like, you know, I came to this order, whatever it is, and got trained and now they\u0026rsquo;re sending me out. I imagine it\u0026rsquo;s an option for me to return home, but I\u0026rsquo;m kind of like, “I should explore and see if I would be more helpful elsewhere.” And so I guess I\u0026rsquo;m– yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m leaving that behind. Like, the– the comfort and the certainty of like the thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve always had?\nAnd I imagine the order… is… has… is a physical place that I\u0026rsquo;ve been at least part of the year or whatever.\nMm… I think tied to sort of the like, idea that Duck loves preparation is that leaving training is difficult for them in some ways, because they\u0026rsquo;re like… that\u0026rsquo;s kind of the thing they love, in a lot of ways, is like the process of preparing for something. And I think that there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit less satisfaction for them in the thing actually happening. Like, “I\u0026rsquo;ve been training for this. I love that. I love to get ready.” And then being sent out in the world is like, “Oh, yeah, sure. I guess I did all I could to get myself to this moment. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.” So another thing I\u0026rsquo;m leaving behind is just like, the joy of… looking– is it looking forward to something? Is it? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna say like the joy of preparation and training and the unknown. Like the the the more unknown unknown. The less known unknown.\nRHI: What is she leaving behind? I think not that much. I kind of think of her as somebody who has not made very many close connections with other people up to this point in her life.\nSATAH: “What do I desire most?” Gosh. Is it– is it– is it silly to say something like, I want to make clothes from scratch for people instead of just repairing their stuff? Is that goofy? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I think that\u0026rsquo;s too big of a question for me at the moment, I think. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I know enough about sort of what I\u0026rsquo;ve got going on.\nRHI: “What do you desire most?” is kind of a terrifying question. Both real life and for a character. Like what? Oh god. How do I answer that? I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t know if she knows. Yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I think I might pass on this one.\nAGATHA: “What does she desire most?” I think she wants to find herself. A lot of her identity was wrapped around– well, the conflict of either getting married and doing something else with her schooling or becoming a village witch, which is a very particular kind of role. I feel like they hold a very central position in a lot of villages, but all these villages are also kind of out in the middle of nowhere. It\u0026rsquo;s a very non city sort of position. So she wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what she wanted. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly sure who she was either. Like, it seemed like it was either or. And now that she\u0026rsquo;s chosen village witch, or it was chosen for her because the marriage didn\u0026rsquo;t go through for whatever reason– we might explore more of it later– now she\u0026rsquo;s trying to figure out… how is she a village witch? What does it mean to live without the person that she thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with?\nOkay, and–\nRHI: Alright, I guess that\u0026rsquo;s my setup.\nAGATHA: Those are all of the setup questions.\nSATAH: Great.\nAGATHA: Wow.\nSATAH: And that\u0026rsquo;s my setup.\nBREAK SATAH: Hello again. In just a moment, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be establishing the places that our witches are going to be living for at least the season of spring. But before we get into that, I want to let you know a little bit more about some cool shit that my guests are up to.\nRhiannon Daly is a writer and game designer who I met on Tumblr over a decade ago. You can find her on Twitter at CNIDARIAA and find some of her work at scyphozoan.itch.io, both linked, of course, in the show notes. Particularly in my opinion, you should check out her Ludum Dare Jam contribution from a couple years ago, which is called Ghost Moth. It\u0026rsquo;s a science fiction horror text game about parasitism and gig work. It is atmospheric and awful in all of the exact ways it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be, and very emblematic of the creepy, surreal horror that Rhi really excels in as a creator.\nAgatha C is a game designer, freelance writer and co-host of Asians Represent! and The Game Design Game Show. You can find her on Twitter and Bluesky as Mighty Shrimp. Check out the links in the episode description because it\u0026rsquo;s spelled a little differently on each platform. As somebody who is very invested personally in what you might call “invisible rules” in TTRPGs, especially in the narrative or story game space, I love hearing Agatha’s thoughts on what it means to push back on a game\u0026rsquo;s assumptions and expectations, and the way that she talks about how even disagreeing with what a game asks of you can be a generative experience that you might not have otherwise had. I love these sort of conversations. Every game has a point of view. Obviously, like, you can\u0026rsquo;t take yourself out of the things you create in any real meaningful, total way, and learning how to notice that, learning how to notice your point of view, learning how to notice the things that you\u0026rsquo;re saying when you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean to be saying something, will make you a much stronger designer, and so I really appreciate hearing the ways that she thinks about that.\nAs for me, you\u0026rsquo;re pretty much listening to the main thing I would otherwise want to direct you towards, so thank you! I\u0026rsquo;ve got some games and some music you can find at gaygothvibes.online, and I\u0026rsquo;m on social media generally as posatahchips. Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to hop back into the game.\nThe main game loop of Village Witch takes place over the course of a year, divided neatly into seasons. At the start of each season, if you decide to move on from your current location, you answer some questions to create a new village to head off to. Obviously, we need to create a village to start at, and that\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re going to hear now.\nNext week, we\u0026rsquo;ll start pulling cards for journal prompts as Spring… springs. Springs. Springs Springs. Mm. Spring has Sprung only really works in the past tense I\u0026rsquo;m realising. And I also have a terrible feeling that I made that same verbal misstep in my playthrough at some point, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t done the transcripts yet so I don\u0026rsquo;t have a quick way of checking. And so it\u0026rsquo;s possible you\u0026rsquo;re going to hear it twice. And I apologise. Back to the game.\nGAME: SPRING SET-UP AGATHA: “At the beginning of each season, set your house in order and prepare for the change. Then draw cards and use the prompts from the card tables to craft your story until you feel it\u0026rsquo;s time for a new season. As each season draws to an end, contemplate if it\u0026rsquo;s time to move on.” Move on as in from one location to another, because the setup of this game is that you\u0026rsquo;re still trying to figure out which village you want to be in. That\u0026rsquo;s so interesting.\nI feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve conceptualised a world that is much more bureaucratic and therefore like it\u0026rsquo;s not actually up to the witch’s desire whether they move or not? It\u0026rsquo;s more like a scheduled thing. And this would obviously be to prevent any village witch from holding– developing and holding onto too much power in each local village. So if they keep going to different locations, then obviously they can\u0026rsquo;t establish those kind of relationships.\nIt could also be that people just don\u0026rsquo;t like to stay in villages for that long. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like a way that you can rotate out of there and then maybe to a higher ranking position, which might not be in a village. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I haven’t– I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;m married to that concept, but that is something interesting for me to keep mulling over.\nBut anyway, the setup is that as each season draws to an end, I can choose whether the witch– my witch– moves to a new location or if they stay in the current location for another season.\nRHI: First, let\u0026rsquo;s figure out where Viv is going to be going for her first location. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll my extremely tiny d6 from my mahjong set, which is somehow the only d6 I have. And I got a six. Swamp. Spring in the swamp. Okay then.\nAGATHA: Okay, location. Ooh, “desert, forest, grassland, mountain, seashore, swamp.” That\u0026rsquo;s so funny because so many of these don\u0026rsquo;t have the same idea of seasons as others would. Interesting.\nOkay. I rolled another six– if only I was playing a Forged in the Dark game right now. And that is a swamp. Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s so funny. Yeah. Okay.\nSo Ginkgo is like, “Yes! I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to exploring new places and finally experiencing the four seasons that I read about in books.” And then the first place that she\u0026rsquo;s been assigned to is a– is, like, a swampland. And it is very hot. And it has like, it has like a dry and a wet season, but it is not very obvious. I guess if this was like, let\u0026rsquo;s say, like, Florida, I think they do have, like it does get cooler in the winter and that it\u0026rsquo;s not blazing hot there. But anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna stick with the wet and dry seasons.\nSo the wet season is when it\u0026rsquo;s really, really hot. So like what one can equate with summer. And then the dry season is when it gets relatively cooler, which is not really by a lot, but it\u0026rsquo;s also not raining all the time. And I\u0026rsquo;m gonna say that that\u0026rsquo;s what the swampland is like. But generally, it is muggy. It is humid.\nSATAH: So I think that– like I\u0026rsquo;m arriving to a new location, so I should roll the location dice… die… I got a one, which is a desert. That\u0026rsquo;s what– I\u0026rsquo;m playing through my Strange Places playthrough right now where I\u0026rsquo;m also in a desert and there\u0026rsquo;s no particular reason to believe that they\u0026rsquo;re the same desert, but… what if they are? What if this show is going to have a long running canon where all of the games are in the same universe secretly? That… sounds terrible. But, uh, exciting, theoretically, to try and massage that. I love to make– I love to make stuff that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, make sense. Huge fan of that.\nAGATHA: “What is your new house like? House on stilts, cottage, stone house built into a cave, something else entirely.” Let\u0026rsquo;s– let\u0026rsquo;s do stilts. I think that makes the most sense in the swampland… swampland village. Maybe the village should have a name, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nSo all houses are on stilts generally and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of travelling by boat. And “is the house in the village on the outskirts or a long walk away?” Um, I think it\u0026rsquo;s in the village? And… it\u0026rsquo;s not central because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of, like, giving the village which privacy, but it also– so it\u0026rsquo;s not central, but it has an easy access to like pretty much all parts of the village. So there are very clear boat paths. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s also like– I mean, I think there are patches of areas where you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be on the boat, you know; there\u0026rsquo;s like land that\u0026rsquo;s not completely submerged or, you know, too swampy to walk through. But this is primarily a very, very wet and marshy area.\nRHI: So I think this is, this is her sort of first– first assignment, right, after she gets done with her training? And let\u0026rsquo;s see, “what kind of house?” I\u0026rsquo;m going to say this is like a house on stilts in the swamp. That\u0026rsquo;s probably a pretty easy, uh, easy one the picture for this environment.\nIn this case, I\u0026rsquo;m really curious whether it\u0026rsquo;s a village that is in the swamp, right? Or if she\u0026rsquo;s kind of on the outskirts of it, where the swamp starts and the village ends. I think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting if the village is in the swamp here, because that makes it a little more like– I like the idea of it being, you know, the swamp being more normal to everyone else there than it is to her, as an environment. I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s see. Yeah, I think her, her house is in the village. Maybe not like right at the centre, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely in there.\nSATAH: Again, these are very open ended in a way that like runs a little bit counter to how– what I generally want from games. And so I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll some dice on the questions to– to see what the vibe is.\nSo it says, “What\u0026rsquo;s your new house like?” And then it says, “House on stilts, cottage, stone house built into a cave, something else entirely?” What I see there is a list of technically five things, but one of them is just “other.” So I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a D4 to see if it is any of the options provided to me.\nGot a one. House on stilts. Love that. Why a house on stilts in the desert? That seems– because I feel like normally you really want to like sort of go to ground in the desert, which immediately is very intriguing to me. The first vision I have is that it is like– it\u0026rsquo;s on stilts because, uh– over like a transit way of some kind? There\u0026rsquo;s either like migratory creatures or, you know, just people on camels or whatever that go through here? And stilts on sand– in sand– is so unstable… that I love– I mean, they have to be like buried super, super deep, right? They have to be buried very deep all the way down into the clay or whatever.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just going to real quick Google desert house on stilts because maybe I\u0026rsquo;m wrong. Maybe this is a thing. This has provided me no information. Okay. Whatever.\nSo I’m in the desert, I\u0026rsquo;m in a house on stilts for some reason that I will continue to explore.\nAGATHA: “What is something unique about your house?” I think what is unique about this house is that it is as big as the house of the village elder. And there\u0026rsquo;s something about that where they both have– it feels like they both have the same amount of power– like social power. One is because of their life in the village and then the other is because it\u0026rsquo;s like an official assignment kind of thing. And I feel like there is like generally tension between these kinds of things in terms of administrative power and like also just the official presence. And so in this case, that is manifesting in the sizes of the houses.\nSATAH: “What is something unique about your house?” It is on stilts.\nI think that what this actually is– the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of is like, so a house on stilts, like… I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of, of, you know, sun, sun in the desert, just like– that this is this huge open thing. And I think that one of the things about this house is that it was designed as sort of like a living art piece? And has prisms that are built to refract the sun? Like it is very much deliberately designed to play with the sun– to like, create patterns and that kind of thing? And possibly also tell time. I like the idea that it tracks time, but very beautifully. Uh, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s like a really over the top clock tower essentially that I\u0026rsquo;m– that I\u0026rsquo;m living in.\nThe note I\u0026rsquo;ve taken is, “Built very purposefully as a piece of art to refract light like a giant psychedelic sundial.” And it\u0026rsquo;s on stilts.\nAGATHA: Okay. “Is it haunted?” Um, no, I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. “Are there animal friends that come to visit?? There could be frogs. Is that– I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s the vibe that this question was going for, but sure. There can be a lot of frogs around. [Hums] Frequented by frogs.\nSATAH: “Is it haunted or is there an animal friend that comes to visit?” It is not haunted, in part because it\u0026rsquo;s new.\nI am just going to have to look up desert animals real quick cause there isn\u0026rsquo;t a bird! If there\u0026rsquo;s a bird! ‘Cause I just don\u0026rsquo;t– I like the idea that somebody that the person who designed this very tall building built it in a way that keeps birds away. ‘Cause that\u0026rsquo;s something I worry about when it comes to tall buildings.\nSo desert animals. Yeah. I mean, there\u0026rsquo;s probably like a little meerkat who comes to hang out sometimes, but I think that like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be a giant focus of my narrative, I am guessing? I could be proven wrong, but there is, there\u0026rsquo;s, there\u0026rsquo;s a meerkat who hangs out. Um, and maybe like– I\u0026rsquo;m not the best at talking to animals. Like it\u0026rsquo;s something that I can like, do, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t, you know, a specialty of mine. So maybe the meerkat’s like, “Ugh. You\u0026rsquo;re not– you\u0026rsquo;re not as cool as the other witch.”\nAGATHA: “Do you have a garden?” Yeah. I think a village witch should have one. Um, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of, uh, you kind of need it, um, as the herbalist. So there, there is like an area for planting herbs and obviously the ones that are here are kind of like– the ones that are surviving are the ones that are local to this area, but there are also quite a few pots of herbs that are commonly used, but don\u0026rsquo;t do well in this climate, and they\u0026rsquo;re just all like wilting and sad. And this is clearly planted by a previous witch.\nSATAH: “Do I have a garden?” I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. I\u0026rsquo;m in a desert. I maybe– maybe there are some little window cactuses, cacti that I take care of?\nRHI: Do you have a garden? Let\u0026rsquo;s see. I, I do like the idea of her keeping a garden here, both because that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a thing she does and because, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to have like a cultivated patch of swamp where she\u0026rsquo;s like… really growing very particular things, whether it\u0026rsquo;s in pots up on the like platform that her house is on or down in the water, right? I think that like cultivating parts of the swamp is probably a thing that people here do.\nAnd so I think that, um, also ties into the like, “who do you meet first” thing? Where– I\u0026rsquo;m getting a picture that Viv sort of gets in– you know, maybe she travelled overnight to get here, right? Um, and she\u0026rsquo;s sort of bringing a few things of hers inside, but as soon as she\u0026rsquo;s done that, she\u0026rsquo;s out taking a look at the area around her house for like a way to set up a garden. So I think– maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just one of the neighbours who notices her kind of looking around the swamp, a little bit confused, and kind of strikes up a conversation and tells her like, “Oh yeah, here\u0026rsquo;s what to look for if you want to be able to like grow plants around here.” Um, and that kind of thing.\nSo yeah, I think her first person she runs into is a neighbour and it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a pretty warm reception there.\nAGATHA: “What is your initial impression of the village and who do you meet first?” I mean, first impression is that it\u0026rsquo;s disappointingly similar to where Ginkgo grew up. I think what might be interesting is that it\u0026rsquo;s not geographically close to where Ginkgo grew up? So she\u0026rsquo;s surprised by how similar it feels, maybe like temperature-wise, and then also in terms of the moisture level in the air, like it\u0026rsquo;s pretty humid. And so she was expecting something different, but when she got here, she\u0026rsquo;s like, “Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s this.” Her skin\u0026rsquo;s gonna be so good. But she was– she was hoping for something different\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s also a lot poorer than she was expecting. I think she grew up in a decent, like a small city is how one could categorise it. So there– it\u0026rsquo;s not even close to what one could see in a big city or even the capital in terms of population or even economic prosperity. But she\u0026rsquo;s definitely used to more infrastructure than she is seeing here. So she\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, “Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s so similar to where I grew up in terms of how it feels, but also is kind of like a backwater.” So that\u0026rsquo;s kind of disappointing, as well, for her.\n[Laughing] I think she\u0026rsquo;s generally disappointed.\nAnd who does Ginkgo meet first? Well, I made Ginkgo single because I\u0026rsquo;m like, what if in addition to indulging myself by really changing up the setting, I also indulge myself further by making this solo game a dating sim.\nSo I think the first person that Ginkgo meets is the village elder’s daughter. Which I’m gonna– [Frustrated sounds] I need another name for.\nChinese herb names. Come on. Come on. And why is it always just super long articles and not the actual list?\nRen shen, or red ginseng root… I don’t know what this is… huang qi… astragalus root… bai shao– oh, white peony root! Yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s call her that. Let\u0026rsquo;s call her Peony.\nAnd Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s impression of Peony is that she\u0026rsquo;s like startlingly beautiful, I think is– as Ginkgo is kind of looking around and being like, “oh boy, like, how am I going to get used to this?” Peony is the one that shows up on the boat. And is like, “You must be the new village witch. Let me take you to your place.!”\nAnd, and like, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, just Ginkgo sees this, this boat winding out of this grove, where there are a lot of these kind of like low trees, and they– they have this– they cast a lot of shade? And so– and they\u0026rsquo;re also they just obscure vision a lot. And so it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like just the tip of a boat pointing out from the shadows and then like emerging, just this– this like loud and, um, again, beautiful young woman.\nWhenever I say young woman, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m very old. [Dusty \u0026amp; ancient voice] This young woman. [Regular voice] Yeah, and she\u0026rsquo;ll, she\u0026rsquo;ll say hi.\nSATAH: “What is your initial impression of the village, and who do you meet first?” I think in order to just kind of get into play. I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t meet anybody. Like– and I haven\u0026rsquo;t even seen the village proper. I, like, arrive in the dead of night. And I knew where I was going. And I kind of go in and get set up. And we are going to start– we\u0026rsquo;re going to see– we\u0026rsquo;re going to see the beginning play out as I start, like, answering the prompts and stuff.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. to find where you can find the show, check out foliopod.carrd.co.\nYou can find Agatha C at mightyshrimp on blue sky or mightyyshrimp with two Y\u0026rsquo;s on Twitter.\nYou can find Rihannon Daly at CNIDARIAA on Twitter and find her work at scyphozoan.itch.io\nYou can find me at posatahchips on social media generally and check out my other work at gaygothvibes.online.\nNext week, Agatha and Rih and I will continue our game of Village Witch by Eliot Crow, linked in the show notes.

I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah, and I\u0026rsquo;m showcasing multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together.\nToday we\u0026rsquo;re continuing our game of Village Witch, a solo journaling game about a witch finding a home by Eliot Crow. With me again are Agatha C and Rhiannon Daly. Check out all the relevant links in the episode description.\nLast week we created the first villages that our witches are going to go live and work in. Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to answer some seasonal setup questions, get ready for spring, and then we\u0026rsquo;re going to start pulling cards for prompts.\nAs we head into our first round of them, I particularly want to point out how lovely the writing is in the changing of the seasons. There is an ever-present sort of gentle wistfulness, and the questions are very evocative and flavourful, all in a very short package.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know about where you live, but here we are in an almost unfathomably miserable part of the year, and it feels like there\u0026rsquo;s no end in sight. And it might not be in sight, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. So if you can, join me in trying to let this remind you of better, brighter, longer days to come at some point.\nGAME SATAH: Okay.\nRHIANNON: So we\u0026rsquo;re getting started on spring now.\nSATAH: It\u0026rsquo;s spring!\nAGATHA: “Spring is in the air. The winds of winter are fading, and birds and plants speak of new life on the way. You set out to your first village and are led to your new house.”\nRHIANNON: “After walking through the house and taking in your surroundings, you perform a dwelling ritual. Pick up your broom and sweep through the house, cleansing each room as you infuse the home with your blessings.”\nSATAH: “Put away your belongings, making the space your own for now. What items are most important to you?”\nAGATHA: “What items are most important to you? What is the token you always carry with you? What do you place on your altar?” Again, this– the text has a lot of setting that my– the lore that I created goes against. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to begin to use what I want to use for my story.\n“The winds of winter are fading and the birds and plants speak of new life on the way.” That is not necessarily the case here because we are, I think, still in dry season. This is kind of like the in-between time between the dry and the wet season, but there\u0026rsquo;s not that big of a difference because even during dry season it would still rain. It just rains less. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t rain every day. So maybe it\u0026rsquo;s starting to get a little more frequent now is what it feels like.\nAfter walking through the house and smelling that familiar wet mud scent and also just– I think like it smells very strongly in– in this village of just like all of the, all of the mud that\u0026rsquo;s around and then also all of the plants that are growing everywhere. And then there are some flowers that are blooming and they have– they often have very strong and like pungent scents as well. So I think all of this is kind of wafting through the house as Ginkgo walks through.\nAnd she does do a dwelling ritual. She takes salt or rice… I think she does salt because– well, actually both of those things are very, very expensive. So I think she will take a specific kind of herb. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like burning sage, but not the same obviously because very different cultures, um, but she will go and wave it for each room that she goes into, which is basically two rooms, I think. So the kitchen area would be outdoors basically kind of like in the back and then inside there\u0026rsquo;s like a living space and then there is kind of like a public-ish space. So the living space is basically where you would sleep and then where you would have your, your materials, store your materials, things like that, and then the public space is where you would eat and where you would treat anyone who\u0026rsquo;s coming in– though a lot of times she might also just do that outside of her house, which is on stilts, but there\u0026rsquo;s like, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say like an outdoor kind of like platform just in front of the house. So people could also just come and like request her presence there.\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s like– there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of indoor-outdoor living in this village. Because of the weather, like, you don\u0026rsquo;t, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to, you know, be inside to get away from the cold, that kind of thing.\nSo yeah, she waves the plant or the dried herb in the indoor spaces and then she also then waves it in the doorway as kind of like the last rite and then she hangs it– hangs the sprig of herbs in the doorway to kind of signify her occupation. It\u0026rsquo;s also kind of like an offering to the space, to the spirit of the place.\nRHIANNON: “Put away your belongings, making the space for your own now. What items are most important to you?” I think for her, the items most important to her are going to be, you know, her sort of like, I almost want to call it a doctor\u0026rsquo;s bag, but you know, like her like healing supplies, right? The things that she needs to keep on hand in case of an emergency. So like those and just regular tools for gardening, right? Those are the things that she unpacks right away. I imagine that her sort of like personal items are kind of a little bit less importance and not really unpacked. She kind of still has a few bags that are just sitting in a corner.\nAGATHA: What items are most important to Ginkgo? I think those are her books. They are troves of knowledge and so are just generally very valuable. And being able to read them is important in this time when she is far from everyone else and the whole village would be looking to her, one would assume, for her knowledge and for her understanding. It\u0026rsquo;s good to feel like she has a support somewhere else, which is through her books.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s more, but like I think that something that gets like a place of honor, right, is like, a collection of thread. And like I imagine that I have been gifted an enormous amount of just scrap fabric and thread and people are like, “Hey, this, uh, this yarn was the first ever yarn that was created from the wool of this sheep that was the first sheep that my wife and I bought together.”\nYou know, like very ritualistic– like people love to bring me fabric that has a lot of emotional weight in it? Like maybe people give me like jackets that belonged to like their deceased loved ones or like a shirt that they wore on a first date with somebody who they\u0026rsquo;ve now broken up with and sort of like give them to me and explain the circumstances. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, great, I will use that when I need to, when it\u0026rsquo;s appropriate.\nAnd also just little like– I\u0026rsquo;m picturing a lot of like beads, clay beads and stuff that I think I both have been, like, given and also just picked up along the way. And I like the idea that I\u0026rsquo;ve made a bunch of them too. Like there\u0026rsquo;s almost– this isn\u0026rsquo;t beads, this is buttons. The idea that I\u0026rsquo;m having is like, I have a bunch of buttons that almost have like, you know, prefab charms on them. So if someone comes in in a hurry and is like, oh my god, I have a date tonight and I am so scared. I\u0026rsquo;m like, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. I can like put a button on their shirt that like gives them more confidence or like calms them down kind of thing.\nAnd so yeah, I have this like collection of fabrics and yarn and thread and accessories and beads and buttons that I\u0026rsquo;ve amassed that have like magic and feeling in them. And that is sort of like one of my top priorities.\nI think probably just like pictures of home, right? Like I still have a connection to the place that I\u0026rsquo;m from. And so it\u0026rsquo;s pictures and they\u0026rsquo;re like– I think to sort of lean into the maker magic of it, it\u0026rsquo;s like collages, right? Like I have collages made by people who I care about that like carry significance to us.\nAGATHA: “What is a token that she always carries with her?” It is actually a jade pendant that you can hang on your belt. And she doesn\u0026rsquo;t hang it on her belt, but she does keep it on her person at all times. And this is not a part of the marriage, like the betrothal gifts that her, um, her betrothed was supposed to give her. It was more like a private gift. And she also gave him something as well. So she was supposed to have returned this when the marriage didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, but she, she didn\u0026rsquo;t. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring herself to do it. Now, she can\u0026rsquo;t wear it either because that\u0026rsquo;s like– all of these things have certain significance and she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want people to ask her questions or make assumptions. And that\u0026rsquo;s what she tells herself, but she always has it. And then I think sometimes out of habit, she would just touch it when she\u0026rsquo;s feeling unsure or stressed.\nRHIANNON: Let\u0026rsquo;s see, “what\u0026rsquo;s a token you always carry with you?” Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s a tricky one. I think she has a little necklace, that um, the thing like hanging on the necklace is a seed, like a preserved seed from… maybe some kind of plant that she enjoyed, like kind of attending to where she grew up. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot from home, but she– she keeps that.\nSATAH: “What is a token you always carry with you?” So like I\u0026rsquo;m, I\u0026rsquo;m, I\u0026rsquo;m going first in sort of a sewing kit direction, right? Like a little bag of emergency stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think if there\u0026rsquo;s something like more personal that I\u0026rsquo;m interested in defining here.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something that I\u0026rsquo;m, I\u0026rsquo;m angling towards that I can\u0026rsquo;t quite get, so I\u0026rsquo;ll talk through it out loud. Like I\u0026rsquo;m imagining again, a button or, or a clasp or something that like– my, my first thought is like the first button I had to replace, but then I\u0026rsquo;m like, why do I have it? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s broken? Yeah, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll– I\u0026rsquo;ll figure out how to define it better, but I have– I mean, I have my like emergency sewing kit that I do just always have, you know, in my little pouches and whatever. And I have a spare button that I am like, for some reason that I will discover, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, like, “One day I will find the thing that needs this button. I haven\u0026rsquo;t found it yet, but I know that somewhere out there, there is something, there is a garment that needs specifically this button and I will know it when it comes to me and it will be necessary at the time.”\nAGATHA: “What does she place on her altar?” I don\u0026rsquo;t know what this altar is and what that means. So I\u0026rsquo;m just going to say that that herb hanging on the doorway is the offering and that is what is placed.\nSATAH: “What do you place on your altar?” Huh. I think that, um– part of the thing here is that like, I was never really an altar type of person, like growing up, you know, cause I wasn\u0026rsquo;t around other magic users and that kind of thing. And so my altar is like mostly a bunch of stuff that I got given by the order. It\u0026rsquo;s like, you know, baby\u0026rsquo;s first little cauldron and whatever. Like I have, I have sort of the like beginner kit of witch stuff and I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of not, I don\u0026rsquo;t like pay a lot of attention to it. You know? Like, I recognize its importance for like specific things, but as of yet, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had a reason to like upgrade anything.\nRHIANNON: As far as, “what do you place on your altar?” I like the idea that she knows that people will kind of expect her to have an altar, but she doesn\u0026rsquo;t really, like, know what she would put on it or why. And so it\u0026rsquo;s just like a few items that look like magic, right? Like it\u0026rsquo;s a few vials of mysterious liquid and maybe some, you know, some tools that look like they belong to a witch, right? But it\u0026rsquo;s not– I don\u0026rsquo;t think of it as an important thing to her.\nSATAH: And with that, we\u0026rsquo;re going to start pulling cards.\nRHIANNON: I\u0026rsquo;m going to quickly shuffle my old Smithwaite tarot deck.\nSATAH: [Over intermittent sound of paper kind of ripping] Oh, oh, these tarot cards. These cards have been through so much. Oh my god. They actually might be a little bit dead. I am so sorry, buddies. You\u0026rsquo;ve lived such a life. Let\u0026rsquo;s try and get some of these unstuck from each other. Ooh, are you mad at me?\nOh my god. Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m going to need a new deck. These are– sorry for the, like, paper gore that you\u0026rsquo;re hearing. I love you cards. Sorry. The thing is, I like, carried these around with me every day for several years and they look like it. I love objects and they generally look well used after I\u0026rsquo;ve had them.\nOkay. I\u0026rsquo;m going to shuffle these. They don\u0026rsquo;t feel mad at me. Forgive the woo. I mean, whatever. We\u0026rsquo;re playing a game with tarot cards. If you own tarot cards, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to judge people for being woo, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s not fair; I absolutely judge people for being woo. But like there\u0026rsquo;s a certain amount of woo, you know, that is inherent to it. Sort of an endearing level– just baseline of woo.\nAGATHA: I don\u0026rsquo;t own any tarot cards, so I\u0026rsquo;ll have to go with the regular playing cards. But there are some prompts that only exist in the major arcana. So what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is I\u0026rsquo;m going to use a dice roller, I guess, for that instead. I might do it just like once per season, maybe. I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure how the numbers work in terms of probability. And if that maps up to how often a major arcana would be pulled normally in just a tarot deck. But yeah, I definitely want to engage with them because they look interesting. They\u0026rsquo;re a bit more intense, I guess, is what it seems like? So I definitely want that.\nRight. So I have my deck of cards and then the major arcana are numbered from 0 to 21. As opposed to from 1 to 22. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this has something to do with tarot– again, I don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about it. But it\u0026rsquo;s not as helpful if I want to roll dice to determine what major arcana prompt I\u0026rsquo;m going to use. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to renumber it in my head as 1 to 22 instead of 0 to 21.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to Google roll D22. rolladie.net has custom sides, like side numbers. So you can do 22. Great. Now that I have that set up…\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to play three cards. That\u0026rsquo;s probably how long spring is going to be. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to be doing 12 cards in total, about three per season.\nAGATHA: And now it is spring and I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw some cards.\nSATAH: First card, the three of swords. So the three of swords is something that happens around the house and it is, “Someone comes to you in need of counsel.”\nSo the thing I like about this as my first draw is that it immediately makes me think that Duck is like, “Oh, yes! Okay, so people are going to have expectations of me that aren\u0026rsquo;t just based in, like, doing material things? They are also going to assume that I have a certain amount of knowledge and general ability to help with life,” which I love as sort of a starting point.\nSo I think– I think that they– my first thought was that they come for like a political thing, you know? Um. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s something like that. It’s– it’s like– you know. This is a house that a witch lived in. Maybe the artist was even a witch, like the artist who designed it, the architect. And– so this village has had a witch and they moved on for a reason I haven\u0026rsquo;t defined yet, but it is clear that the mayor had a very specific relationship to the former– this other witch because the mayor shows up and is like, “Oh, thank goodness. Um. I\u0026rsquo;ve just been a mess without…” uh… what\u0026rsquo;s her face. My first thought was Hilda. I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at names off the top of my head. Still got my noun generator up. So. Honey; the previous witch\u0026rsquo;s name was Honey.\nThe mayor is like, “I\u0026rsquo;ve been such a mess without honey. I need you to predict something for me.” And I think one of the things that this also is, is that like the mayor is asking Duck for something that is not possible, but it\u0026rsquo;s very clear that Honey, the previous witch, was offering this service. Like there\u0026rsquo;s a certain amount of prediction and omen reading and that kind of thing that can genuinely happen. But I think the mayor is like, “I need you to tell the future to me.”\nAnd Duck kind of like stares at the mayor for a second and is like wrestling internally with like– that isn\u0026rsquo;t possible because there are many futures. Um, like what do you mean “the future” as if there\u0026rsquo;s only one? And is trying to decide like how to handle this. Like, do I break this illusion or, or do I like keep it going because clearly, like, this mayor is stressed out? And like, so do I give them sort of this comforting lie, much like Honey obviously was.\nI think Duck ultimately is like, takes a little bit of a middle road here and doesn\u0026rsquo;t like, doesn\u0026rsquo;t throw Honey under the bus, but tries to gently say like, you know, “If that\u0026rsquo;s something that Honey was able to do, then she was truly unique among witches. And I am more than happy to try and help you read the omens and that kind of thing, but I can\u0026rsquo;t promise you a specific outcome because that isn\u0026rsquo;t– that isn\u0026rsquo;t something that I… or almost anyone else can do.”\nAnd the mayor is like crestfallen. But I think that like, you know, while we\u0026rsquo;re talking, I\u0026rsquo;m like knitting and I\u0026rsquo;m– I\u0026rsquo;m like– I kind of sigh; I\u0026rsquo;m listening to like the mayor is like stressed about this, like meeting with a potential trade partner and I\u0026rsquo;m knitting and I– you know, luckily people are used to witches being a little kooky. So when I sort of put my hand out and ask for a few pieces of their hair, the mayor like hesitates for a second, but then obliges. And I sort of privately think like, I bet that Honey was asking for all sorts of shit just to make whatever she was doing seem a little more magical.\nAnd I like knit the mayor\u0026rsquo;s hair into a little– this little square that I\u0026rsquo;m making and I, and I tie it off as we\u0026rsquo;re talking and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Listen, I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you the future, but I\u0026rsquo;ve– I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to– as you\u0026rsquo;ve explained the situation. And if you go to that meeting with this as a pocket square, it will make you better at listening to other people and truly understanding what they mean. So you will be able to negotiate more openly and honestly, and it will both be more difficult to lie to you, but also more importantly, make it harder for you to misunderstand something because of your own agenda.”\nProbably put a little bit more diplomatically– like Duck has had some amount of training, but that is– that is the charm that I\u0026rsquo;m giving to the mayor. Like, you\u0026rsquo;re going to go negotiate with trade and you seem like you\u0026rsquo;re a little bit of a mess. So I\u0026rsquo;m giving you a little pocket square that will make you a– be able to understand the conversation you\u0026rsquo;re having and have the same conversation as the people you\u0026rsquo;re talking to, which will probably make it go better.\nRHIANNON: I got the page of cups. “Wildcard. Choose any prompt from this suit.” Oh, wow. Hm… I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to choose the queen here, if it\u0026rsquo;s choosing anything from this suit. It\u0026rsquo;s, “You join someone for dinner. Who is it? Do you enjoy the time?”\nI hate to do this to Viv, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to put her in an awkward situation immediately on purpose, which is that that neighbor who greeted her when she first showed up invites her over for dinner. You know. I think I\u0026rsquo;m imagining the house next door where this neighbor is from is like a family with kids, right? So I\u0026rsquo;m imagining that they invite her over for dinner and it\u0026rsquo;s just a real uncomfortable time for her. She\u0026rsquo;s simultaneously in this position of like being new in town and feeling kind of alienated and also being at a weird position of semi-authority? And also, like… finding herself treated as a peer or more by adults instead of being treated as a kid. And she\u0026rsquo;s just really not sure what to do with the situation and comes off… worrying that she was too standoffish, like having a difficult time talking to the adults, having a difficult time not being a kid anymore suddenly, right? Like being one of the adults in the room and not feeling like it. So yeah, I think she doesn\u0026rsquo;t really manage to make a connection there.\nAGATHA: The first card I drew is a two of hearts, which is– hearts is around the village. “You somehow get injured. What happened? And how do you respond?” That is so funny that that\u0026rsquo;s the first thing that happens to Ginkgo as she\u0026rsquo;s trying to establish herself in this village.\nI think what happens is that it\u0026rsquo;s late at night when someone calls on Ginkgo with an emergency. I think one of the village women is giving birth and it might be just a bit too early. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like an emergency and– well, either way, it would have been an emergency, and they ask her to go, and she does.\nAnd she goes in their boat, but because it\u0026rsquo;s so dark, um, and she is not used to the shape of the boats in this area, because where she\u0026rsquo;s from they\u0026rsquo;re sh– they’re just different. Like, where you step in is different from the boats here. So because she\u0026rsquo;s in such a rush and she knows that this is an emergency, she kind of habitually steps in the way that she would back in her home when they were heading out to take a look at patients. And that\u0026rsquo;s when she misses the boat and she falls.\nAnd, um, I think she gets a cut on her leg and also there\u0026rsquo;s a weird bruising around it, but she just disregards it. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a moment of panic where people are like, “Oh my gosh, what happened? The village witch is hurt!” Um, and– this kind of village is, uh– it’s not big, so it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where when there\u0026rsquo;s a commotion, like, a lot of people will wake up and try to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s going on and they\u0026rsquo;re more willing to come and help, but they\u0026rsquo;re also all kind of all like curious. So everyone is immediately like, what happened? And there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of hubbub.\nBut they get her back on the boat and she\u0026rsquo;s like, I\u0026rsquo;m fine. And they all go to this woman\u0026rsquo;s place where Ginkgo just very roughly wraps, bandages her own leg and then it\u0026rsquo;s like, okay, let\u0026rsquo;s focus on this childbirth. And I think the childbirth goes fine, but because Ginkgo kind of ignored her wound to deal with this, it is now festering.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is too much or too little for one prompt, but eh. [“I dunno” type sounds]\nRHIANNON: Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s see. Second card. I have drawn the four of pentacles. “It\u0026rsquo;s a festival day in the village. What sort of festival is it? What is your involvement?”\nLet me see. If it\u0026rsquo;s spring, let\u0026rsquo;s say that it\u0026rsquo;s… oh god, spring in the swamp. It\u0026rsquo;s a festival.\nOh, I think this is fun. I think it\u0026rsquo;s an agricultural festival centered around a hyper-specific local crop that she… she doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand the growing cycle. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand the cultural significance of it. It\u0026rsquo;s something that maybe grows in the water the way that, like, god, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, cranberries or lotuses or whatever grow– are very much grown, like, in water, right? I guess cranberries kind of aren\u0026rsquo;t that. They flood the field, and that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s a bog. Still, you get the idea. Just something really specific that is not– I keep putting her in situations where she feels like such an outsider, but I think it is a very hyper-local thing.\nAnd her involvement, I think– I think it\u0026rsquo;s actually one of being enthusiastically learning about it, right? Once she\u0026rsquo;s in a situation where conversation is pretty structured around the rhythms of the holiday, even if it\u0026rsquo;s an unfamiliar one, and where there\u0026rsquo;s something that is particularly of interest to her, in this case, the plants that this festival is celebrating, she\u0026rsquo;s able to really focus on that to get her through conversations. And she ends up being able to tolerate being kind of a curiosity as she is letting people teach her things about the role of this festival and the role of this very specific local plant in the cycle of holidays around here and in the ecosystem and things like that.\nAnd so, she’s sort of using– I think she\u0026rsquo;s using the holiday as a way to be able to tolerate people\u0026rsquo;s curiosity about her by also having something to be curious about and letting them feel like they have something to teach her. I think that\u0026rsquo;s more or less how it goes here.\nSATAH: Next card is Justice. So Justice is, “You find relief from a situation where you\u0026rsquo;ve been treated badly, whether recently or in the past.” Huh. That\u0026rsquo;s interesting, because I established very little mistreatment or conflict in Duck\u0026rsquo;s past.\nI think that what I want to do here is make it something that was essentially unknown to Duck. Like I think this is something that, like– the basic timeline that we\u0026rsquo;re having of these is approximately one card a month. You know?\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve been working here for a month or so, and I think someone comes to me who I haven\u0026rsquo;t really spoken to, like– I think that I\u0026rsquo;ve been surprised in some ways at how lonely this first month is. Like, I’m very… people are coming in and I\u0026rsquo;m talking to people, I\u0026rsquo;m going into the village, but I feel very apart from everyone in a way that I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting, especially when so early on it was obvious that the political apparatus of this place had come to rely on the last witch so much.\nAnd so it\u0026rsquo;s been kind of lonely, but I\u0026rsquo;m getting by, not so bad. And then I think somebody who I haven\u0026rsquo;t really spoken with comes in because, like, there\u0026rsquo;s an emergency. They are– they are hurt and they need some amount of healing. And I sort of do my magic first aid. I imagine that it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where I\u0026rsquo;ve sewn– I’ve embroidered little things into bandages for just extra pain relief or that kind of thing, you know? And I help this person.\nAnd… they, you know, stay the night there while I\u0026rsquo;m taking care of them, and we\u0026rsquo;re just kind of chatting. Then a couple days later, a bunch of people show up and they bring housewarming stuff and food and are suddenly really friendly. And I go into the village and everyone\u0026rsquo;s way friendlier suddenly, like, I am suddenly, like, part of the community.\nAnd eventually the story comes out that… gives a little bit more context to who Honey was, the previous village witch, and the ways that she was very much, like… looking for power and, like… promising the impossible and kind of acting above it all. And it becomes clear that people have been avoiding me because they think all witches are like that. Like– Honey probably isn\u0026rsquo;t even the first one who\u0026rsquo;s like that. You know, like, this has been like– this position has been occupied by a lot of people who aren\u0026rsquo;t looking to integrate into the community and are looking just for power and stature?\nAnd whoever this person was that came in with the injury just in talking with me, it became so obvious that, like– maybe they were even resigned, like they were like– I went to use one kind of bandage and they sort of sighed and I was like, “Oh, what\u0026rsquo;s up?”\nThey\u0026rsquo;re like, “Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m allergic to that. I\u0026rsquo;m allergic to those bandages. I\u0026rsquo;m allergic to that type of fiber, so I know that this is just going to be really unpleasant.”\nI\u0026rsquo;m like, “Oh, well then we can use something else. Like that\u0026rsquo;s totally fine. Thank you for telling me.” And I go and I get a different bandage. And it like– just at various parts of their care it becomes obvious that I am a willing collaborator in these conversations; that I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to just be like, “Well, this is how it\u0026rsquo;s done and this is what you need and I\u0026rsquo;m not going to listen to you.”\nI’m– I\u0026rsquo;ve accidentally started telling a healthcare fairy tale and that\u0026rsquo;s where we\u0026rsquo;re at and that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nAnd– and so word quickly spreads from this person that, like… I\u0026rsquo;m nice. That I\u0026rsquo;m nice and I\u0026rsquo;m a person and that I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in wielding my abilities over anybody and that I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in just telling people what has to be done and when.\nAnd so people start becoming nicer to me and that is the thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve been being treated badly and I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of sad. Like, Duck didn\u0026rsquo;t realize really that they were being treated badly. They were just like, “Oh, I guess, well, I guess this is what it\u0026rsquo;s like. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of sad. I don\u0026rsquo;t love the life that I\u0026rsquo;m having right now, but I guess this is what it is.” and then very quickly after this, it becomes obvious that no, that is not mandatory. People can be kind and welcome you and love you. They just have to make sure that they\u0026rsquo;re not prejudging you first. And vice versa. Wow! We’re all learning something.\nAGATHA: I am going to roll my D22 for one of the major arcana prompts and I rolled a 16, the star. “You perform a ritual for personal healing, cleansing and inspiration, giving yourself a hopeful feeling towards life. What are you optimistic about in the direction you\u0026rsquo;re going?” Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nI think the childbirth– the successful childbirth and then also the subsequent care for the mother and the baby inspire a lot of confidence in the village about this new village witch. They\u0026rsquo;re like, okay, like they definitely know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, even though they fell and that\u0026rsquo;s always kind of like an embarrassing thing. But they didn\u0026rsquo;t let that stop them. They were very focused immediately on the task at hand and they pulled it off very well, even though this is kind of like an earlier birth; an unexpected one. But the mother and the child both pulled through and they seem to be in good hands.\nSo I think the atmosphere around Ginkgo is like pretty positive at the moment. And so she\u0026rsquo;s like, okay, this is great. And she\u0026rsquo;s kind of like inspired by that to perform the ritual.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of interesting that it\u0026rsquo;s a ritual for personal healing, cleansing and inspiration. I think this one is specifically for, um– I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I really– I can really place this kind of thing in the setting that I\u0026rsquo;m drawing from. Like doing a personal healing, cleansing or inspiration kind of ritual feels very 21st century Western world? So I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to justify that. Um…\nOh, I know, I know what it is. I think it is like– she places, she places maybe one of their books, which is– which has been passed down from, like, in her family. And it is like a book of knowledge about being a witch, about herbs, about practices, so on. And she places that on, let\u0026rsquo;s say an altar. But just like an elevated space. And she basically kind of meditates and like communes with her– I guess in a way you can say it\u0026rsquo;s with her ancestors, but it\u0026rsquo;s really like she\u0026rsquo;s paying her respects, and she\u0026rsquo;s giving thanks for all the knowledge that\u0026rsquo;s been passed down. And then she\u0026rsquo;s also like flipping through it again, and looking at what is the best thing to do for her leg, because it was festering a bit. And it especially will do poorly in this kind of weather, right? Any wound in a humid and hot weather is just going to take a bit to heal. But– but she, like, in the meditation, she feels rejuvenated, and she is kind of convinced that this is– this is a part of her calling because she is doing a good job.\nRHIANNON: And let\u0026rsquo;s see. Third card. That is a six of pentacles. Oh no. “Tragedy strikes the village.” What… what is that even? And this is… probably going to be the last one for spring, so. Oh god.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s some kind of huge flood, right? Or like a flood or a weird algae bloom or something that really damages their sort of like– their harvest for the year? I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I keep coming back to the idea of this like, swamp horticulture, but I do.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s, you know– why would this result in her sort of leaving? Is, I guess, a question I\u0026rsquo;m asking.\nAnd maybe it\u0026rsquo;s that like, there\u0026rsquo;s this really big damage to the ecosystem here and people are asking her to, you know, she feels obligated to help with it, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually not her specialty, weirdly enough. She knows a lot about plants, but not in a way that helps with something like this. You would need somebody who like sort of specializes in plant-based magic to help deal with this kind of disaster. And so I think she kind of winds up feeling kind of dejected about it, right? And then just, you know, sending a letter to, you know, the like order that sent her out here saying, hey, send somebody else who knows what to do with this problem. And I think she moves on without really having made much of a connection.\nAGATHA: And then I\u0026rsquo;m going to pull another card, another hearts. This is six of hearts. So this is again around the village. “You find a nearby cave. What do you find inside?” Huh, that\u0026rsquo;s a good question.\nYeah. I\u0026rsquo;m going to say that there\u0026rsquo;s kind of like a grotto area that is not too far from, um– from the village. I think a lot of the young people in the village like to go and fish there. And one day Peony invites Ginkgo to come along with them. And it\u0026rsquo;s kind of an interesting thing where a lot of the, um, communication between the village elder and Ginkgo has been through Peony. And it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, this thing where it\u0026rsquo;s like– technically, Ginkgo is at the same social level as the village elder, but because the village elder is so much older, it\u0026rsquo;s like– there\u0026rsquo;s like a pride thing going on, and a face thing where she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to kind of give up that– that– the face of being older and having that social status. So instead she\u0026rsquo;s sending, sending her child to– to kind of do the communicating and do the socializing, that kind of stuff.\nI think Ginkgo is aware that this is happening. She\u0026rsquo;s not– she gets the sense of what this is, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think she has really thought about, like, what she should do about it, or like, how to kind of either alleviate the situation or turn it to her advantage. She hasn\u0026rsquo;t really thought about any of that. She\u0026rsquo;s just kind of like, “Oh yeah, this is kind of weird, but I kind of see why it\u0026rsquo;s happening and I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do anything about it,” is the situation.\nAnyway, back to this grotto and the fishing that a lot of the young people are doing. I think the young people are like kind of reverent of Ginkgo, but they\u0026rsquo;re also kind of like– they don\u0026rsquo;t– they don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know how to handle interacting with her because she is so important. She\u0026rsquo;s the village witch sent by the school of witches and so they need to pay her respect, but she\u0026rsquo;s also the same age as them. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, how do we, how do we interact with that? And Ginkgo has taken a kind of like a, I am– I am kind of distant, but I am also willing to partake in activities sort of approach?\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s like, they don\u0026rsquo;t feel like they can joke around with her the way that they can comfortably joke around with each other, but they\u0026rsquo;re also like not too intimidated by her. So she goes and everyone is just kind of free to like look around and then Peony is like, “Oh, do you want to– do you want to fish or do you, what would you like to do?”\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, maybe I want to see, look around and see if there are any herbs that I can gather or yeah, if there\u0026rsquo;s any materials. ‘Cause in these kinds of traditional medicine, it\u0026rsquo;s not just plants that get used, so she\u0026rsquo;s also kind of like looking for specific kind of– maybe like crustaceans that she can find in this grotto.\nSo yeah, she\u0026rsquo;s looking around and, um, and she sees this like gaping cave. And I think when she sees it, that\u0026rsquo;s when Peony also reappears behind her and just asks like, “Oh, I… hm. This cave, like, I don\u0026rsquo;t really remember seeing it, but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot around here. Do you want to go look together?”\nGinkgo says yes. So they go inside together and I think what they find is a lingzhi. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what this is called in English. I suppose I can look it up, but it\u0026rsquo;s basically some kind of like a fung– fungi– some kind of mushroom thing that is very expensive and also is said to have a lot of health benefits. Like the kind of thing that you would like gift old people as like a very expensive gift to like pay respects, that kind of thing.\n“Also known as Reishi or Ganoderma Lingzhi or Ganoderma is a polypore fungus native to East Asia.” Okay. Anyway, yeah. So that\u0026rsquo;s what, that\u0026rsquo;s what they find. And it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty impressive.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s only one, is the thing. Like these are very– these are not common. And I think for a moment Ginkgo wants to keep it for herself. But then she realizes that that would really sour the relationship with everyone else in this village. So she offers to split it with Peony and Peony is like, “Oh no, no, no, I can\u0026rsquo;t.” And then she– then then Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s like, “No, I insist.” And then with that, they do split it. And then the village elder invites Ginkgo over for dinner for the first time. And that\u0026rsquo;s kind of when they have their first conversation over the dinner table. It\u0026rsquo;s, like, very awkward, but, but it happened. And it’s– that\u0026rsquo;s also kind of like a signal to the rest of the village.\nSATAH: So, probably our last card of spring. Does reversing mean anything in this game? No, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it does. So I drew the queen of wands. So queen of wands is yet again around the house. “An animal is outside your door. What is it and how do you respond?”\nWell, this is perfect. It\u0026rsquo;s that meerkat that doesn\u0026rsquo;t like me. And I think what I\u0026rsquo;ve realized, uh, through the narrative we\u0026rsquo;ve built so far in spring, is that the meerkat– it\u0026rsquo;s true that I\u0026rsquo;m not the most natural animal communicator, and I think it quickly becomes obvious that– you know, what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned here is that that isn\u0026rsquo;t why the meerkat doesn\u0026rsquo;t like me. The meerkat doesn\u0026rsquo;t like me because the meerkat is a– is an Iago looking for a Jafar or whatever. Is that– does that fit? I don\u0026rsquo;t know what plot relevance I just described. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I saw Aladdin.\nBut the meerkat– the meerkat is a schemer. The meerkat comes back, um, has been away, you know, doing schemes and shows up and is surprised to see me and is like, “Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Right, right, right, right, right. Honey told me– Honey told me about this. So you\u0026rsquo;re in on it, right?”\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Um… so I think Honey actually had to go pretty unexpectedly. So I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get to… to talk… talk with her, but do you want to come in?”\nAnd the meerkat is just like scandalized and like horrified by this. And I think it, uh, it quickly becomes obvious that the– that Honey and this meerkat were, were doing some sort of like intense scheming for, ah, riches, probably. It\u0026rsquo;s usually riches. And I\u0026rsquo;m like not interested because it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s something that will hurt, you know, the people of the town or at least not benefit them? I– it\u0026rsquo;s almost certainly involved, like giving the mayor bad advice, right? Like being like, “Oh, here\u0026rsquo;s the future: you have to vote ‘no’ on this thing you were going to vote ‘yes’ on because that\u0026rsquo;s what is in the future. That\u0026rsquo;s the only option. I know that you think you\u0026rsquo;re going to vote yes, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the future and you\u0026rsquo;re going to vote no. It\u0026rsquo;s probably a long game. Uh, so do that, you know.”\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been– they were, they were scheming and, and doing terrible things and, uh, and I\u0026rsquo;m, you know, not interested in doing that. And I think the thing that this actually sets up is that, um, I\u0026rsquo;m going to leave this– this town and go somewhere else for summer. And I think part of the reason why is that I realize I\u0026rsquo;m under qualified for the political intrigue necessary for this. And so I like, send a letter to the order and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Hey, so I\u0026rsquo;ve been here for three months and I have uncovered a pretty deep well of corruption in the political apparatus of this town. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to enable it, but oh boy, this isn\u0026rsquo;t one of the things I can fix! Please send somebody else! Or like, a few people.”\nAnd so I– I ask for, uh– they send like, they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Okay, yep, this will happen sometimes. Um, we\u0026rsquo;ll send a few people who can, you know, investigate and actually like really make things right. Good for you for not sticking your fingers deeper into that pie and getting caught up in it. ‘Cause it sounds like from the stories you\u0026rsquo;re telling about this meerkat… oh boy, you would have been in over your head, kid.”\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Yep. I’m… I\u0026rsquo;ma head out” and that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s my spring. I wait for the new small council of investigators– of an– of investigatory witches to arrive and we spend a couple of days together. You know, I catch them up. I tell them as much as I can about where to find that meerkat, who has disappeared again. And I\u0026rsquo;m off to settle somewhere new for summer.\nAGATHA: I\u0026rsquo;m debating if I should draw another card or if I should be like, okay, that\u0026rsquo;s spring. Spring is over. I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw another card because I kind of feel like I want to try to see if there\u0026rsquo;s another suit that I can draw.\nOkay. This one is a clubs. So around the home, it\u0026rsquo;s a five of clubs. “Write a letter. Who is it for and what do you want to tell them?”\nOh boy. Um, this is definitely a letter to her– to Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s ex-betrothed. It was kind of like a family arrangement, but they also knew each other. So it wasn\u0026rsquo;t like, uh, okay, our families decide this and we just go along with it, um, which is the expectation generally, but it was also that they both knew each other and they both were agreeable towards it.\nSo I think what happened was that, uh, her ex-betrothed, um, was offered, um, an opportunity within the city as some kind of… like a witch like, uh, position as well. Uh, but obviously in the city, it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s a much better job. Um, and, uh, with that offer is also an offer of marriage. I think whoever offered it, they were aware of this betrothal, but they\u0026rsquo;re, they\u0026rsquo;re like way higher station than either of these two, either Ginkgo or her ex basically. And they were like, “Yeah, I know of it. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you can deal with it. But anyway, I can offer you this very good position, but you have to, uh… to kind of like secure your loyalty, you would have to, uh, marry my, uh, my child.”\nAnd, um, and I think the ex agreed because it\u0026rsquo;s just such a good opportunity, first of all, to have that position. And second of all, to now get this connection, uh, that is basically like an unbreakable bond with this very, very influential individual. Or at least this individual that is of a much higher standing than I, either Ginkgo or her ex were– like, their families were.\nSo yeah, she– he like broke it off with Ginkgo and then was like, “I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but you understand, right?”\nAnd so in this letter, Ginkgo, um, she talks about how this place, um, is very similar to the city that they grew up in, in terms of their climate. And then she talks about her success, um, as a village witch in delivering the baby and also dealing with various people\u0026rsquo;s, um, ailments. And also in terms of like cleansing, um, locations and houses. And then she talks about the lingzhi that she found.\nShe does not talk about her loneliness or her, um, discomfort with, um, the lack of infrastructure in this village. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t talk about the awkwardness with the village elder. Um, and the way that the village elder keeps trying to assert her own social dominance over Ginkgo. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t talk about any of that. Instead, she, um, ends the letter with, uh, with a reference to Peony and how beautiful and vivacious and funny she is and how, um, how much she feels like– how much Ginkgo feels like she has found her calling.\nAnd she sends that letter off and immediately regrets it.\nAnd that ends spring for Ginkgo.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

With me again are Agatha C and Rhiannon Daly. Check out all the relevant links in the episode description.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve decided that this is as good a time as any to finally mention on air that there is a Patreon for the show. I\u0026rsquo;m keeping it very low key for now because I\u0026rsquo;m trying a new fun experiment where I don\u0026rsquo;t immediately burn myself out on every single project I ever do at any point ever. But there is a monthly stream for patrons where I play a solo game, which patrons also get to vote on. The VODS and edited audio version of those will be publicly posted at some point, probably a few weeks after the stream. You can get those by signing up on Patreon as a free member. I\u0026rsquo;m kind of a weirdo about paywalling stuff, so figuring all of this out is awkward for me, but I appreciate whatever support you\u0026rsquo;re able to give me. At the time of writing, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent 23 hours editing these five episodes, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t even started to make the music yet, or obviously edited all of these interstitials and things, so like, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work! And it\u0026rsquo;s fulfilling. And also, if you can throw me a couple bucks, thank you. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, thank you as well for being with me right here, right now, in this exact moment that we are sharing together.\nSo last week was spring, this week is summer. Two of our witches are going to try their luck in a new village, and one is going to stay right where they are. Let\u0026rsquo;s hear those second towns get built, and then see if we can\u0026rsquo;t bask in that heat a little.\nGAME RHIANNON: Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s move on to summer.\nSATAH: So it\u0026rsquo;s summer, and I\u0026rsquo;m moving on, baby. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll a d6 to get a new location. [Die clatter] Two. Forest. Great. I already answered a few of the sort of location questions. Leaving one village to find another because the last one is a different type of movie than I want to be the protagonist in. It\u0026rsquo;s a political thriller, and I\u0026rsquo;m, uh… I’m just not an action type, you know? I I– I don’t have– don\u0026rsquo;t have the head for it, for the conspiracy and the intrigue.\nAGATHA: I did not decide at the end of season for spring whether I was going to move on from my last village or not. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think I will, actually. I want to stay in the swamp land village for another season because we just did the dry season, so now I want to do the wet season, which is summer. Yeah, so Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s journey continues.\nSATAH: “Who will you miss?” I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve… I didn\u0026rsquo;t make like close-close friends, but I\u0026rsquo;ll miss the villagers. We started getting along really well, you know, in that second month, and started to really form good friendships. And so I think like– I\u0026rsquo;m not swearing this town off, by any means. It\u0026rsquo;s like, I will be traveling back through here again, and I will visit all of you, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s a few of them even– probably the person who came in with the emergency, you know, just for the narrative circles and whatever, is like, “Hey, after we get all this sorted out, maybe you can come back!”\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Maybe. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the dry air agrees with me, but… you know, I know that I\u0026rsquo;ll see you again.”\nAnd what\u0026rsquo;s my new house like? I\u0026rsquo;m going to do it again. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a D4 on their examples. I got “built into a cave!” That\u0026rsquo;s so… it\u0026rsquo;s very funny that I got “house on stilts” for the desert and “built into a cave” for the forest.\nI think– given that, it’s– the image I\u0026rsquo;m getting is that this village is in sort of a glade in the forest, and so I\u0026rsquo;m in a cave just inside the forest. I\u0026rsquo;m technically on the outskirts, but like, truly not very far. Everything has to be quite close because there just isn\u0026rsquo;t that much space, and things feel more private than they are. The denseness of the forest makes it very easy, actually, to get privacy even in such a small amount of space. Um, but, still, be careful, because you\u0026rsquo;re not that far from other people, and voices can carry, depending on the wind.\nRHIANNON: Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll another D6 for the location that she ends up in in the summer. Four. Okay. So that\u0026rsquo;s the mountains.\nAnd… let\u0026rsquo;s see. “What is the house like?” I think– I\u0026rsquo;m imagining this image of, as she\u0026rsquo;s kind of leaving the swamp village dejected, feeling like she just wasn\u0026rsquo;t the person they needed for the kind of problems that they had, she ends up flying a pretty long distance, maybe making a couple of stops on the way there, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s like a several day trip. And flying eventually up to this village on a mountainside, right? And so…\nI think in this case, the house is– it\u0026rsquo;s like a sort of cottage built on like, like a terraced flat area on the mountainside in– not on the mountainside, but you know, up there, on the outer edge of the village, right? I\u0026rsquo;m imagining it sort of being like– she has this, um– this house that is a bit higher elevation than the rest of the village, so the people have to kind of walk up uphill to get to her, and she can see the whole place from where her house is, from where this cottage is, and she has like this terrace, this like sort of like earthen terrace that\u0026rsquo;s built up so that she can have like a garden up there.\nSATAH: “Do you have a garden?” Not so much a garden, just the like– the natural plants that grow around the cave. I– oh, I like the idea that there just like, there\u0026rsquo;s sort of a mud room of the cave that has like– there\u0026rsquo;s moss being cultivated on the inside, very specifically, like moss varieties that have been like– of different colours that have been cultivated to do like artwork on the walls. It\u0026rsquo;s all natural, made of moss, and it\u0026rsquo;s essentially self-sustaining, but it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing that like, as a person living there, I can sort of like mould and like shift a little bit, like depending on which areas you like pay more attention to, it can look a little bit different.\nAnd I think actually, for some reason, what I\u0026rsquo;m realizing there is, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m the only one living here specifically. I think that this is actually one of those things where like, I got roomies. I got witch roomies. And I think that what it is is that they are not focused on the people of the village. These are like, forest-ass witches. Maybe one\u0026rsquo;s even an elf. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re very much like, “We are here because this is a source of immense natural power and all of these people live here– that is also why they live here, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t realize it–” I think that\u0026rsquo;s probably the elf, they can be a little condescending– “and they need help, and they deserve it, and somebody needs to take care of it, and them. It\u0026rsquo;s not going to be us. We sort of got– we have some high level stuff to pay attention to.”\nAgain, higher stakes. Something I seem to be establishing about Duck is that they have a tendency to be just on the sidelines of movies that are a lot more intense. Like their roommates probably have saved the world a couple times, or are going to, and that\u0026rsquo;s sort of like what they\u0026rsquo;re paying attention to, and Duck\u0026rsquo;s like, “Ooh. Haha… Uh, no, I would love to… so you have to go save the world. Are your shoes comfortable? Or do you need insoles? I can make insoles. Somebody needs to make you some insoles. I\u0026rsquo;ll do it.” You know? So that\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;ve got going on.\nRHIANNON: And let\u0026rsquo;s see, “is it haunted or is there an animal friend that comes to visit?” I imagine there are probably… I\u0026rsquo;m going to say there\u0026rsquo;s a goat here. Not a goat that\u0026rsquo;s like, you know, magical in any way. It\u0026rsquo;s just– they\u0026rsquo;re up in the mountains. There\u0026rsquo;s a goat. There’s a goat that won\u0026rsquo;t stop hanging around her house and isn\u0026rsquo;t really anyone\u0026rsquo;s livestock. It\u0026rsquo;s just there.\nAnd she sees– I think this goat is who she sees first as she gets in, right?She knows where she\u0026rsquo;s going. She kind of bypasses the rest of the village. She\u0026rsquo;s maybe a little afraid to talk to the people there after her first experience in the swamp village. So she just goes right up to her cottage and there\u0026rsquo;s a goat standing right in front of the door, like, blocking her way, and she has to kind of like negotiate the process of convincing this goat to get out of her way so she can get in. And, you know, maybe she\u0026rsquo;s eventually able to do this. She offers it like some kind of snack to kind of lead it away from the door a little bit, but the goat\u0026rsquo;s still just standing there outside once she gets in. She\u0026rsquo;s like, well, okay. I guess that– I guess this goat is here. Just going to hang out in the front yard.\nYeah, so I think that\u0026rsquo;s her initial impression of the village, is meeting this goat and being like already less alone than she was, but also without having met a single human being yet. And also it\u0026rsquo;s not like the goat is super friendly. It\u0026rsquo;s just very stubbornly sticking around. So that\u0026rsquo;s kind of what I\u0026rsquo;m imagining for her as she gets there.\nSATAH: “Is the house haunted or is there an animal friend?” I think the house is probably a little haunted, but not in a way that is kind of my concern. You know? Like, again, that\u0026rsquo;s sort of the stuff that my roomies are dealing with. And so it\u0026rsquo;s like, “Just so you know, on the full moon, like, if you don\u0026rsquo;t fall asleep by a specific time, you will see an apparition. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe it\u0026rsquo;s lies. Don\u0026rsquo;t promise it anything.” And it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of like, “and we really prefer to have dishes done sort of at the end of the night to wake up to a clean kitchen. Uh, and that\u0026rsquo;s it.” That kind of thing.\n“Initial impression of the village and who do you meet first?” I think it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful. For some reason, I very much like have been assuming that Duck is from somewhere a little bit more woodsy. And so I think that there\u0026rsquo;s there\u0026rsquo;s an enormous amount of like– there\u0026rsquo;s– there\u0026rsquo;s some comfort that comes here. And so I think it\u0026rsquo;s like, ah, yes, this is beautiful.\nAnd I think that it\u0026rsquo;s– something that really impresses them is how compact it is. Like I think they\u0026rsquo;re from somewhere that\u0026rsquo;s woodsy, but elevated, you know, like it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like everybody lived up in the trees and whatever. And here, it is a glade. So everyone\u0026rsquo;s living in this forest, but on the ground and very close together. And that\u0026rsquo;s like new and exciting and cool for Duck.\nAnd I think the first person I meet… I think that I just like– I like the image of, um– like what I said earlier about the… there is privacy to be found in the forest, just because it is so dense, but people are still very close together. The idea that I was sort of like coming up through the path and there\u0026rsquo;s like some sort of goofy thing… like, somebody pops out onto the path and is like, “Hi! Oh my god, are you the new– are you the witch? We heard that you were coming in.” and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Oh, yeah, hi. Uhh! Nice– nice to meet you.” Like these people just, like– somebody literally popped out of the forest, and so I\u0026rsquo;m like, you know, trying to just catch up and they\u0026rsquo;re just kind of gossiping a little bit.\nAnd then somebody like pops out on the other side of the path and is like, “Deanna is that you talk– oh! Oh my god, you\u0026rsquo;re the new witch!” And like just three different small groups of people all pop out because they were all like quietly having their own time. And so my first impression of like all of these people is like, they are very curious. And incredibly nice! Um, but it\u0026rsquo;s like– I think I quickly am like, ooh, I should, um– I should be prepared sort of at all times to like, not know if I\u0026rsquo;m alone, because I thought that I was, but then six people popped out with a seltzer in– they’re– they’re all having picnics. Or fucking. Or whatever they\u0026rsquo;re doing. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. You can do both of those things at the same time, if you\u0026rsquo;re brave.\nRHIANNON: See, as far as some of things in particular…\nSATAH: “The warmer winds of summer swirl around you, embracing the world so full of life that was nurtured through spring. The sun kisses the earth as barefooted children delight in running through the warm dirt.”\nSATAH \u0026amp; AGATHA: “How do you prepare your home for summer?”\nAGATHA: “What do you enjoy about summer?”\nSATAH: “What is something you\u0026rsquo;ve learned since you started your journey?”\nAGATHA: Preparing for the wet season has a lot to do with patching the roof to make sure that it can withstand day after day of rain? And heavy rain, too. This is not the kind that gently mists down. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of rain that every day when it when it falls, it kind of pelts your skin and– and it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit painful because they\u0026rsquo;re just so heavy. So the roofs definitely need to be redone generally. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve decided on what kind of roofs they are, but I imagine that they\u0026rsquo;re just thatched in some way from the materials that are nearby.\nSo this is kind of like a village wide activity. I think it\u0026rsquo;s actually– uh, it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly like a festival, but it is– there always gets to a point in the seasons when people are like, yes, OK, now it\u0026rsquo;s time for roof thatching. And then everyone pitches in to help, uh– help do it for each other. And it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, uh, yeah, like all the kids get involved as well, and then probably at the end of it, everyone tends to sit down for shared meal and Ginkgo takes part as well.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think she\u0026rsquo;s very good at it. She again came from a family that is better off than the general economic status of this village. So they I don\u0026rsquo;t think they had an activity that was similar to this, or like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a group activity whenever they needed to trash their roofs. They had different materials, as well. And whatever was needed– needed to be done was usually done by servants. So Ginkgo is kind of like, “Wow, this is all very new!” And she struggles a little. But I think the the villagers actually find it kind of endearing that– that she\u0026rsquo;s bad at this. And there\u0026rsquo;s definitely some bonding time where her and Peony get to do that together.\nSATAH: “How do you prepare your home for summer?” I like the idea that I– you know, come up to the cave and the other two witches are doing some sort of prep labour? Like I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of this as like– I mean, we live on the ground, so it\u0026rsquo;s probably not super rainy. But, like, they\u0026rsquo;re sort of like shifting plants around in a way that– ooh, I bet that– I mean, they\u0026rsquo;re they\u0026rsquo;re doing plant magic that\u0026rsquo;s like, coaxing vines to sit slightly differently to like, give more shade. And they\u0026rsquo;re, um, establishing anti bug charms and that kind of thing.\nAnd I walk up and they\u0026rsquo;re like doing this. And they like greet me and they\u0026rsquo;re excited to see me and I just hop in because this is something I understand. Like, this is very, like, practical hands-on stuff that I\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of. And so I\u0026rsquo;m able to like, just hop in and start just bug proofing and– and temperature proofing the– the– cave in a way that has to happen at the beginning of summer.\nRHIANNON: “How do you prepare your home for summer?” Summer up in the mountains is interesting. Right? In that kind of high elevation environment, it\u0026rsquo;s– I imagine that the summer is probably kind of like wet and temperate, right? Yeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s like a little bit humid, but it\u0026rsquo;s not it\u0026rsquo;s not that hot because of the elevation. Right. And so I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably a lot of like, maybe she gets in and the sheets on the badge are, you know, like the really heavy winter ones that whoever was here last was using, right. And all of the things in the house indicate that like the last time someone was living here, it was winter. And so she has to kind of air things out and get rid of the dust and make it less oriented around dealing with the cold and like sealing the whole place off and stuff. So she\u0026rsquo;s opening the windows, she\u0026rsquo;s sweeping, things like that.\nSATAH: “What do you enjoy about summer?”\nI immediately have the thought of Duck, like, waxing poetic about light fabrics? Like, it\u0026rsquo;s established that they like– their favourite season is fall. But, you know, they admit in almost a like guilty pleasure kind of way that there is something that is so wonderful and appealing to them about fabrics that are designed to be seen through? That, like, there\u0026rsquo;s something so fascinating and beautiful about fabrics that exist almost to pretend to hide the thing that they cover? To provide protection for the thing that they cover and to decorate the thing that they cover, but also to allow the thing that they cover– the body they cover, the house they cover, the window, whatever– to show through naturally. And so I think there is something that\u0026rsquo;s just very appealing about that to Duck.\nAGATHA: So what does Ginkgo enjoy about summer? I think she doesn\u0026rsquo;t mind the rain and how heavy it gets. It\u0026rsquo;s relentless, yes, and it does tend to be pretty hot. But the heat doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother her, really. She\u0026rsquo;s used to that. And I think she finds the noise very comforting, actually. So every evening when the frogs just get so loud during rainy season, and then also during the day when the rain is just hitting the roof, there\u0026rsquo;s something about the rhythm of it that is very comforting and very familiar for her that she tends to like. And there\u0026rsquo;s also– when you\u0026rsquo;re falling asleep and you hear the sound of the rain and you know that your roof is thatched, that is also quite comforting.\nRHIANNON: “What do you enjoy about summer?” I think for her, the thing she enjoys about summer is, like I was saying before, she has this kind of rhythm to the year where during half the year she gets to focus on her sort of magical specialty because, like, people are more likely to get sick or hurt in a lot of places during the winter. But then this is where she is in full swing in the other direction and is focusing on her more mundane housekeeping tasks and things that she does for villages, things that she does for herself, taking care of the garden and stuff like that. So I think something she enjoys about summer is being able to swing fully into that side of what her job is, I guess.\nSATAH: “What is something you\u0026rsquo;ve learned since you started your journey?” Well, gosh.\nI think that– this is interesting because it\u0026rsquo;s getting reinforced here, where like, you know, at the last place– they started to really learn, like, that the position they occupy might not always be the one that they think they\u0026rsquo;re occupying? That they might not only be in the shadow of the person who came before them, but they might be forced, just by virtue of how other people see them– how other people– the way that other people assume that they are, the position that other people assume they\u0026rsquo;re occupying– they might be forced to do that. Like, in the last place, they were forced to be a part of politics because the mayor kept asking for help with stuff, and that that happened because that was just an assumption that the mayor made, that this is something that somebody in Duck\u0026rsquo;s position does. And so they\u0026rsquo;re just learning a lot about, like, being careful to… understand the assumptions that they\u0026rsquo;re working with and that other people are working with? And I think that this is being reinforced just in like, moving in with these two other witches, right, who have these really like grand scale concerns. Um. Just seeing the contrast there, like seeing where their focus is, makes Duck like, “Whoa, yeah, okay, I have to be really careful about setting expectations and making sure that I understand other people\u0026rsquo;s expectations. Otherwise I can get caught up in something without even knowing that it\u0026rsquo;s already happened.”\nRHIANNON: “What is something you\u0026rsquo;ve learned since you started your journey?” I don\u0026rsquo;t know about that. I think that something she\u0026rsquo;s learned is that just being interested in what\u0026rsquo;s happening around her and good at what she does doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like enough to her in the way that she kind of expected it would. So she feels a little bit of a pressure to like, figure out what it is that she\u0026rsquo;s missing, about what it is that makes a good village witch.\nAGATHA: Um, what she\u0026rsquo;s learned since starting her journey is that people are very resourceful, even without– even without magic and even without wealth, necessarily, and better resources– for example, the building materials that she\u0026rsquo;s used to– but people are still able to figure out a way to live with nature, to live amongst their environment by working together. And that has been, I think, a bit of a humbling experience for Ginkgo.\nSATAH: So let\u0026rsquo;s do some cards.\nRHIANNON: Okay, so–\nAGATHA: Okay, so I have that set.\nRHIANNON: Going back to the cards.\nAGATHA: Now it is time to draw my card.\nSATAH: Because they\u0026rsquo;re tarot cards especially, I really just feel like they should be laid out and then flipped, you know?\nRHIANNON: Let\u0026rsquo;s draw our first card for summer. I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn the ten of swords. Well then, that\u0026rsquo;s a much less scary prompt than I would expect for the ten of swords, which is really a very negative looking card. “You take a spell bath using herbs, crystals, and maybe even some fruit to prepare the water. What comfort or healing do you hope to receive from the ritual?”\nI think what she\u0026rsquo;s doing here is she gets in and the first thing she notices is that the mountains, like, look and feel and smell very different from where she just was, but she still kind of smells like the swamp. And she feels like, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s weighing on her in a way that\u0026rsquo;s more– more metaphysical, maybe, than just the literal, like, she kind of smells bad. [Laughing] So, she kind of wants to wash that off of her a little bit and sort of integrate with her new environment instead of carrying the old one around with her so much.\nSo yeah, I think that\u0026rsquo;s what she does. I think she maybe looks around her garden, sees what, like, local plants there are, like local herbs that she could use to kind of infuse it with the– with the vibes of what\u0026rsquo;s going on outside her house instead of way back where she was. And she just wants to kind of sit in this mountain environment. And it\u0026rsquo;s probably one of the first things she does as she gets in.\nYou know, at the last place, I kind of imagine that she never fully unpacked her personal stuff, even the small amount of it that she had, mostly just unpacked her work stuff. And again, she’s, you know– we\u0026rsquo;re getting this kind of first card situation before she\u0026rsquo;s unpacked anything that\u0026rsquo;s really personal to her.\nAGATHA: The first card I draw is a nine of diamonds, which is also an around the village card. Nine of diamonds. “Take a walk around the outskirts of the village, circling the community with protective rituals and blessings.” Okay.\nUm– yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s what Ginkgo does. I think it is just a standard day. And Ginkgo does that. She would go around and place specific herbs and then also like specific materials in the four corners of the village that correspond, um, to… there\u0026rsquo;s like a directional aspect to it. So the north, south, east, and west. In each of– in each section, she would place different materials because they are for either inviting good luck or for warding off bad luck.\nAnd when she does this, the kids in the village that are more used to her and also find her not very scary would kind of follow her around and like– they want– they would be hounding her with questions, but she would tell them that she needs silence and that this is very serious. And then they\u0026rsquo;re kind of like, “Aww…” but then she would be like– I think she would reiterate her point and then try to be serious about it. And then maybe one of the parents that are around would take pity on her and then shush all of the kids. Because really, Ginkgo does not have that kind of authority with the kids, specifically.\nSATAH: So our first card is the nine of cups. This is around the village. Nine is, “You find an item someone lost. What is it? Do you return it to them?” Huh.\nAn item someone lost. So– my thought of this is kind of a sad one for some reason. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that like– I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s a piece of clothing, right? Like it\u0026rsquo;s a hat that just got blown off and I find it in the middle of the woods. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know why this was my first thought, but it\u0026rsquo;s like– I find this hat and part of the– there\u0026rsquo;s like a ribbon on it that is falling off. And so I fix it and then go and find the person whose hat it is. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Hey, I found your hat and don\u0026rsquo;t worry. I fixed that ribbon that was falling off.”\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, “You what?! No! I swap that ribbon out almost every single day. This just like… it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be loose. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take it off. Like, like this just made it, you just made this worse.”\nAnd I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I want to put Duck in that position. Sorry, Duck. But I think that\u0026rsquo;s what it is. I find this hat and I think that I\u0026rsquo;m fixing it, but I’ll– actually, I\u0026rsquo;m like doing something that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been asked to do. And this person is like upset with me when I return it.\nAnd I think like this person also is being a bit of a jerk, I think, because I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have assumed. I\u0026rsquo;ll fix it.”\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, “No. You\u0026rsquo;ve done enough.” which is like a very overdramatic thing to do when somebody\u0026rsquo;s just like put a couple stitches on your hat they could just take out. And so like, they\u0026rsquo;re not being nice. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have done it without asking, but also like, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be such a jerk to me. But still, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a like, Oh, right. Okay. I got to be careful about also assum– right, again, setting expectations and all that kind of thing– like I have to be careful about assuming that–\n[Loud Garold meows] Hi buddy. Um…\nYeah, I just have to be careful about assuming what is what is desired from me, because everyone is– everyone is– is– is individuals and has their own specific things. And even if I\u0026rsquo;m trying to be helpful, I have to ask first.\n[Gentle Garold purrs]\nAGATHA: So yeah, I will move on to my second prompt, which I will take from the– the major arcana. And that is a seven, the chariot. “You find yourself in a situation where you need to take charge and lead. How do you feel about that? Is leading easy or difficult for you?”\nI think that one of the young people in the village has been plagued with nightmares recently. Is it a youth or is it a child? Let\u0026rsquo;s say that it is a youth actually that has been plagued with nightmares. And it is the kind where they– they sleep and they cannot awake, but they\u0026rsquo;re clearly experiencing nightmares and thrashing around and crying out. And during these nightmares, they just cannot be woken up. And then later on, when they do wake up, they\u0026rsquo;re exhausted and just sort of haunted and they can never explain what they experience in the nightmares. It\u0026rsquo;s unclear whether they don\u0026rsquo;t actually remember or whether it was just so upsetting or disturbing that they can\u0026rsquo;t or won\u0026rsquo;t put it to words.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say that it is actually, um– Peony\u0026rsquo;s younger brother. So Peony, the village elder\u0026rsquo;s daughter, um, her younger brother is the one that\u0026rsquo;s experiencing this.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s gotten to the point where it is clearly a thing that is not passing and the whole family is getting very concerned. So they ask Ginkgo to come and deal with the situation.\nI think this actually is much easier for Ginkgo to deal with. Ginkgo tells the family– well, Ginkgo goes– I mean… she\u0026rsquo;s heard about this. She\u0026rsquo;s heard the screaming at night because this is not a big village. And so she kind of already knows a little about the situation and she also hears the kids talking about it or some of the other villagers gossiping about it as they go around their work. They still view Ginkgo as an outsider, somewhat– an assigned witch from the government, basically. But she\u0026rsquo;s kind of done enough things with everyone and kind of proven her worth in a way where they won\u0026rsquo;t avoid her when they\u0026rsquo;re gossiping.\nSo yeah, she knows about it and she goes in. I think she\u0026rsquo;s comfortable telling the village elder and also Peony what to do. Maybe this is one of the evenings where things are kind of escalating, where he is thrashing around so much that they\u0026rsquo;re scared that he\u0026rsquo;s going to hurt himself; it\u0026rsquo;s so violent. So yes, Ginkgo goes in, tells them to hold him down and then ask them very briefly what kind of things have been happening. What has he been saying, the frequency, the usual doctor things that you might ask. And then she makes everyone gather the things that she needs.\nAnd then also I think she, um– it\u0026rsquo;s probably a combination. It\u0026rsquo;s not exactly an exorcism, but she does a combination of applying herbs and then also, um, performs a ritual to kind of clear this building, this house, of– of the bad energies that could possibly be there. And it does involve getting people to go and stand in different places while she chants. She chants and then applies the herbs that are needed.\nAnd yeah, I think this is the first time that she has ever told the village elder what to do. And I think the village elder is uncomfortable with it, but also is more concerned about his son than what is basically the change in their power dynamics. But Ginkgo is not uncomfortable with it. She has grown up with the expectation that she will be in charge in one way or another, to the point where she kind of expects it, and then when people don\u0026rsquo;t give her the respect, that\u0026rsquo;s what makes her uncomfortable, because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to fight for it, because she never had to. So yeah, in this situation, she\u0026rsquo;s like much more in her element, when everyone just– would listen to her.\nRHIANNON: Second card. That is the page of pentacles, which is “Wild card. Choose any prompt from this suit.”\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m going to take something that gets her more socially involved with people around here. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to pick five. “You visit the village bakery. What is your favourite food there?”\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see. I think something that she sees in the village bakery is like a bread that she kind of doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with, but she\u0026rsquo;s curious about it, right? She goes in and she sees this bread that\u0026rsquo;s, like, a little bit tougher than she would normally expect for a bread that you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to eat on its own. So I think this is kind of what gets her to start opening up to people a little bit.\nSo she asks the baker, what\u0026rsquo;s the deal with this? Is this like, a local specialty? And the baker explains to her that this is a bread that is specifically made to be put in a bowl with, like, a soup that is common in the area, right? Thinking about the mountains, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about people needing kind of this like very hearty food working outside at high altitude, right? And so I\u0026rsquo;m imagining the baker just explaining to her, yeah, like there\u0026rsquo;s this soup that is a very common meal around here. Normally people will put this bread in there and it\u0026rsquo;s tough because it\u0026rsquo;s expected to get softer as it kind of sits there. And it\u0026rsquo;s also like strongly flavored because it then like gives some flavour to the soup and things like that. That gets her kind of asking questions.\nAnd I think, you know, maybe the baker is somebody she feels a little bit more comfortable around now and can kind of start to make friends with, um– as they\u0026rsquo;re talking about the way that the local climate affects people\u0026rsquo;s food habits, affects agriculture, stuff like that.\nAgain, it\u0026rsquo;s summer, right, like, so that outdoor work portion of her job is in full swing. And so she\u0026rsquo;s really interested in getting more involved with that here than she did at the last place.\nSATAH: The second card is a… not an actual card. It is a little title card that was in the pack still. So second card is the ten of wands. So wands are around the house. Ten is, “Someone comes for help on something you won\u0026rsquo;t do.” Ooh!\nClothing is so linked to like appearance and stuff that my first thoughts were like, territory I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to get into of like somebody being like, I need you to change that make it so this scarf makes my face look different because I hate my face. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, no, I love your face or whatever. Um, I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to go into that territory. So like, I was thinking this earlier when I gave like an example of a date, there\u0026rsquo;s like love spell type stuff, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know… that\u0026rsquo;s not super interesting to me.\nSo what is a limit that I have? Huh. What do you think, Garold?\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s a– my next thought is that it\u0026rsquo;s something to do with like somebody bringing me a garment from someone who died. And they\u0026rsquo;re not asking for like, a resurrection, but they\u0026rsquo;re– I think that they\u0026rsquo;re basically like… you know, “I\u0026rsquo;ve, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard that you can put parts of someone\u0026rsquo;s spirit into–” not quite have the person possess their old sweater or whatever, but like that it– there are rumors it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have a little part of them stick around and tethered using the emotional connection of this garment.\nAnd I think that I, I confirm that those rumours are true, that there is like part of a human spirit that, you know, even if you\u0026rsquo;re not fully resurrecting somebody, you can– you can call part of their spirit and you can bind it to this plane in that way so that they are around, still, in some form. And that I absolutely won\u0026rsquo;t do it because it\u0026rsquo;s cruel to both– to everyone involved. Like, we don\u0026rsquo;t know how that feels for the spirit, but probably not great, because these things tend to end poorly, you know? It often gets blamed on like, well, sorry, I, yep, I did pull it a little bit of your wife in that dress forever, um, and within a couple months, that dress did, uh, go on a killing spree, strangle a bunch of people and burn your house down. But that wasn\u0026rsquo;t your wife. Uh, that was, that was just, you know, life and death, energy, complicated, uh, demons, unrelated demon happened. That\u0026rsquo;s the story that gets told, but it– it seems to me, at least– to Duck and to a lot of people who also won\u0026rsquo;t do this and who consider people who do it kind of opportunist grifters– that it seems possible, maybe even likely, that that is– that destruction is being caused by the spirit of your loved one? ‘Cause it isn\u0026rsquo;t pleasant to just be trapped forever?\nAnd that ultimately it isn\u0026rsquo;t even fair to you because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide any more comfort than just having the garment would. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring them back. The only thing that it does is let you know that they\u0026rsquo;re still there in some form. But they aren\u0026rsquo;t. And so it– it interrupts your grieving process and your life and ties you to a version of your life and yourself that isn\u0026rsquo;t there anymore. The version that still had that person. But that isn\u0026rsquo;t the case. And it always ends poorly, because it isn\u0026rsquo;t fair to anybody involved, when it even works. And so I won\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nAnd you know, this person like begs and pleads and says it\u0026rsquo;s going to be different. And I\u0026rsquo;m just like, Nope, I don\u0026rsquo;t do it. But what I can do is like, sew your wedding ring into a little thing that you can wear around your neck that makes it so you\u0026rsquo;ll always remember her laugh or whatever. You know? Makes it harder to forget it. That\u0026rsquo;s something I can do, but I won\u0026rsquo;t do the other thing.\nAnd I think they reject that and they leave. And then a few weeks later, they come back and– and they take the ring thing. And they\u0026rsquo;re not happy with me about it still, but they do come back.\nRHIANNON: Ooh, five of wands. “Write a letter. Who is it for and what do you want to tell them?”\nOh, interesting. I guess as I\u0026rsquo;m getting to my third card, there\u0026rsquo;s a decision of whether to make this the last one for summer, and I think so.\nCan I– something I haven\u0026rsquo;t considered is whether she can stay in the same location for two seasons. I just want to check that. Okay, you can stay in the same location for more than one season. Yeah. All right.\nSo I think– this is going to be the last card for summer, but I\u0026rsquo;ll stay in the mountain village for fall as well.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s see. I think, here, Viv is writing a letter to a mentor of hers, you know, whoever trained her, right? Like, an older witch who she maybe apprenticed under, and she\u0026rsquo;s kind of asking for advice. She\u0026rsquo;s talking about how she hasn\u0026rsquo;t really felt like she\u0026rsquo;s had a place or found a place in any of the places she\u0026rsquo;s visited so far, but she\u0026rsquo;s not sure what it is she\u0026rsquo;s looking for, or what would make her feel like this is the place she wants to settle in, right?\nAnd I think that what her mentor writes back to her is that she should try staying in the same place for two seasons. And try to see what that\u0026rsquo;s like for her, if she has a bit longer and doesn\u0026rsquo;t just give up as soon as she doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel entirely at home somewhere.\nAGATHA: This is a five of spades. “You perform a ritual. What is the purpose of it?”\nI think this is a communication ritual. This is one where you send tidings, either good or bad, to someone further away. It\u0026rsquo;s faster than mail, but you also can\u0026rsquo;t communicate any words basically. It\u0026rsquo;s just like a feeling that you\u0026rsquo;re sending. So she is performing a ritual to send good tidings, uh, to her– to her family, to let them know that she is fine and that things are generally going well.\nAnd I think that marks the end of the season. And it\u0026rsquo;s been nice. Again, the weather is something that she\u0026rsquo;s used to and she\u0026rsquo;s starting to get comfortable within the village. She\u0026rsquo;s understanding how to handle the dynamics between her and the rest of the villagers.\nBut I think she\u0026rsquo;s also growing a bit restless. She\u0026rsquo;s like, okay, I think I know how to handle my job now. And she wants to go somewhere where the climate feels very different. So I think she is going to bid this village goodbye. And they are sad to see her go, I think. They like her. She\u0026rsquo;s good at what she does, and there is that unconscious sort of attitude that she has of not quite thinking of the villagers as her equal– maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because she comes from a city, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because she comes from a higher class in her background– but they kind of expect that. That\u0026rsquo;s not unusual for an assigned witch. So I think they generally wish that she would stay.\nAnd I think especially Peony is actually kind of upset about it because they\u0026rsquo;ve grown closer and she thought that there was something between her and Ginkgo. And I feel like it became this very awkward conversation where, when Ginkgo reiterates that yes, she will be going, then Peony leaves and is clearly upset about it.\nI think that Ginkgo will miss this village, actually. And she won\u0026rsquo;t realize this until she has moved away. How much she actually likes this village and how much she will miss it. She\u0026rsquo;s trying not to regret the way that things ended with Peony. And she\u0026rsquo;s trying to look forward and think about what she wants out of her assignment.\nSATAH: [Card flipping sounds] Card number three is the Empress. “Choose a villager you would like to connect with and invite them over. How do you prepare? What do you discuss? After the visit, how do you feel about the connection?” Ooh.\nVillager I\u0026rsquo;d like to connect with. I\u0026rsquo;d love for this to be something a little romantic! I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun. I think it\u0026rsquo;s– I like the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s… somebody who was on the path that day– maybe the first person– like the day that I arrived in town. It was like– it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the first person who popped out. It was somebody who popped out and like pulled everyone else off of me a little bit, you know? Like, came out and was like, “Alright, alright, I think we should probably let them get settled, right? We have a long time to ask them a bunch of questions. It\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;re here for.” And gave me like a big smile and pulled me into the forest with them to separate me from the, like, well-meaning but very overbearing other villagers, and brought me to the cave. And we\u0026rsquo;ve seen each other on and off in the past few months, you know? We see each other around.\nI want them to have a similarly like– something crafty about them. I think they\u0026rsquo;re like a– like a– jewelry maker or a– yeah. They like do rock tumbling and like make jewelry. And so we\u0026rsquo;ve seen each other at markets and stuff and traded. And I think that when we first– I went to like invite them to talk about the craft or something or like, I was like, “Hey, you should come over and show me how to do this one specific thing!”\nAnd they like, gave me a look and smiled and they\u0026rsquo;re like, “I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to show you that, but is that why you want me to come over?”\nAnd Duck is like, you know, flushes and is like, “Okay, that might have been a pretense. Um. I do want to learn that thing though, but maybe we can do that another time. Would you like to come over– would you like t– would you like to come over for dinner with me? To have dinner with me?”\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Yes.” With that said, we do end up talking about that stuff.\nBut I think, yeah, preparing, I like, you know, make a big lovely dinner. And I think I also pull out some of my collection of like buttons and, and, and baubles and beads and stuff to talk about like different places where I picked them up and like, because I know that they\u0026rsquo;re interested in– in like the construction of these things. And so I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Oh, here\u0026rsquo;s techniques that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in other places.”\nAnd yeah, we talk about that stuff. We talk about working with our hands… [Suggestively] eyebrows… and making things and the unique, like fascinating joy that is having your art be something that other people use as self-expression? Like, especially for them making jewelry, like– the fact that they make things that people come to identify with so strongly, like, “I created this as an extension of myself and someone else picks it up and it comes to like, define them in some way or, or be a huge part of their personal style and definition of self.” And what a like deep connection that is and how like– from my end, you know, Duck starts talking about how like, yeah, the the amount of like, just emotion magic and feeling that gets that gets stored in clothing and accessories and things that people wear and things that people use to express themselves… is incredible. And that being able to like, be part of the creation of that is like, unbelievable, and such an honour.\nWe talk about that. And we talk about where they\u0026rsquo;re from, which is like a colder climate. We talk about how they got here. A little bit how I got here, but a little bit less, because I think that story already kind of went around the village, you know? People wanted to know my backstory, and then they told everybody. People talk in this town. And so they do ask, you know– they want to make sure that they got it right, and that they\u0026rsquo;re not just believing what\u0026rsquo;s been told about me, which I appreciate because as we established earlier… that\u0026rsquo;s occasionally a problem I\u0026rsquo;ve run into.\nBut mostly, I want to hear about them and how they got here to where we both are right now. And we eat dinner, and we go on a walk through the forest. And I point to a bunch of mundane rocks and ask them if it\u0026rsquo;s a gem. And they laugh every time. And then there\u0026rsquo;s one time where they start to laugh and then they go, “Wait a second,” and they pick it up. And it is. And they show me how they can tell– like, the little markers of the colour shining through. And they, they– their face lights up and they start talking about the potential of it and what it can become, what it already is, how– how they can just help make it express itself more fully. And they put the rock in my hand, and I look at it and I look up at them and I smile. And we kiss in that forest. And then… yeah. We spend the night together. And they head home in the morning with that rock. And they say that I should come over and they\u0026rsquo;ll show me how they turn something like that into a wearable piece of jewelry.\nAnd I feel good about it. That\u0026rsquo;s how I feel. I feel good about it.\n[Laughing]\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s summer.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

The poll for which game I\u0026rsquo;ll be playing on the monthly livestream for patrons will be wrapping up in just a few days.\nAs we head into Autumn in the game, only one of our witches is moving on from their current locale, so let\u0026rsquo;s join Agatha as she develops the next town Ginkgo will be working at, then let\u0026rsquo;s bring Viv and Duck right back in for the rest of the fall.\n[Laughing at having specified that] As if there\u0026rsquo;s any other way that we could go. No. This is… I\u0026rsquo;m pivoting. This is just Agatha\u0026rsquo;s show now. I haven\u0026rsquo;t told her. I hope she\u0026rsquo;s excited.\nTHE GAME RHIANNON: Okay. So.\nAGATHA: So. Autumn.\nSATAH: Time for Autumn.\nRHIANNON: Now we\u0026rsquo;re gonna move into Autumn.\nSATAH: It is super rainy here today, and I think some of the leaves are starting to change. It feels too early. But weather has been strange this summer. The past couple weeks there will randomly be a day where the night specifically does feel a little autumnal. And all the seasonal drinks are rolling out– I have pumpkin spice oat milk creamer in my fridge right now. [Chuckles] And this is Duck\u0026rsquo;s favorite season, so let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nAGATHA: [Die clattering] Okay. In terms of location, this time I rolled a 3, which is Grasslands. Ooh, that\u0026rsquo;s very exciting.\nSATAH: One thing I should note is that I do think that Duck stays. I\u0026rsquo;m just actually gonna double check– “As each season draws to an end, contemplate if it\u0026rsquo;s time to move on, if you wish to stay, or if you\u0026rsquo;re gonna settle in.” Okay. So I don\u0026rsquo;t know about settling in yet, but I am… Duck is gonna stay through Autumn at the very least.\nAGATHA: “What is Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s new house like?” I think… hmmm. If it\u0026rsquo;s Grasslands– people usually migrate more on Grasslands just by the nature of living in an environment like that. So I think that Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s new house within this new village is probably a tent.\n“Is it in the village on the outskirts or a long walk away?” I think, yeah, if it\u0026rsquo;s tented and they tend to move around a lot, that means that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want people to be really spread out. Unlike before, where Ginkgo was kind of more on the outskirts, this tent is located centrally in the village and there is no garden this time. It\u0026rsquo;s not really as feasible.\n“What is something unique about Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s tent specifically?” I think it does have… I mean, Ginkgo brings the herbs and so on that she needs. And so she would hang them from the edge of the tent and so it always smells different from the rest of the tents.\nAnd I think there is also a very specific pattern that\u0026rsquo;s painted onto the outside of the tent that designates it as the village witch\u0026rsquo;s tent. I think other tents probably– like a lot of them have certain designs and stuff, but the village witch\u0026rsquo;s design is unique and consistent. So amongst the Grasslands, the village witch\u0026rsquo;s tent generally has the same pattern on the outside. Also because village witches often are not permanent, so this is more of a way for the villagers to identify it than necessarily a pattern of the village witch\u0026rsquo;s choosing.\n“Is the tent haunted or is there an animal friend that comes to visit?” It is… oh yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s say that it is haunted. I think it is haunted by the spirit of a previous village witch. And on the first night that Ginkgo shows up, she is paid a visit by the previous village witch. And no one in the village has told her about the presence of this ghost witch, so Ginkgo was definitely in for a surprise. And I think Ginkgo is a little bit offended by this other witch… who refuses to leave, in Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s opinion. And whatever conversation they had, it was not, um– didn\u0026rsquo;t leave Ginkgo feeling very comfortable about the situation.\nAnd her initial impression of the village is that they… well, at first they seemed… I think they feel less welcoming than the previous Swampland village, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is actually true. I think it\u0026rsquo;s just that Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s impression of the last village has improved so much through the two seasons that she\u0026rsquo;s been with them that this new village just kind of like closed off-ness towards strangers feels more jarring for Ginkgo. And so she has the impression that they are not friendly, and that impression has only deepened after she encounters the ghost.\nThe first person that Ginkgo meets was the village leader, and he is I think a bit older than Ginkgo, but not by a lot. So Ginkgo was surprised by how young he was. She didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that he was the village leader at first, because when Ginkgo arrived at the last village she was met by Peony. And Peony was young, but was also the child of the village elder. And very clearly the village elder is the leader of the village. But here in this village, this young man– I should give him a name.\nUm… huh. I need to come up with a grass name. Is it– is it silly to call him Bluegrass? I think so. Okay, I did some brief research on Chinese medicine herbs that are also grass, and I came up with Ephedra. Well, technically it\u0026rsquo;s Chinese ephedra, which is now banned in Canada because it\u0026rsquo;s often used by athletes as a performance enhancement drug. But anyway, this young leader of this grassland tribe is going to be called Ephedra.\nSo yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s the person that greets Ginkgo, and he has that kind of brusque manner that I assume a very busy and probably overburdened young leader of any tribe could have. But the villagers looked at him with a surprising amount of respect considering his age. And Ginkgo doesn\u0026rsquo;t know why he is the leader, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure that she will find out.\nSATAH: “The air turns crisp and there\u0026rsquo;s a shift in the world around you as life prepares for the changes on the way.”\nRHIANNON: “Leaves drift through the air and crops grow ready for harvest.”\nAGATHA: “How do you feel about the shifting seasons?”\nSATAH: As kind of established, like, excited! Duck likes fall, um– because it brings that, like, sense of preparation and getting ready and, you know, shifting from something that was a little bit easier to something that\u0026rsquo;s more difficult and trying to do your best to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re ready for it when it comes. So they\u0026rsquo;re excited.\nRHIANNON: I think that Viv… even though she does take the advice of just trying to stay somewhere a little bit longer before giving up, she\u0026rsquo;s nervous. This is the longest that she\u0026rsquo;s been in one place for a little while, and she maybe starts to feel the pressure of, oh, I better find a way to make things work here soon, or I\u0026rsquo;m just wasting my time and maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll never find somewhere, right?\nAGATHA: Ginkgo is not used to colder weather. That\u0026rsquo;s not a thing for her. She understands intellectually what being cold means, but she has not experienced it before. So I think it is very jarring and uncomfortable. And her skin has never been this dry before. As the grasses turned more golden in autumn, they\u0026rsquo;re starting to get drier and she– it is so cold and she does not understand how it can be so cold and so windy. And, um… yeah! She doesn\u0026rsquo;t love it. She thought that it would feel a certain way and she\u0026rsquo;s a bit nervous now that she\u0026rsquo;s actually experiencing autumn for the first time.\nSATAH: “How do you enjoy the changes of autumn?” Yeah, again, this is Duck\u0026rsquo;s favorite season. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll note that I discussed when Duck was moving to the forest, like– this is similar in a lot of ways to where they\u0026rsquo;re from, but there are differences. I imagine that– there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of, like– that is especially hitting now, you know, going into their favourite season– and so there\u0026rsquo;s like the parts that are familiar are extra comforting and the parts that are novel are extra alienating or strange? Um, probably sometimes exciting.\nI\u0026rsquo;m imagining this being a quite gentle change. Like the idea that the sort of wooded area where Duck is from is kind of like… the leaves change and then there\u0026rsquo;s one big storm and all of the trees are bare. It\u0026rsquo;s like something that can really happen very quickly, like that slow buildup and then shift. And here I\u0026rsquo;m just picturing it a little bit more slow. Everything\u0026rsquo;s so dense, like a big storm can come through and there are trees it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to this time, you know? So they\u0026rsquo;re enjoying it and I think that, you know, after they settle in a bit and get used to it, I think that they realize that they really like being able to linger in that a little bit more. You know, it gives them more time to do all that like preparatory work that they really enjoy. So they are– they\u0026rsquo;re thrilled. They\u0026rsquo;re having a great time.\nRHIANNON: Let\u0026rsquo;s see, “how do you enjoy the changes of autumn?” I think she likes the cooler weather. I think that, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s probably pretty chilly up at high elevation in autumn, to the point where maybe you start getting like a little bit of snow. And you know, she\u0026rsquo;s looking forward to winter, which, you know, again, is her favourite season.\nSATAH: “And how do you set up your altar?” Yeah, so I mean, at this point, Duck has been out as a workin’ witch in the world for six months. So I imagine they\u0026rsquo;ve upgraded their setup a little bit. Oh, especially because they\u0026rsquo;re living with two very advanced magic users.\nSo I imagine it\u0026rsquo;s like the full moon– the first full moon of fall or whatever. And the other two are like, “Alright,” cracking knuckles, like, “time to time to shift some materials. What do you need? What do you have?”\nAnd Duck kind of like smiles and is like, “Well,” and gestures to their not super involved altar.\nAnd their two roommates are like, “Oookay, so let\u0026rsquo;s do a little montage.” Not quite a like outfit trying on montage, but they\u0026rsquo;re like, you know, going through all of their materials and giving Duck upgraded versions of some of the stuff that they have. And especially stuff, I think that they\u0026rsquo;re like, “You know, if you\u0026rsquo;re going to be doing work here, you really should have a mortar and pestle that is made out of local materials in order to better connect your magic to this specific physical location” and whatever, you know. So I think a little bit of Duck has already done a little bit of that, you know, gradually over the time that they\u0026rsquo;ve been here. But this opportunity for a refresh allows their roommates to give them a makeover montage, but just of the altar.\nAnd I think one thing specifically is that I\u0026rsquo;m going to add, you know, the rock that they found on that date near the end of spring. I think like their paramour, who I should name, tumbled the rock and turned it into a beautiful little gem. And they have it on their altar as sort of, you know, a foci, something to concentrate on just something that is full of their own feelings and potential in a way that is, like, very powerful for them right now.\nRHIANNON: “How do you set up your altar?” I think here, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother with that, right? She doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother with the sort of appearance of having that kind of thing set up. But in place of setting that up, I think she starts to actually fully unpack all of her belongings, which half of them have been sitting in, you know, the bag that she brought them. And since she moved in at the beginning of summer, she starts to actually put them where they would belong around the house.\nAGATHA: She does set up her altar. It\u0026rsquo;s very different now that she\u0026rsquo;s in a tent as opposed to a shack, which she\u0026rsquo;s more used to. So yeah, she sets it up in the corner of the tent and does the usual things as best as she could.\nShe does now need to be more aware of the amount of space she actually has, since– she can do things outside, and she does, but she has been told by the other villagers when they find out that she came from a place that does not have winter, uh, they tell her that she\u0026rsquo;ll need to have certain things set up inside as well when it gets colder because she can\u0026rsquo;t really take the outside space as an extension of her home the same way that she did in a place that is just very warm all the time.\nSo yeah, she\u0026rsquo;s really trying to get used to a lot of things. The villagers will tell her things if she asks them, but otherwise they will not.\nSATAH: And with that, we\u0026rsquo;re going to pull three cards. [Three cards being dealt]\nAGATHA: Alright, time to draw the first card. Okay, this is a seven of spades. So this again is around the home. “A child visits you to tell you about an exciting discovery.” Ah yes, the kids.\nGinkgo has learned from her time in the Swampland village that kids are naturally curious and sometimes that curiosity can turn into animosity and she does not want that. So what she does is, um– she does– mm. She tries to talk to the kids and I think what she offers them are… it\u0026rsquo;s not candy, but it\u0026rsquo;s a kind of plant, like dried herb that she took from the Swampland village that is a little bit sweet. Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not a dried plant. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a dried fruit, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s like sweet-ish. And the kids have never had that before, the kids here in this grassland village, so it\u0026rsquo;s very exciting to them. They all love sweets and so they start gathering around her more.\nAnd, um, one day one of the kids goes to tell her about– I think the kid tells her to actually crouch down and put her ear to the ground. And he\u0026rsquo;s very proud of himself as he said that. And Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s like, I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why you are doing this. But because she wants to make friends with the kids and she wants to also, through the kids, get closer to the other villagers, she does it.\nAnd then when she places her ear on the ground, at first she doesn\u0026rsquo;t really know what\u0026rsquo;s happening. What she feels is the grass kind of uncomfortably poking at her face. But then the kid says, “Listen,” and she listens and she starts to hear this rumbling just rolling through the ground. And she looks up at the kid, startled. And the kid is so pleased with her reaction– that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what he wanted. And so he puts his hands on his hips and says, “That\u0026rsquo;s the sound of migrating deer.” And Ginkgo is surprised. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know that that\u0026rsquo;s a thing that happens.\nAnd so yeah, the kids tell her that this is a thing that happens, that these deer migrate in groups. And when they do, it often makes for good hunting. And that\u0026rsquo;s what the village is going to do. And Ephedra is going to lead the villagers to go and they\u0026rsquo;re going to do a multi-day hunt and we\u0026rsquo;re going to be moving soon.\nAnd Ginkgo is hearing about this for the first time. And then almost immediately after the kid tells her this, Ephedra comes up to her, to Ginkgo, and tells her, “We\u0026rsquo;re moving.” And actually, yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t think he explains why. He just says that. And then Ginkgo looks at him expecting him to expand on this, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t. And so she\u0026rsquo;s like, okay then, fine. And that is an exciting discovery.\nRHIANNON: Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s draw the first card for Autumn, which is the Knight of Cups. “You need help from someone else. What do you need and who do you go to?” That\u0026rsquo;s an interesting one here to get right at the beginning of the season where she\u0026rsquo;s trying to really make an effort to just sit here and not give up on things. So let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nI think that, you know, probably people have been coming to her for like minor healing things a lot, right? So not a lot, but some. So she knows people around town generally, but hasn\u0026rsquo;t really gone to them very much.\nBut I think maybe there\u0026rsquo;s like a wall by the cottage, right? Like a wall for the terrace that the garden was sitting on that\u0026rsquo;s starting to come a little bit undone. And this isn\u0026rsquo;t really a thing she has much expertise with repairing, especially because it\u0026rsquo;s like kind of a local architectural specialty. And so she needs to go and find like a mason down in the village or something, right? For just help dealing with this wall.\nI think what happens when she does this is that, you know, people had been kind of, uh– had sensed that she was a little bit standoffish, right? Or that she was, like, not super eager to socialize up until now. And they\u0026rsquo;d kept their distance on purpose. But once she actually goes and asks somebody for help and needs somebody to be at her house for like a whole day to help her with this thing, it\u0026rsquo;s like the dam breaks. And you know, maybe the mason invites a friend or a family member to come up and help with them. And you know, one after another, she ends up with like half the village kind of up there with her, helping her, like, make sure that everything is sorted out.\nAnd it ends up being this kind of situation of, you know, she needs one person\u0026rsquo;s help, that person needs someone else\u0026rsquo;s help. Maybe while people are up there, someone gets hurt in a minor way, needs a little help from her. And she\u0026rsquo;s able to kind of see a little bit more how this village fits together and how she can fit into it by just watching people work and figuring out where she can fit into that.\nSo by needing help with this wall, she ends up feeling a little bit less isolated by the time the work is done at the end of the- at the end of the day.\nSATAH: Our first card is the devil. [Laughing] The tarot cards I\u0026rsquo;m using are a deck of cat paintings. And I don\u0026rsquo;t remember taking notice of this one before. But it is two cats with bunny ears, one of whom has very impressive fangs that it\u0026rsquo;s showing. It\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s really something. Okay.\n“You wake from a nightmare and a sense of foreboding hangs over you for the day. What troubles you?” Ooh.\nA couple things pop up immediately. One is having it be connected to the town in the desert, the place that I lived in the spring. Another is having it be connected to some high stakes thing that the two roommates are dealing with– you know, the idea that they often have shared visions that I am now close enough to them and our– our lives and powers are now interlinked enough that I occasionally get those shared visions as well, despite not particularly wanting them.\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s a thread from– from the desert town that I think just popped up for me to pull at. It\u0026rsquo;s a nightmare about Honey, the witch that was there before me in the desert, who was enabling a bunch of, like, political corruption and that kind of thing. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s a– it\u0026rsquo;s a nightmare that the– the overwhelming like, emotional sense of it is the idea that I have been meddling in things above my pay grade? Like, just– just getting involved in situations that ultimately I have no right to be involved in.\nAnd I think it– it– it– it has a feeling of that being true across all areas of my life. Like, it is– it\u0026rsquo;s like visions of that desert town crumbling, of that weird stilted art house that I lived in shattering under the heat of the sun and the refracting light from it as it falls like setting fires to like desert vegetation, and the people that I helped and got to know hurting and being hungry.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s one of those moments that feels horrific in the dream. And then you wake up and realize how absurd it is, where like, my two roommates are fighting some eldritch god and then they like trip over a shoe that I left in the middle of the living room. And it becomes like a little roommate squabble of like, “You can\u0026rsquo;t leave your shoes around,” but with the consequences of losing this fight against this eldritch being.\nAnd– and it– and it– and it– ties into like this new budding romance I have, too– like the idea that we\u0026rsquo;re– we\u0026rsquo;re walking in this- in the forest. And they\u0026rsquo;re telling me things about their life and their past and needling me with questions that I can\u0026rsquo;t answer, and- and- and transforming into a person who\u0026rsquo;s like, “Well, why can\u0026rsquo;t you help me? Why can\u0026rsquo;t you fix all of these things that happened before I knew you?” and that kind of thing, you know? And and and it just like– has this feeling of everything in my life being something that I, specifically, am unequipped to handle, and that I make worse by trying– by touching it.\nAnd it lingers. You know, I wake up and I\u0026rsquo;m able to shake off a couple things like, you know, I wake up and I have a moment of anxiety about leaving my shoes in the middle of the living room. And then I realize I never do that. That isn\u0026rsquo;t even one of my annoying roommate habits. And I\u0026rsquo;m able to sort through some of those things.\nBut it– but it still, the emotional parts of it, the feeling of it lingers. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s an extra piece of worry, which is wondering, like, because there was so much presence from Honey, the vague wonder if this is– was caused by her, if she\u0026rsquo;s like sending me terrible visions. Like, was this a regular nightmare? Or was this some sort of magical interference from somebody who is very mad at me for getting in the way of some of her schemes? And I think we\u0026rsquo;ll– we\u0026rsquo;ll find out whether that\u0026rsquo;s true or not as we sort of continue with the story. Let\u0026rsquo;s pull the next card.\nRHIANNON: This card is the Nine of Wands. “You spend some time strengthening your abilities. What are your strengths? What areas do you want to improve?”\nI think what this is, is actually another social thing for her– is that she realises that her skill set with both the healing thing and the, like, gardening and tending to plants thing is both like– it\u0026rsquo;s pretty general, right? It\u0026rsquo;s not very localised. And there\u0026rsquo;s some sort of local knowledge as far as like, the growing cycle around here and what kind of injuries people tend to have when they\u0026rsquo;re working around here that she\u0026rsquo;s not very specialised into. And so I think she ends up going down into the village again.\nAnd just, I\u0026rsquo;m almost imagining a little montage of her watching people working, like harvesting crops and like taking notes, and sometimes getting in there and working with them. But like, you know, as people are taking breaks, as she\u0026rsquo;s sitting over by the side of another one of these terrace gardens, she\u0026rsquo;s like talking to whoever is taking a break at the moment, like asking them what it\u0026rsquo;s like to work with these particular plants, what kind of dangers there are on the job and stuff. And just conducting this series of little interviews to sort of not strengthen her abilities so much as specialize for like this area and to know what to expect when things do, if things do start getting a little more difficult for people around here.\nYou know, she is good at all of this, but she just wants to have kind of a more lived in knowledge of it, I guess. And so it\u0026rsquo;s this long montage of her like working with people, watching them work, interviewing them while they\u0026rsquo;re taking a break from working, noticing like, oh, you know, this part of this person\u0026rsquo;s workflow looks like it could get them hurt on a bad day or something like that, right? And so she\u0026rsquo;s spending a lot more time down in the village instead of up overlooking it in her own house.\nAnd maybe we get an image of her sort of getting home at night, tired, like winding things down and going over the notes and rearranging her supplies for like, “Okay, so I want this, this, this kind of herb around. These are the tools that I actually need to have on hand and these other ones can maybe be in a box somewhere,” that kind of thing.\nSATAH: The Queen of Swords. So swords are around the house and queen is, “Memory and nostalgia wrap around you and you find yourself lost in the past. What is something you miss?”\nThis is very timely, you know, this being my favourite season and everything. And I think that it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s probably nearly universal to… smell– the first time the air smells like autumn, and it is like this brief time travel to every autumn you\u0026rsquo;ve ever lived. I think this is often– often true. And certainly true for Duck. So this is, this is very timely.\nI think– so, having established that the place where Duck is from, they all lived sort of high up in the trees, I think that\u0026rsquo;s part of it. I think that this is an unexpected moment where like Duck is just doing like tasks around town, helping out. And there\u0026rsquo;s like a branch that\u0026rsquo;s threatening to fall off of a tree and they don\u0026rsquo;t want it to fall unexpectedly and hurt somebody.\nAnd so they\u0026rsquo;re like, hey, we need to go up there and get it, but it might not be totally ready to come off, you know, we just need to go up and cut it. And Duck is like, great, I\u0026rsquo;ll go up and magic it. Use my magic knife.\n[Sirens] My goodness, those are loud. Okay.\nUm, yeah. So Duck is, is sent up to sort of safely remove this branch before it can fall the rest of the way and hurt somebody unexpectedly.\nAnd while they\u0026rsquo;re up there, you know, they\u0026rsquo;re wrapping a piece of thread around the broken part of the branch where it\u0026rsquo;s still semi-attached, but just not securely enough. They\u0026rsquo;re wrapping some thread around it and doing their little spell to break it safely the rest of the way.\nAnd while they\u0026rsquo;re waiting– you know, the charm has to set for a couple of minutes before it takes effect– and they\u0026rsquo;re just up high in this tree amongst all the colorful leaves and that autumn air. And they\u0026rsquo;re looking out over the horizon and it just like hits them how much this is a view from home.\nAnd I think the thing they miss in a way that is really unexpected for them, something that they haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about in this entire journey… they suddenly miss being around people who already have the context of their life? Like, they\u0026rsquo;re up in this tree and they get hit with this wave of memory, and they want to share it, because it\u0026rsquo;s pleasant. It\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s a nice feeling to feel connected to those past moments again. And they want to share it.\nAnd then they remember, or it pops up in their brain, like, “Oh, I\u0026rsquo;d have to explain to people, ‘You know, where I\u0026rsquo;m from, we live up in the trees…’” and, and they want to say, “Oh, it reminded me of this one specific day. You remember that day during that one festival when this happened?” And they realized that there isn\u0026rsquo;t anybody near them who already knows that. They can\u0026rsquo;t just say, “Remember that festival?” They have to say, “Oh, yeah, there was this festival that always came through. It came through every year at this specific time.” And “Oh, it was important because you know, this happened there and this, these people would always come with me and,” and like, they would have to, in order to share this, like, feeling, they would have to explain and give so much context for the feeling.\nAnd that isn\u0026rsquo;t… terrible, you know. That\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s nice to, to be able to share more parts of yourself with people, but there is something about already having done that and not having to do it.\nAnd so for the first time in a long time, or, or at least the first time consciously, they are very aware of the fact that everyone they know, even the people they really like, is new, and, and needs to be walked through anything they want to share. That they don\u0026rsquo;t have anybody yet here who knows enough about them. And that they\u0026rsquo;ll never have anybody here who was there for all of it, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t even need to be told because they remember it too.\nAnd that just hits. It just hits really hard and they\u0026rsquo;re surprised by it. And then, you know, they take the, they take the tree branch down and they drop onto the ground and their first instinct is to go and find their paramour and ask, like, “Did any fairs ever come through your town where you were growing up? Was there ever like a seasonal fair that came through?” and they swap stories and they talk a little bit. And then eventually Duck is led to share like the feeling that they had. And I think that– let\u0026rsquo;s name, let\u0026rsquo;s name the person who they\u0026rsquo;re, they\u0026rsquo;re seeing. The person that they\u0026rsquo;re dating? Or whatever?\nThe name they go by is Connie, which of course is short for the regular human name Economic Basis. Connie.\nSo Duck goes to Connie and Connie listens and shares and it\u0026rsquo;s really, it\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful moment between the two of them. But then Connie also says, “Hey, you should write home! You know, I know that you share updates sometimes, and especially– you know, people will write to you and you\u0026rsquo;ll answer all of their questions, but… you can just write home. You can write down that memory you had and what it meant to you. And you can send that to somebody you grew up with and it isn\u0026rsquo;t immediate, but they\u0026rsquo;ll get it and they will know and they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to share it with you. And it– and it\u0026rsquo;s slow, but you\u0026rsquo;re not cut off from that. You can still do it.”\nAnd Duck sort of like nods slowly and is like, “That\u0026rsquo;s… that\u0026rsquo;s a really good idea.”\nAnd Connie is like, “You know, actually I should, I should write a letter to my best friend. Let\u0026rsquo;s go grab a tea and write some letters together.”\nAnd they do.\nAGATHA: Now for the Major Arcana. Okay. This time I rolled a 16, which will technically be 17, but I already rolled this the first season in spring. It was the star and it was to perform a ritual for personal healing. So I don\u0026rsquo;t want to repeat it. I will instead just take the number as is, which is 16 and that it corresponds to the tower.\n“Something happens to challenge one of your beliefs or preconceptions, whether about yourself, other people or the world at large. What new realization have you reached and how does it affect you?”\nI think this is during the move actually. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s the– well, it\u0026rsquo;s the move to a new place, and then the hunt. So during this move, um, Ginkgo has to do it herself and she does not know how to do it. Um, so she has to– she struggles with it for a bit because of her pride. Um, and then eventually, she– I think one of the kids, the same kid that told her about the, the upcoming hunt rolls around and she asks the kid if her– I mean, sorry, if his family is done getting ready to go and he says, “Well, yeah, almost.” So then she asks if she could ask his family to help her because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do.\nAnd the kid is like, “Wow, you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do anything! Well, all right, I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll help you.” That kind of thing.\nSo yeah, she kind of swallows her pride and asks for help and the, the family, they, they do help her and it\u0026rsquo;s kind of awkward the whole way through, um, and she offers them a talisman, basically, at the end of helping her pack– roll up her tent and pack up. Uh, and they accept. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of still like an awkward transactional moment, but, well, things don\u0026rsquo;t always progress as smoothly as– as you want.\nSo they leave and then I think it\u0026rsquo;s like, pitching the tent at a new location and there\u0026rsquo;s like a bustle of activity all around Ginkgo and she struggles with her tent and then also listens to what everyone else is saying.\nAnd then the hunt begins and a lot of people leave. Just basically the older people, the elders, and then the children stay behind. And it goes on for a bit.\nNone of this is what, um, actually, well– I think Ginkgo does reflect a little bit like, “Hmm. Like I really am not good at many things, which is different from how I– I saw myself before.”\nBut as she\u0026rsquo;s thinking about this, there was like another thundering of hooves. And um, I think what happens is that the hunt is successful, but then, um, I think there are other, um– there\u0026rsquo;s like another predator group, maybe like a group of wolves or something that also, um, start to come towards, uh, the herd of deer. And so the deer freak out and they start scattering in different directions. So they\u0026rsquo;re not quite under the control of, uh, the hunters anymore, uh, because there, there\u0026rsquo;s wolves coming from another direction. So they basically stampede towards the village and it\u0026rsquo;s very, very dangerous, um, obviously. Just like, a stampede of animals in general.\nEveryone is kind of freaking out, um, and Ginkgo does not know what to do. She has not had to deal with this situation before. And also her magic is not really this kind of magic. It\u0026rsquo;s slower, it\u0026rsquo;s support, that kind of thing. And so, uh, she is going with the elders and the kids, like– to– as there\u0026rsquo;s just, like, the sound of the hooves are just echoing all around her. Uh, they\u0026rsquo;re, they\u0026rsquo;re all trying to run away, and then like, there\u0026rsquo;s just that moment when a deer runs through– runs through the village, um, and then another and then another, and then they kind of like stampede through, um, the tents and the things that have been laid out.\nAnd then, like, there\u0026rsquo;s a moment where Ginkgo is almost going to get hit, uh, by one of these deer. I mean, will it– would it have happened? Unsure, because they– they can still see and they do avoid obstacles, but that– to Ginkgo– felt like she was going to get hit by the deer. And then she gets scooped up by Ephedra. And then like, they just like ride for a while, um, until all of the deer pass through, and like all of the kids and the elders, um, are gathered back. And then, you know, everyone is checked on all that stuff.\nBut like, this was a terrifying day for Ginkgo. And I think this is when she really understands that she is so small in the face of danger and that she really cannot do things by herself, that she needs to rely on other people.\nAnd after, you know, everyone has settled down, she does go and thank Ephedra. And Ephedra has this very like dismissive kind of brusque reply, like, “Yes, you, you should be more careful next time,” or something like that.\nActually, no, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t do that. Um, what Ephedra says is, “It was my duty,” and Ginkgo says, “Yes, but I am still thankful and I would like to do something for the village to– to help settle everyone\u0026rsquo;s spirits and to express my thanks.”\nRHIANNON: And let\u0026rsquo;s see, there is a third card for Autumn. Oh, the Empress. This– is this the first? Yeah, this is my first major arcana. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. Empress is, “Choose a villager you would like to connect with and invite them over. How do you prepare? What do you discuss? After the visit, how do you feel about the connection?” Oh, let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nI think maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the baker again– that, that first person she really talked to in the village. I think she invites the baker over. She\u0026rsquo;s almost– Viv is almost testing herself here, right? Where she– she like wants to feel like she\u0026rsquo;s understood everything she\u0026rsquo;s been like taking notes on and figuring out about like how to live here and help people.\nI\u0026rsquo;m realizing now that she\u0026rsquo;s kind of a designed to study routine and an exam for herself on how to have neighbours and talk to people. [Laughing] Um, so I guess that\u0026rsquo;s kind of what she\u0026rsquo;s done. And she\u0026rsquo;s viewing, you know, this dinner, um– maybe she\u0026rsquo;s making like that particular soup that the baker explained to her when she first moved in as, you know, she\u0026rsquo;s making it to, you know, try and show that she like understands how to do that. And she wants to go over her notes with the baker and see that like she has the right ideas about this place.\nAnd, um. I think the baker thinks it\u0026rsquo;s really funny. Like she comes over and she sees Viv being like very, very serious about this and like having her notebook out as she\u0026rsquo;s cooking. And she probably does get the food basically right? Like it\u0026rsquo;s good, but as she, as she wants to start like reviewing her notes with the baker– oh, I should come up with a name for the baker. Huh. Let’s just call her Sophia for now.\nYeah, Sophia comes over and is immediately like trying not to laugh at how serious Viv is being about all of this, right? And then once they actually start getting into the notes, the first thing she\u0026rsquo;s saying is like, “Well, first of all, this soup is kind of supposed to be a breakfast. This isn’t the time of day for it. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s good, but it\u0026rsquo;s, you know,” and it\u0026rsquo;s that kind of thing in general where she\u0026rsquo;s like gently making fun of how seriously Viv takes this, but also knowledgeable enough that like Viv doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel that embarrassed about the whole situation, you know.\nAnd I think at the end of it, it\u0026rsquo;s like– the way that Viv is feeling about the whole thing is like kind of relief almost. Like she feels a little dumb for having like, for realizing as she\u0026rsquo;s doing this that she\u0026rsquo;s basically designed this into a test for herself instead of just a dinner with a person from the village. But she\u0026rsquo;s a little bit relieved that she kind of did get a good grade in living here. Uh [Laughing]. You know, normal thing to want, possible to achieve, et cetera. And she likes talking to the baker. She\u0026rsquo;s happy about this.\nAGATHA: This one is a three of diamonds. Diamond is around the village. Ah, perfect. “Someone tells you their house is being haunted and asks you to help.”\nSo yeah, um. Ginkgo does kind of like a village wide– well, actually, no, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a village wide thing. She goes individually to each villager and offers to kind of do a ritual of peace and then also offer just maybe tinctures for people to kind of settle their emotions, because obviously they had a very stressful time.\nAnd also, she would have done her rounds of– to check on anyone with injuries. I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone was really injured because while it was a harrowing experience, the– I think the elders, even though they\u0026rsquo;re slow, they are good at dealing with these situations. So they were able to get the kids out of the way fast enough. And also the hunters were able to get back in time to kind of help and save any of the people like Ginkgo who didn\u0026rsquo;t know which way to run to get out of the way.\nSo yeah, Ginkgo goes around and then, um… I think this is– it\u0026rsquo;s actually Ephedra who tells Ginkgo that he is haunted. And when Ginkgo asks who is the one haunting, Ephedra pauses and then says that it\u0026rsquo;s his mother who was the last leader of this village before she passed away.\nSo Ginkgo kind of asks like, “I am also haunted by my predecessor. Is this a common thing that happens?”\nAnd then Ephedra says yes. That a lot of times when people with heavy responsibilities pass away, they find it hard to move on.” And he says it like, “Yeah, this is the thing that happens.” Like, this is normal. And so Ginkgo has to assume that maybe this is normal amongst the grassland villages. And she makes a note to maybe research on more on this later.\nBut yeah, Ginkgo offers to perform a ritual of communication for them to speak to each other and to communicate what things Ephedra\u0026rsquo;s mother may want to be done or what kind of things will help her move on. And– and Ephedra accepts.\nSo they perform the ritual. And it\u0026rsquo;s a very oddly intimate experience for Ginkgo because this is the conversation between mother and son. And Ginkgo has to be present, to kind of facilitate it.\nBut yeah, the conversation ends up– it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s never quite clear. It\u0026rsquo;s not like words can be spoken when you\u0026rsquo;re a ghost the same way that they can when you are alive and a human. So there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of like feelings and impressions that happen.\nBut Ephedra gets the message that– well, that he interprets as his mother is worried, is worried about him, very worried about him and wants him to bring the village to somewhere new because the path that they usually take is growing a bit more harrowing in the recent years. Like, the animals that migrate are just more disturbed than they used to be. So that was what his mother was trying to get the village to agree to before. And she didn\u0026rsquo;t succeed before she passed away. So she really wants him to continue that.\nAnd then at the end, she also sends him a message that she wishes that he would start a family, because that\u0026rsquo;s important to her. And then Ephedra just has this expression like, “Uggh… not again.” And, um, Ginkgo really gets the feeling that he wishes she didn\u0026rsquo;t have to experience– or she didn\u0026rsquo;t have to witness it, this conversation between him and his mum.\nBut yeah, I think at the end of it, the issues are not resolved. Like the things that Ephedra\u0026rsquo;s mum wants are not things that he can accomplish right away or even necessarily agree to. So, um… it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, she is still there and she will not leave. And Ginkgo relays this to Ephedra and Ephedra is not surprised. But he does look a bit more relieved that he was able to even communicate with his mother. And there is a softness in his eyes when he thanks Ginkgo.\nSATAH: So card number three of Autumn is the Knave of Cups. Ooh! Got a confused kitty staring at a fish in a goblet. [Chuckling in delight] I love them. Cups are around the village. Knave is, “You need help from someone else. What do you need and who do you go to?”\nFirst thoughts are like, needing somebody with more powers. But I think that– I think that what that would lean towards is like somebody coming to me with a problem I can\u0026rsquo;t solve and I\u0026rsquo;m sort of, like, looking for help. And I think that that isn\u0026rsquo;t quite what I want to get at with this question. I think that the specific thing of having a personal problem, myself, that I can\u0026rsquo;t solve has a different emotional weight to it than being unequipped to solve someone else\u0026rsquo;s problem. And I think I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in exploring– I’m more interested in exploring having a problem that I cannot solve myself.\nAlso thinking of scale… like there\u0026rsquo;s the idea that this is something small. Like I want to learn how to play piano. So I like go and talk to somebody who can play piano.\nMmm… maybe approach this from another angle. Who is interesting to make a connection with here? One thing I think I want to be explicit about is that, like, I want Duck to move on from this place. Like I think narratively it would make a lot of sense in a lot of ways for them to stay, and Duck wants to stay, but I am interested in exploring another town in this story. And so I think this is like maybe one way to plant the seeds of that.\nWow. This is– this is tough. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve just like– there\u0026rsquo;s so many blank spaces in who Duck is and what they want that I\u0026rsquo;m really struggling. I keep coming up with new ideas that are like… one of their roommates gets injured and Duck needs– and– or says like, “You need to give this message to so and so in the next town,” before going into some sort of magical coma. And that\u0026rsquo;s totally fine but like again isn\u0026rsquo;t really coming from something within Duck that they need help with. I\u0026rsquo;ve sort of like– it\u0026rsquo;s just much easier to define the people around them and their desires.\nHmm. It\u0026rsquo;s also hard just because they are pretty self-sufficient. Like I keep trying to think of like something that could break that they need help repairing. But they\u0026rsquo;ve been sort of drawn as a very you know, handy, crafty type.\nWhat is something Duck wants that they can\u0026rsquo;t achieve? Hmm.\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;m looking for something too acute. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s like– I\u0026rsquo;ll just sort of interpret this as like, you know, I need a lot of fabric and so I need to go to a weaver who like mass produces or produces large quantities of these things, which like– I can do small things and I have a lot of little scraps but I need something big for a project. A tapestry for some reason is the thing that comes to mind. Like– ooh, it\u0026rsquo;s– I\u0026rsquo;m hesitating because I think I keep going against things that I said that I want but I think that that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nThe idea that like there\u0026rsquo;s a– there are people who are moving in together and Duck wants to like make a little– make something for their home as a– that is like a just a little protection or warmth charm or something on their on their home and they\u0026rsquo;re going to make a tapestry for these people. But they don\u0026rsquo;t have anything big enough. They don\u0026rsquo;t have like a single piece of fabric that\u0026rsquo;s big enough and and it\u0026rsquo;s important for the spell for for whatever reason like in this– this particular instance, like, they\u0026rsquo;d rather not cobble together scraps. They want like something that is– was whole and made with intention at its size and so they need to go to a weaver to pick something up.\nAnd I think specifically this is somebody who is in another town. So this– this is a little bit of a– of a journey. Maybe Connie comes with them. I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun and I\u0026rsquo;m actually just going to roll a location. This might not be the place where I end up but I do just want to see like– I want to get a sense by comparing the locations, like, how far of a journey this is.\n[Die clatter] Five: the seashore. [Gasp] That\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nOkay, so that makes me think it\u0026rsquo;s like it is a few days but it\u0026rsquo;s like we get out of the forest and then keep traveling in this little carriage or whatever for a few days. And– that also makes me think that I\u0026rsquo;m going to this specific place because this is fabric that is made out of like, kelp, or some other aquatic plant fiber, because I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun. And so it\u0026rsquo;s not just any fabric that I need. It\u0026rsquo;s specifically like– in order to make something with the specific properties that I wanted to have I need… maybe it\u0026rsquo;s like a multi elements thing like I need something from different types of elements and this is just like the most secure way to get elements of water elements into the piece? The charm? Is to get, like, water based fabrics.\nSo we go to the seashore. Takes a few days. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice little journey. Connie and Duck. And we go and we speak to the weaver of the town, who I like to think– we haven\u0026rsquo;t met, but we know each other through reputation. Maybe– so the weaver has like apprentices who they\u0026rsquo;ve sent out to markets before, and I have like– I\u0026rsquo;ve– I’ve bought like little beads made of sea glass and stuff from them and we\u0026rsquo;ve spoken and I\u0026rsquo;ve lavished praise on the care of their work before, and so this is like nice. It\u0026rsquo;s nice that we\u0026rsquo;re finally meeting face to face.\nAnd the weaver produces this– this roll of fabric that\u0026rsquo;s been like carefully woven from seaweed that\u0026rsquo;s been treated to be like, tough and soft and… fabric-y… [Laughing, sarcastic:] I know so much about textiles. This was a really great thing for me to focus on.\nI just know– I know that I have friends who may listen to this who are big textile nerds and so it\u0026rsquo;s one of those things where I very much feel my lack of knowledge much more strongly than if I were doing something that nobody I care about knows a lot about. The thing where like, you know, your favourite history podcast covers an event you know really well and you\u0026rsquo;re like oh god. Oh you\u0026rsquo;re not an expert and you did bad research. Which I know because I know this really well. Except it\u0026rsquo;s for me making up fantasy textiles. [Laughing]\nOkay um. Yeah, yeah. Weaver– weaver– kelp– kelp fabric for me to make a tapestry on. And I think we stay for a couple days because it\u0026rsquo;s a long enough journey that, like, you want to stay, you know?\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m doing it! I\u0026rsquo;m setting up I\u0026rsquo;m setting up a move. Like, we– there\u0026rsquo;s like the images of us on the beach. It\u0026rsquo;s a rock beach, there\u0026rsquo;s no sand. Like we\u0026rsquo;re sitting on the rocks with the waves splashing up over our feet and like breathing in that, just, like open thick sea air and… I\u0026rsquo;m watching the weaver work and, like, having sparks of joy as we get to, like, exchange, you know– we exchange information and expertise.\nAnd I think that we see part of this like sort of through Connie\u0026rsquo;s eyes, you know, where they are seeing Duck, like, connect with people really quickly. And you know, Duck has been happy in this forest place, but like, not easily happy. And there\u0026rsquo;s just so clearly a little bit of a connection here.\nAnd we see, like, a, you know– Connie and Duck wrapped up, sitting on a rock, staring out at the horizon and chatting. They\u0026rsquo;re all packed to leave in the morning. And Connie is like, “Is the winter worse here? Or better?”\nAnd Duck kind of smiles and laughs and shrugs and puts a hand up– like, pulls– pulls a hand that has been buried in a cardigan out and puts it up to the wind, shakes it a little bit, and is like, “That– that wind is pretty bitter but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it gets a lot colder than this. They say that, you know, the ocean moderates these things.” and smiles, puts the hand back, hides it away from the wind again.\nAnd Connie kind of watches them and is like, “You know, I– I heard that right now they\u0026rsquo;re sharing a– they\u0026rsquo;re sharing a witch. They\u0026rsquo;re sharing a healer all across the bay. There\u0026rsquo;s only one person working in these three towns.” And Duck, like, looks at Connie… and Connie kind of smiles and is like, “It seems like the air here agrees with you. Maybe you should see if they need a little more help. I know you love to help.”\nAnd Duck, like, you know, is like, “Oh… sure, but–” and like tilts– tilts their head and– unspoken silent question of like, “What about you?”\nAnd Connie looks around and they\u0026rsquo;re like, “I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be that far away. And who knows, maybe if I visit enough, I\u0026rsquo;ll realise this is the place for me, too.”\nAnd Duck like, smiles, slowly. They, like, both sort of like unbury their hands from the pile of fabric for– to– to hold hands, and they bury their hands again together. And Duck nods and is like, “Yeah. You know, maybe, before we leave I\u0026rsquo;ll– I\u0026rsquo;ll ask around. And I\u0026rsquo;ve already left my contact address so… you\u0026rsquo;re right. I think that this could be really wonderful.” and Connie squeezes their hand.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s it for– for there. I think we\u0026rsquo;ll we\u0026rsquo;ll open up on the beginning of winter, which is going to be… Duck moving to this new town, this seashore town.\nRHIANNON: And that is the final card for autumn.\nAGATHA: And that is the end of autumn.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play a podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

That wasn\u0026rsquo;t planned, but it\u0026rsquo;s beautifully fitting. I think that I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned in these episodes a couple of times that I have a tendency towards really believing in, uh, the magic of a coincidence, which occasionally can… mm. Lead me astray. But when it\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s low stakes, it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of fun and satisfying. Which is also how I feel about the fact that this is going to be the last episode of the year.\nI first started conceptualizing this show, or something very much like it, a long time ago– years at this point, I think. And then, a series of factors, such as getting medicated for ADHD, meant that I finally started working on it seriously this summer. And then, I started posting episodes– uh, kind of spontaneously? A little bit sooner than I expected, because I thought that it would be fun to have the first arc wrapped up for Halloween. And I was right. It was fun. And now, here we are. It is all very tidy and fits together in a way that\u0026rsquo;s deeply pleasant to my particular brain.\nAnd now, yet again, two of our witches are staying put, and one is moving on. We\u0026rsquo;ll spend some time with me as I build up Duck’s next home, and then the rest of the crew will join back in to set up the season and close out the year, both for them and for us.\nThank you, sincerely, for any amount of time that you have spent with me and with us, whatever it has been. I deeply appreciate it. Thank you. Let\u0026rsquo;s play a tabletop roleplaying game.\nTHE GAME RHIANNON: And now, we move into winter. This is Viv\u0026rsquo;s favorite season, and she is deciding to stay in the mountain village for another season at least.\nSATAH: So I\u0026rsquo;ve gone to title this track that I\u0026rsquo;m recording “winter”, due to that being the season I\u0026rsquo;m recording. What I\u0026rsquo;ve typed is “wubter.” I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna leave it like that. This is a game about magic. There\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as a mistake or a coincidence. That\u0026rsquo;s what the universe wanted me to type. ‘Cause of magic. Whatever.\nAGATHA: So winter is very, very cold. For Ginkgo, at least. They\u0026rsquo;ve moved locations from one part of the grassland to another. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if Ginkgo is really able to tell the difference, really. I think the elevation of the current location is lower than where the village was at before. Where they set camp. So it is a warmer place, but to Ginkgo, it just feels very, very cold. It\u0026rsquo;s starting to snow at certain times, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it snows consistently, but the wind is definitely… it feels like knives on your skin, because it\u0026rsquo;s always blowing, and in the cold, it just really dries out your skin.\nSATAH: So we already know that Duck is moving to the seashore. Let\u0026rsquo;s glance back at those other location questions.\n“Who will I miss?” Well, that\u0026rsquo;s fairly obvious, right? But I think everybody, you know? They were nice people. They\u0026rsquo;re just a lot, for the most part.\nSometimes, you know… I think a lot about a post I read about people in big cities– I think it was specifically talking about New York– sometimes being interpreted as rude, because they really give people a lot of space, and that it is actually, in a lot of ways, a defense mechanism to living in such densely packed places that, you know, you need to just pretend that other people don\u0026rsquo;t exist sometimes, and that is actually a service that you\u0026rsquo;re offering. When you\u0026rsquo;re on a crowded subway, letting everybody just pretend that they aren\u0026rsquo;t currently packed into a tube with 400 people or whatever is kind. It\u0026rsquo;s just that if you\u0026rsquo;re not from there, it might read as rude and inconsiderate. And I think that basically what I\u0026rsquo;ve established with the forest place was that they just did the opposite. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re so densely packed that, um, they just decided to always be in each other\u0026rsquo;s business all the time. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Culture! You know? It evolves.\nYeah, so I\u0026rsquo;ll miss everybody. And I do miss Connie, but I think that it isn\u0026rsquo;t terrible. It\u0026rsquo;s nice. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re going to visit. We have plans. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re gonna– they’re gonna come up and visit. They\u0026rsquo;ve even decided, like, you know, “Usually I just send some of my stuff–” because, you know, they make the jewelry and everything, and normally they just send it along to be sold with whatever sort of traveling traders come through the forest town, or whoever usually represents the wares from the forest town. And they\u0026rsquo;re like, “You know what? I miss traveling. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna start doing that.” And so they, like– they\u0026rsquo;re gonna come visit on their way to sell their stuff. And it\u0026rsquo;s like a really nice positive change in their life, too. Like, they kind of have a like, “Oh god, have I been stuck? Have I stuck myself here in a way that wasn\u0026rsquo;t totally necessary? Like, can I still be out exploring?” And so it\u0026rsquo;s like, it\u0026rsquo;s sad and it\u0026rsquo;s hard. And also it\u0026rsquo;s really good. Yeah. Yeah.\nSo, “What is the new house like?” This one I actually do have a vision of, but I am still gonna roll on those four suggestions just to– just to see. [Die clattering continuously] Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.\nMy dice fell off the table, which– Down We Go rules, means I have to kill my character. Sorry, Duck.\nUm, got “built into a cave” again. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not built into a cave. It\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s just– it\u0026rsquo;s a little, this is, like– the– the the vision I\u0026rsquo;m having of this is very much just like, you know, fishing village. Um, lots of airy sort of wood, wood and stone stone, seaside places. I think they– they live in like a– they\u0026rsquo;re, like, right on– they\u0026rsquo;re right near the water, but they can\u0026rsquo;t, like, really get into it? Like, this town is at the seashore, but it slopes up to a cliff. And they are, like, not quite– not at the top of the cliff, there\u0026rsquo;s like a lighthouse, you know, of course there has to be a lighthouse– and they live on the path to the lighthouse in just a nice little stone cabin that feels very cold when they first go in.\nBut very quickly, they put fabric up on the walls, and the weaver sends– I think the weaver– the weaver is getting on in years a little bit and doesn\u0026rsquo;t doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite want to make the trek up here just to say hi, but but sends one of their apprentices up to give them something to put on the walls and somebody comes by to show them like, you know, that the air here is is is wet. And so you have to be really careful with your– with your tinder and your– and your matches and whatever. And– and they show Duck the best way to– to coax fire out of these slightly damper just ambiently more wet logs.\nAnd it warms up and it\u0026rsquo;s– I think Duck sits on their bed, you know, after they\u0026rsquo;ve set up for the first time and they, like, smile and there\u0026rsquo;s just like this feeling of like, hope, and like, oh yeah. This– this can really work. In a way that I think we haven\u0026rsquo;t necessarily seen at their other ones, like– and in part it\u0026rsquo;s just experience, you know, like they– they didn\u0026rsquo;t know– they were so timid at the beginning, like they don\u0026rsquo;t know how much they\u0026rsquo;re allowed to change things and– and what they\u0026rsquo;re allowed to do. But here they arrive, they make the place their own. And they\u0026rsquo;ve also just acquired a lot more memories and physical stuff. People have given them things and items and they put them around and they like– it isn\u0026rsquo;t this feeling, totally, of a of a new beginning, you know, it isn\u0026rsquo;t it isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is fresh and– not fresh, but like– it isn\u0026rsquo;t– there isn\u0026rsquo;t like a hard sever of like, their life before in their life now. They are surrounded by these like tokens of people they\u0026rsquo;ve lived with and people they\u0026rsquo;ve helped and it has a sense of continuity and a beginning in a way that like, they– that– that is invigorating and exciting.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t have a garden because I\u0026rsquo;m– I\u0026rsquo;m on stone, you know? Like, stuff does grow near here. There are– people like, people can grow things. Even I probably could if I were really dedicated, but it would have to be like– I\u0026rsquo;d have to put, you know, pots and stuff down and that just isn\u0026rsquo;t something that Duck is super focused on.\n“Is it haunted or is there an animal friend that comes to visit?” There\u0026rsquo;s gotta be seagulls and they\u0026rsquo;re super chatty. But I think– is it haunted? Yeah. I think this is a– especially because this is an old town, I think. You know, people always spring up around water pretty early and so it\u0026rsquo;s haunted, but… pleasantly.\nI think– so, I\u0026rsquo;m on the path to the lighthouse and I think that, like, the- the specific spirit that that really hangs out is someone who loved a lighthouse keeper, you know? And– and lived here and– and– and pined a bit, staring up at the light, and then started to– to walk up to the lighthouse, and they fell in love and– and whatever. This was a long time ago. And maybe it\u0026rsquo;s even like, the ghost of that lighthouse keeper still haunts the lighthouse itself, and so there\u0026rsquo;s this, like, sort of, like, beautiful sad thing where these two lovers are both still here, but can\u0026rsquo;t see each other? But I love the idea that– they both, like– have a tendency to– like, um– this– [Laughing]\nI figure this out because the lighthouse keeper appears at my door and I’m like, is– I open it and it\u0026rsquo;s like, it\u0026rsquo;s like, early in the morning, you know? Like, like it would generally be considered rude to call this early– to call someone\u0026rsquo;s house this early and I open the door I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Is everything okay? Are you okay?”\nAnd this, like, kind of tired looking lighthouse keeper is like, “Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s the end of my shift. I saw a light on here last night and I– I just had to–” and, like, hands me a note.\nAnd I read it and I look up at her in confusion, the lighthouse keeper, and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “We just met. This is a little intense.”\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, “Oh no god I\u0026rsquo;m sorry I thought maybe somebody would have explained– um, it\u0026rsquo;s not from me to you, it\u0026rsquo;s, uh–” and explains the thing about the two ghosts and is like, “Yeah, so, this is actually something– this is a huge relief for me, because I used to have to bring these notes here and then wait for, like– keep coming by until the ghost that is haunting here could, you know, conjure up a reply, and– and now someone\u0026rsquo;s living here, so you will just be able to get it and then you can bring it to me, and that\u0026rsquo;s great.”\nSo basically these two ghosts are in a short long distance relationship where they send notes back and forth that they do– do— that– ghost powers make the note– but also probably I will start writing the notes… for her? The ghost, you know? I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Hey that seems really hard for you… you have to, like, physically manifest something\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier to just talk to me. I\u0026rsquo;ll write it down for you; I don\u0026rsquo;t mind…” and we bond a little! Over, you know, long distance relationships.\nOkay. So I can– yep– uh, wow. That– I, okay. Got really into that question.\nAnd I think \u0026ldquo;initial impression of the village and who do I meet first\u0026rdquo; was, uh, was already sort of established. I like these people. I connect with the weaver and the weaver starts introducing me to other people. And I just feel like I\u0026rsquo;m– I\u0026rsquo;m quickly fitting in.\nI think that there is a little bit of an anxiety because, like– you know, Duck loves doing all the prep work for fall and so moving somewhere where they haven\u0026rsquo;t done that, is like, terrifying. But I think that one of the comforts for them is probably that they saw people doing that work, like, really putting an effort towards it, and they\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, that is part of the culture here, you know. And so they\u0026rsquo;re they\u0026rsquo;re they\u0026rsquo;re prepared to feel safe here despite not having done the work themselves.\nAGATHA: “There\u0026rsquo;s an occasional bite in the air as the seasons change yet again,”\nRHIANNON: “autumn giving way and the as much of the world begins to sleep for the winter.”\nAGATHA: “What candles do you light in the dark of winter evenings? What drinks keep you warm on a cold night? What do you enjoy about winter?”\nRHIANNON: The drinks part is interesting. You know, I think– I think as far as candles she\u0026rsquo;s pretty, uh, unceremonious about it, kind of workmanlike. Where it\u0026rsquo;s like, yeah, she has some candles. It\u0026rsquo;s dark. She\u0026rsquo;s gonna light them.\nSATAH: They\u0026rsquo;re like– everything has to be lanterns here, right? Like the wind is so unpredictable and everything can just be so damp that everything has to be these these little glass lanterns. Oh, and I think we see like a– a memorabilia from the desert place. Like, you know, I was living in that place with the– with the glass art and everything, and so I think we see, like– I pull out a lantern that was… a lantern that was designed by that same artist that they, like, left for me, or that was given to me as a gift or something. And there\u0026rsquo;s a– there\u0026rsquo;s a– you see, like, you know– for a couple nights, I\u0026rsquo;m like tinkering with things and I manage to, like, sort of– use– like, carefully remove the glass from that lantern and put it into a lantern that\u0026rsquo;s more like designed for this– this climate, and their sources of fuel.\nAnd so I have this, like– I have a bunch of, like, regular lanterns too, but I also specifically have this one beautiful one that, like, casts these fascinating patterns on the wall when a candle is lit. And it\u0026rsquo;s just, like, soothing and comforting, and has the feeling of warmth. Like… it\u0026rsquo;s not the warmth of a desert, like, it\u0026rsquo;s not– it\u0026rsquo;s not oppressive. It\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s the warmth of, like, a rock that\u0026rsquo;s been in the sun all day, and that it\u0026rsquo;s now night, but it\u0026rsquo;s still holding that heat. Like, there\u0026rsquo;s just just something about it, when this specific lantern is lit, every surface that you sink into sort of has that, like, feeling, of that residual energy– that residual heat, just still sitting with you and then gently dissipating.\nAGATHA: What candles does Ginkgo light? I think Ginkgo actually has, like, um, like, a witch lamp. And this is something that is maybe a bit more of a splurge. It is also a sign of status that witches get these and then they light them. They don\u0026rsquo;t use the usual fuel, like animal fat or things like that, that others may use. Instead they use a very specific combination of plants, and then infused with witch magic through incantations and so on. But also, I think there\u0026rsquo;s like– it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say whether it\u0026rsquo;s drawing from nature or if it\u0026rsquo;s drawing from something within witches or if it\u0026rsquo;s like, you just need to do the incantations right and use the right ingredients and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say and different people have different theories. But, it– generally, witch lamps can only be lit by witches. And Ginkgo has one of those.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s– so it has a base and then there\u0026rsquo;s a there\u0026rsquo;s a glass globe in the middle and then there\u0026rsquo;s also a handle on top and then within it is this pretty warm glow. It\u0026rsquo;s not as warm as a firelight? There\u0026rsquo;s a tinge of maybe something like purple to it, but generally it\u0026rsquo;s still quite warm.\nSATAH: “What drinks keep you warm on a cold night?” It\u0026rsquo;s me and the lighthouse keeper, right? Like it starts with like you know we\u0026rsquo;re we\u0026rsquo;re communicating occasionally and I– I– I pad up there in the night sometimes to bring a letter and sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s a storm and I stay. And they make me this warm tea that\u0026rsquo;s very strong. Like, they laugh the first time, I drink it because I make a face and they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Oh, yeah yeah yeah no. It takes a little getting used to but uh it\u0026rsquo;ll fortify you.” and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “O-okay okay. Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll uh– I\u0026rsquo;ll give it a go.”\nAnd, you know, they make this this tea that they– they sort of hand grind up there– they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Listen my job\u0026rsquo;s important, but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of downtime. I need other hobbies.” and they– it\u0026rsquo;s, like, probably, again, seaweed and that kind of thing. It\u0026rsquo;s some special herb that grows– or it\u0026rsquo;s a moss. It\u0026rsquo;s a moss that grows on the cliff wall near the lighthouse that they dry and they grind into– into a tea and they give me a sachet of it to bring home and it does like warm me up quite a bit.\nAnd I think sort of in exchange, I like– sometimes when I\u0026rsquo;m– when I\u0026rsquo;m– when I\u0026rsquo;m up there, I sort of go around repairing a bunch of their like– you know so many lighthouse keepers have lived here and it\u0026rsquo;s just like– stuff has just been left, you know? Like there’s a mug from sixty years ago and the lighthouse keeper is like, “I don\u0026rsquo;t– I have no idea who liked that. It\u0026rsquo;s so garish,” uh, and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “I kind of like it!”\nAnd I just, like– I\u0026rsquo;m going around and digging stuff out of storage that the lighthouse keeper, like– that– that she\u0026rsquo;s just never bothered to do, and I\u0026rsquo;m digging it out and I\u0026rsquo;m fixing a bunch of stuff. And so I like carefully glue together– there\u0026rsquo;s like, you know, a set of teacups that she really likes but there\u0026rsquo;s only one left and I find the remnants of all of the other five ones and and bring them home and carefully glue them back together, fix what I can, and bring them back, and they\u0026rsquo;ve got little charms that are like, you know… keep the tea warm a little longer, or– there\u0026rsquo;s one that\u0026rsquo;s like, if you drink from this cup while you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve a difficult problem, you are more likely to be able to see the problem from a new perspective– like, an angle you haven\u0026rsquo;t considered– and all of them have like slightly different little charms like that. And yeah, they give me the tea in– in exchange. It isn\u0026rsquo;t a direct exchange; we just now have a habit of giving each other stuff.\nRHIANNON: I think, as she is, uh, sort of expecting more work for the healing part of her job in the winter, she may stay up a bit later sometimes, so maybe she has some kind of tea that\u0026rsquo;s grown up here in the mountains, right? Something to help her stay warm and stay awake a little bit longer, just in case somebody really needs her help.\nAGATHA: Uh, “what drinks keep her warm on a cold night?” Uh, Ginkgo drinks alcohol with the rest of the grassland village, um, after that attack. And, um, because she was there she was able to help– well, not while the stampede happens, but afterwards, and calm everyone down, and so on. Like, that definitely draws the village closer to Ginkgo and so they invite her to drink with them. Sometimes they have milk, um, and then sometimes they have, um, alcohol, that they drink together, and it really does help keep you warm, to a certain point. Um, and that\u0026rsquo;s kind of like their bonding activity, and she is doing it more now. She\u0026rsquo;s– I think she understands that this is a part of how to get closer, um, to other people and she doesn\u0026rsquo;t always enjoy the activities necessarily, but she likes the feeling of getting closer to people, and the feeling of acceptance is very appealing for her, so she does partake in that.\nSATAH: “What do you enjoy about winter?” I mean, as I kind of established before, all the clothes. Everybody\u0026rsquo;s bundled up. It\u0026rsquo;s great.\nAnd I think something I specifically enjoy about winter here is that it quickly becomes obvious that this town takes its rest very seriously. They do a lot of, like, harvest during the summer– like, summers are sort of non-stop, and many of the other seasons are very non-stop, but in the winter, they are very serious about recuperating. And so it is like– there is just this very intentional energy of like, a lot of stuff can wait. If we don\u0026rsquo;t need to do this now, we don\u0026rsquo;t do it now. Now, we rest and we honour the work that we\u0026rsquo;ve done throughout the rest of the year, and we very intentionally come together. We don\u0026rsquo;t isolate ourselves to recover; we have a lot of big communal dinners and, uh, cultivate warmth and connection and– and we, we are slow and gentle with each other. And this is– this is, like, a beautiful thing that– that– that– the season gives us permission to do.\nAnd so I think I find a lot of like. Oh. It ends up that moving here for the winter was great because this is when like they are incredibly deliberate about community bonding during this. So I’m just very brought in, immediately.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s good for me! I think like, you know– a– a– a small throughline through a lot of this has been Duck being, like, wanting to help all of the time, right? And, like, that\u0026rsquo;s not bad, but I think that it\u0026rsquo;s a good… it\u0026rsquo;s good for them to– to be pulled into a community where they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Okay, what can I offer?” and they are told, like, “The best thing that you can do for us right now is nothing. If we need you, we will tell you– thank you– but the thing that we really need right now is for you to sit down, put your feet up, and listen to me reading this story out loud, because it\u0026rsquo;s the thing that we do at the beginning of every winter. We read this story out loud, one chapter, every single night, and then when we\u0026rsquo;re done, we have a big party and we do a play recreating it. Sit. Have some cider. That is your contribution.”\nAnd I– that\u0026rsquo;s good. That\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s good. That\u0026rsquo;s a good feeling to have. It\u0026rsquo;s a good– good lesson to learn. Let’s pull some cards!\nRHIANNON: As far as what she enjoys about winter, she likes the intensity of the work and she likes the intensity of the quiet when it snows. But up here, in the mountains it\u0026rsquo;s probably entirely different from what she\u0026rsquo;s used to in terms of just how intense all of those things can get. Um, there\u0026rsquo;s probably, you know– when there\u0026rsquo;s the first– first big snow of the winter, there\u0026rsquo;s just this moment of absolute wonder for her as she\u0026rsquo;s seeing what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be at this elevation when it gets this cold. What the mountain looks like with the snow on it, what it\u0026rsquo;s like to look down at the village the morning after a big snow. It\u0026rsquo;s still fresh. So that\u0026rsquo;s probably something special for her there.\nAGATHA: “What does she enjoy most about winter?” I think it is, um, the times that she gets to spend with people. Especially, I think, the elders of the village, who are great storytellers. And like, in the darkness of winter, um, when you\u0026rsquo;re just often inside the tents, um, that\u0026rsquo;s when the storytelling really takes over as like the major entertainment, and also just the major thing that you do, really.\nUm, and she\u0026rsquo;s hearing a lot about the stories of the village, uh– the stories of previous elders. And then, um, occasionally she gets tales of Ephedra\u0026rsquo;s mother, the previous, um, previous elder, who is sort of still haunting Ephedra, um. But just in a less, uh, strong sense. Like, she might be– she\u0026rsquo;s having some of her– her wishes fulfilled and she gets to communicate with her son, so, uh, maybe that will start to fade more and more.\nBut, um, in the times when Ginkgo hears, uh, from the other elders– the older people in the village about the village leader, that\u0026rsquo;s when she really gets a stronger understanding of the pride of the village. Um, what they hold to be good and true, and then also the ties that bind them to each other.\nVery clearly, Ginkgo wanted to learn more about this village. She did not move on, um, when the seasons changed. So, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s– that\u0026rsquo;s where she\u0026rsquo;s at. I will draw my first card.\nRHIANNON: Let\u0026rsquo;s start drawing cards.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s pull some cards.\nRHIANNON: First we have the king of swords. “You spend some time working on your records, whether a journal or a book of shadows or a recipe book. What is your favourite way to record things?”\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s pretty– pretty mundane for her. It\u0026rsquo;s just– she keeps a journal, um, full of like– probably what the scene is, is she\u0026rsquo;s taking the, like, kind of scattered notes that she was taking as she was studying on how to live here, and she\u0026rsquo;s actually putting them into, like, an actual journal, right? Like she\u0026rsquo;s binding them in there and then putting a bunch of blank pages in as well so she can keep writing in there.\nAnd so I\u0026rsquo;m just imagining a scene of her sort of sitting at the kitchen table, drinking some tea. It\u0026rsquo;s starting to get late, and she\u0026rsquo;s, you know– maybe as she\u0026rsquo;s fitting– finishing up dinner she starts to get out the materials to bind her notes here into a book, um, to serve as an actual journal for her, for reference later. Now that she\u0026rsquo;s decided to spend her third season here, she\u0026rsquo;s choosing to make you know something that was a little more transient– like some notes on scraps of paper or parchment or whatever– into something a little more durable that she expects to keep for a while. And we just kind of sit with her through the work of putting together this object, you know. It\u0026rsquo;s not fancy, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that– it\u0026rsquo;s something that she intends to keep, and that matters when she hasn\u0026rsquo;t really had something like that before.\nSATAH: Six of swords. Reversed. I know that that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything in this game, but I do just need– feel the need to note it. Swords are around the home; six, “While walking outside near your house you find a crystal in the ground dropped by a previous occupant. You clean it up and cleanse its energy. What does it look like? Do you incorporate it into your own practice or give it to someone else?” Huh!\nSo I see, like, a sparkling on the ground and I just assume sea glass. And there\u0026rsquo;s just stuff that\u0026rsquo;s all over here. And I come closer and it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s immediately very obvious that this is from somewhere else. Um this is a gem that– the kind of gem that only gets made under enormous pressure underground and that kind of thing, which I only know because Connie taught me how to recognise that stuff, um.\nWho is it from?! It isn\u0026rsquo;t the ghost…\nSo first I save it for a little while because, like, as established, there is a witch who travels through here sometimes, so I\u0026rsquo;m like, maybe it belongs to them. And then they come through and I’m like, “Is this yours?”\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, “No. I’ve never seen that before in my life. I kind of don\u0026rsquo;t like its vibe.”\nAnd I’m like– I’m like, “I also kind of don\u0026rsquo;t like its vibe. I\u0026rsquo;m really glad that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t yours.” and together, we do– cleanse it, yeah. We do the– we do the cleansing thing.\nAnd… mm! for the drama, this is a– this is a crystal that was used as a payment for… the person that killed the lighthouse keeper… ghost. [Laughing] Um, that lighthouse keeper was assassinated! Uh, she was killed because somebody was trying to cause a big shipwreck, um, for nefarious purposes. And so she was killed so that they could, like, mess with the lighthouse signal! And this crystal was used as payment for that assassin, um, who– who fled. Who fled the scene and dropped some of this stuff a very long time ago.\nSo we cleanse it and it\u0026rsquo;s great. And I don\u0026rsquo;t incorporate it into my practice. I– I give it to Connie. Connie comes through and we catch up. It\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s been a– it\u0026rsquo;s been a few weeks. It can\u0026rsquo;t be more than a month, really, since I moved, I think, just because, like, I’m– I’m thinking of these as like one incident a month– but it\u0026rsquo;s been a few weeks and– and a lot has happened in those few weeks. Um, maybe– yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s been, like, six weeks. The– the last thing happened, you know, near the beginning of a month; this is happening near the end of the next month.\nConnie comes through on– on their way to a market and I– we catch up on everything. I– I talk about my burgeoning connection with the lighthouse keeper and, and they\u0026rsquo;re so excited and thrilled, and they talk about dalliances they\u0026rsquo;ve had on the road and– and say, like, being a traveling trader– that they\u0026rsquo;d kind of forgotten that you can, like, meet more people and– and– and have more of those like, romantic connections for a night, or whatever– that it just gives you more opportunity to have those in a way that\u0026rsquo;s been, like, really fulfilling.\nAnd yeah, I give them this crystal and they stay for a few days and it\u0026rsquo;s really wonderful. And then they keep going on their trail and they say that they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to stop by on their way back as well, and that they\u0026rsquo;ll maybe try to make something out of this– out of this crystal on the road if they can, but they might not be able to.\nAGATHA: Ten of spades. “You take a spell bath using herbs, crystals, and maybe even some fruit to prepare the water. What comfort or healing do you hope to receive from the ritual?” That is extremely luxurious for this village at this moment. I almost feel like I don\u0026rsquo;t want to use this prompt because I just feel– like that feels kind of wasteful. Unless… unless maybe we go to a hot spring. Actually, yeah. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep this card and say the village maybe takes like a short trip to a nearby hot spring..? Hmm. Or it can be, uh, the kind of bath that you take where it is just like a small bucket of water and you just– you just take a cloth and you rub it over your body, um, using the water, as opposed to an actual soak. Um, because, again, I think at this time and in this environment, like, water is not an easily accessible resource, and so I don\u0026rsquo;t think it should be freely used for a soak. Um… yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll go with that.\nUm, so… yeah this is– this is a ritual bath. And I think this has to do with, um, preparation for a celebration that might be coming, or celebration, or maybe like, um, a ritual to remember and give thanks to the ancestors, that sort of thing. So whoever leads this ritual, um, will need to partake in ritual cleansing. And so, um, as the village witch, Ginkgo is definitely one of the people who will be leading a part of this ceremony. Uh, the village leader will also be doing that and that is Ephedra, of course, and so they each have to do that.\nI think Ginkgo is the one who sets it up because, again, like the components and things like that are things that only the village witch has knowledge of. So she\u0026rsquo;s going to create, uh– she\u0026rsquo;s going to prepare two… separate… baths. Or she\u0026rsquo;s going to prepare one for herself first, and then after she\u0026rsquo;s done, she will prepare one for Ephedra.\nSo, um, it\u0026rsquo;s, um… even the preparation process is a ritual. Like, you put in one thing first, and then you put in another, and with putting each component in– each herb, each crystal, each um animal part– you say, like, a phrase about what it does, and then what kind of effect, and then also what kind of meaning it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to bring to this ritual cleansing. And then at the end, um, she then dips the cloth in and then, uh, cleanses herself. And that part is the shortest part because it is very cold. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, ahh!! A quick scrub, um, to to get through the whole thing.\nAnd then, um, “What comfort or healing do you hope to receive from the ritual?” I mean, I feel like it is nice to be able to clean yourself. And, um, the smell of the bath water is quite fragrant, actually. Um, it has this, uh– like– maybe it might smell like, uh, a bit smoky, actually? Smoky, but also, like– I think there\u0026rsquo;s a kind of grass in there that has this, like bitter sweet, um, scent. And so it\u0026rsquo;s like, smoky and bittersweet, um, and when you smell it, you feel like, uh, you passed through flames, and like all of the part of you that was, uh– like all the impurities have been kind of burned off– is– is the– is what the smell evokes. And so I think being able to clean herself and then also like feeling like, yes, like, those aspects of myself, I can cast them behind. All the negative emotions, and then all of the tiredness that may have been building up, um, that\u0026rsquo;s what Ginkgo wishes, uh, to release with this cleansing.\nAnd after she\u0026rsquo;s done, then she goes through the same proce– she dumps out the water and then, uh, she draws another bucket, and then, um, goes through the same process. And then she summons Ephedra and then, um, he comes in. Ginkgo instructs him on the– the way to do it, and he says… he– he looks like he wants to say that he knows how to do it, because he has done it before, but he bites his tongue and gives her the respect of listening to her go through the process again. Because that\u0026rsquo;s probably also like a yearly thing– like, you always listen to the village witch tell you how to do it, even if at this point you are very familiar with the process.\nAnd then, um, Ginkgo will draw a curtain between where he is and where she is, inside the tent, and she\u0026rsquo;s just going to wait. She\u0026rsquo;s not going outside. Um, and I think there is like a moment of hesitation from Ephedra, because– I think this is how it was done the years before as well, but the village witch before was not someone that was so young and attractive like um, like Ginkgo. So I think there is a moment where he\u0026rsquo;s like… [Uncomfortable humming]… but– but then he\u0026rsquo;s like, “No, nope this is a part of the ritual. I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna go through with it,” and he does.\nAndIi think it is also very distracting to Ginkgo, um, like, as she sits there and she\u0026rsquo;s like, “Okay.” thinking about the actual ceremony and all that stuff like, “These are the things that I need.” and she\u0026rsquo;s kind of, like, wrestling through her, uh– all of her materials, but she can\u0026rsquo;t help but be distracted, uh, by, uh, hearing him, like, ritually cleansing himself. So yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s uh– that\u0026rsquo;s that. That card.\nSATAH: H– [Loud Garold meowing, which continues repeatedly in the background] I was gonna say now he\u0026rsquo;s being polite. But he psychically inferred I was about to say that and screamed.\nCard number two. Again, reversed, not that it matters. Ooh, wait! Ohh this is two cards. This is two cards because they were stuck together. Ooh, what should I do?! Let\u0026rsquo;s look at both of them.\nFascinatingly, they\u0026rsquo;re both wands. We\u0026rsquo;ve got the king of wands and the six of wands. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna look at both of them. Maybe combine them. Because in– in tarot and games of magic, I– I gotta assume that there\u0026rsquo;s some intentionality to stuff that happens.\nSo wands are around the home. Six is, “You discover a new ability. What is it and how do you discover it?” and king is, “You find something left by a previous occupant. What is it and what do you do with it?”\n[Insistent meow] Garold has ideas.\nI gotta combine them. So I, like– I find something and discover a new ability or discover a new ability and it helps me to find something. Okay.\nSo… discovering a new ability is difficult because I don\u0026rsquo;t, like, have a full sense of what the limitations of my abilities even are at the moment. I think this makes– I– I want this to be related to the ghost. [Gentle gasp] So I find… yeah. Okay. This is going to be slightly odd to explain.\nSo… Duck finds like… a… an instrument in the attic. Um, an old, like, stringed instrument. A lute or something. A mandolin. And it has, like, not been treated super well by the sea air but luckily like, this attic– that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know was was there, you know; I– I– find it while like cleaning, uh, or something– I find like a hidden latch and realise that it opens to a secret compartment that is so small up there. Like, I can sort of get in there. I can\u0026rsquo;t stand fully, but I can haul myself up there, and there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of storage, and–\n[Soft meow, admonishingly:] Garold.\nAnd I find this– this mandolin. And it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s surprisingly, like, been okay, like, considering the– like, how long it\u0026rsquo;s been there– years and years– decades– and the– the salt air– this is just well sealed enough that it\u0026rsquo;s fairly okay. And– and I bring it downstairs, and I hear music from it and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s like a player piano. I– I don\u0026rsquo;t see how the mechanism works, but it must have one, because I can hear these beautiful songs playing from it.”\nAnd my ghost appears that night, you know. The moon rises, she fades in. And we\u0026rsquo;re just existing quietly together, and, and the the mandolin is playing, and at a certain point I go, “Oh, this is that song you\u0026rsquo;re always humming, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?”\nAnd she looks at me in great surprise and she\u0026rsquo;s like, “What– what do you mean? What– what song?”\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Oh, the– the song that\u0026rsquo;s playing right now,” and I gesture towards the mandolin.\nAnd she looks at the mandolin, and she looks at me, and there\u0026rsquo;s, you know, shock on her transparent face, and she goes, like, “You can hear that?”\nAnd I’m like, “Y… es? I- I mean– I don’t really know how it works but I– I figured it was like a– a player piano or just a– a little enchantment that– of course I can hear it.”\nAnd she just kind of shakes her head slowly and she\u0026rsquo;s like, “There\u0026rsquo;s no music playing. I can hear it. I can always hear it. But the living shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to hear it.”\nAnd Duck is like, “Wh… what… w-what do you mean?”\nAnd, you know, she talks about– there\u0026rsquo;s– ghosts aren\u0026rsquo;t always just people, or something, or like, there\u0026rsquo;s spiritual energies that– that can linger that– that you only really are supposed to be able to touch if you are also a ghost, if you are if you are dead. That this is– this is music that is playing from the other side. That this is– this is the lingering memory of music. That it is not being played right now.\nAnd she says, like, “Look closer.” and I look closer at the mandolin and realise that like– it\u0026rsquo;s actually in terrible shape. That it has– all of the strings are snapped and that they haven\u0026rsquo;t been– like whenever I\u0026rsquo;ve sort of glanced at it, I\u0026rsquo;ve just seen like a well put together mandolin with the strings vibrating slightly as it– as it plays, and then I– I look more closely at it and realise, like, oh. No, there are no strings on that. They all snapped. The body is super cracked and it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely not capable of playing music.\nAnd it becomes obvious that I have some sort of connection… like deep connection to the– the death realm. And I think that the ghost, like, admits that she was pretty surprised how easy it was to talk with me? That, you know, she\u0026rsquo;s she\u0026rsquo;s had to manifest the notes to her lighthouse keeper lover all of these years because it normally takes an enormous amount of energy to speak with the living, but that she found it really easy with me. And she just sort of quietly– she kept it to herself because she was a little scared! She\u0026rsquo;s like, “Does that mean that you\u0026rsquo;re dead? But you don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be? I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand what you are. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to accept this as a blessing or whatever.”\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Oh.” And I think, you know, we talk, and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “I\u0026rsquo;ve always kind of been able to talk to ghosts. Like, I did it at home when i was growing up all the time. I thought that that was just something that people did.”\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, “Nope, not really.”\nAnd I think that ultimately what it comes down to is that, like, I have to do some studying. Of– of ghosts and necromantic stuff. Um. I have to ask the order to send me some books. And they\u0026rsquo;re very suspicious about why I\u0026rsquo;m asking for these specific books, and they send someone along with them– they\u0026rsquo;re like, you know, “We can\u0026rsquo;t just send this book off into the world without it being–” uh– uh– “accompanied.”\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, “That\u0026rsquo;s totally fine. I would love to talk about this with somebody.”\nAnd talk about, like, the gh– the theory of ghosts as emotional memory. And it becomes the leading theory for me that, like, the work that I do with fabrics, and the– the work that i do with, like, channeling the emotional components of clothing and accessories and that kind of thing into a power source has just, like, opened something inside of myself that, like, connects really intensely with memory and the resonance of strong emotions. And that– that is what ghosts are, and that is the thing that lingers beyond death, right? Is– is those feelings and those memories. And I\u0026rsquo;ve just, like, without meaning to, really been working out those specific muscles in my other practices. And that is why I can hear this broken mandolin playing old tunes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s like, somebody used to lay here, alone, at night, just playing this music, and it would filter down to the village, and it would filter across the sea, up to the lighthouse, and this was like, the way that this person– this musician, like, kept a connection with other people, even from a distance, was being able to like play for themselves and for other people. And so it\u0026rsquo;s very imbued with that energy. And so I can still hear it. Most of the living can\u0026rsquo;t, but I can.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s something I can do. And I bet that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more I can do as I explore it. Probably not in this game, but in the future. In Duck\u0026rsquo;s mysterious future.\nAGATHA: Right, major arcana. And I rolled a twenty. Judgement. Whoa! Okay. “It\u0026rsquo;s time to make a change in life, whether in your own habits and rituals or in how you relate to others. What is this change and how is it for the better?”\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since Ginkgo has, um, even thought about, um, her ex-fiance. Life has just been pretty busy and full of changes for this past year. Which was a part of what Ginkgo was expecting, because, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s just– when you have a full-time all-consuming role in a village, it just tends to eat up your attention. But also, addressing to all the changes and things like that, she knew that it was going to preoccupy her and that was what she wanted. She wanted to prove herself. She wanted the distraction from the heartbreak, of being basically cast aside by the person that she was– she thought she was going to marry.\nBut when it actually happens, I think this is just like, uh– one of the days of winter when she realises, “Oh yeah. I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about it.” After she sent that one letter, never got a letter back, and she\u0026rsquo;s kind of reflecting on her present and the things that occupy her mind. Helping the village that she\u0026rsquo;s in, um, setting down roots in each village has been a big part of her goal.\nAnd I think this is the moment where Gingko admits it to herself: that she is also getting quite distracted by someone specific in the village as well. And before she can fully say the name of the person to herself, um, the bell that hangs outside of her tent rings, and, um, this is someone asking to– to come in. And turns out, it\u0026rsquo;s Ephedra.\nAnd when he comes in, he has sort of, like, a nervous expression on his face, which is very rare to see. Um, I think the last time that we really saw it was, um, basically the stampede. Or, actually, no, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t a nervous expression– that was an intensely focused, um, expression– when he was trying to help, uh, redirect the stampede, and also basically help save the villagers that might have been in its way.\nI think the last time that we saw it was when he had that conversation, uh, with the ghost of his mother. Uh, where she was like, “Well, these are my wishes, one of which is that you are going to get married. You\u0026rsquo;re going to find someone and get married.” and he just has that expression you know it molded from, like… joy and grief, um… at being able to speak to his dead mother who has been haunting him uh to this kind of like… oh mom, no, please…\nAnd, yeah seeing his expression, uh, Ginkgo is reminded of that memory, and then she realises that… oh, yeah. That was the expression. That was what his expression meant when he glanced over briefly at me. He was nervous about something. And this also makes Ginkgo nervous, and so she stands…\nActually, I don\u0026rsquo;t think she stands. I feel like the tents are– you can stand up in them, but it\u0026rsquo;s not super comfortable. So I think she just kind of shifts so that she gives him her full attention and asks, um, “What do you need?”\nAnd he sits down in front of her crosses his legs and has a very formal posture, um, and he says, “My mother has spoken to me again.”\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, “Okay.”\nAnd then he\u0026rsquo;s like, “No. No, that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s not how– I– let me try again. Are you– do you plan on staying in this village?”\nAnd Ginkgo blinks, because she has been thinking about that. She– she wants to, I think, on one hand, because she really does like this village. She likes the villagers. She likes how close it feels. Um, she also likes that it\u0026rsquo;s not static? That the village does move, so she can move between different places and see new sites while staying with the same people.\nBut at the same time, it is extremely cold, and there are a lot of things that she\u0026rsquo;s just not used to, and that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know if she\u0026rsquo;ll ever get used to them. That\u0026rsquo;s one of those things where you can never be sure, right, when you leave home?\nSo she hesitates and he notices that and he says, “I– I don\u0026rsquo;t want to force your decision. I just wanted to express that I would– I would really like it if you stayed.” and when he says that… the look that he gives her– well, first of all, he is definitely blushing, um, from what she can notice, but also there is a kind of, um, vulnerability in his eyes.\nAnd she adjusts her posture to be more formal now and she says, “Ephedra, I’ve been meaning to ask you. One of your mother\u0026rsquo;s requests was for you to be wed. Did you– do you already have someone in mind for it?”\nAnd Ephedra freezes and looks at her, unsure, because in his mind, he thought he just expressed who he had in mind. So he\u0026rsquo;s not sure if this is like some kind of a rejection, um. Anyway his mind is going– is going so fast, trying to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s happening, while Gingko’s kind of also watching him to see his response.\nAnd when he doesn\u0026rsquo;t– like, when he seems to freeze, she says, “If you already had the– already had someone in mind, um, I. Well. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to force your decision or anything. I– I do think that it would be good for you to… um… to start fulfilling the– the things that your mother has said that she wishes for you to do. Um. Well, I– I want to. I would like to stay, but I think it will be hard for me to stay if Ii have to see you wed someone else.” and now Gingko is blushing very hard\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the end of this card.\nRHIANNON: Here we have the three of swords. Very– very sword season. Alright. Three of swords, “Someone comes to you in need of counsel.” Oh, let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nI think this is probably, uh– this is a situation where even getting to her house, right, having it be like kind of on a hill overlooking the village, and having it– there be snow on the ground and everything is going to be pretty difficult. So I imagine this is someone who like, you know– this is pretty serious.\nUh, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not actually something serious. Maybe this is– maybe this is the baker coming up to the cabin again. And maybe she acts at first, like– like she\u0026rsquo;s kind of making an excuse to come up here, right? She comes up asking for advice, but uh, it quickly becomes clear that the thing she\u0026rsquo;s asking for advice on is something that she could have figured out herself, right? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s some some kind of health related thing regarding, like, the winter, right, and staying safe while working in the winter, or like something with preserving food or ingredients for the bakery, right, so that it– they don\u0026rsquo;t get moisture in them from the snow and they\u0026rsquo;re not going bad and et cetera.\nAnd it quickly becomes clear that this is something that, if she\u0026rsquo;s been living here this long, she already knows it, and she actually, um, just wanted to come and talk to Viv some more. And she\u0026rsquo;s– I think Viv is a little bit, um, perplexed by this, at first, but she\u0026rsquo;s– she\u0026rsquo;s happy for the company. And so the two of them– I’m imagining the two of them just sitting kind of late into the night at Viv\u0026rsquo;s kitchen table, um, talking. And, you know, enjoying each other\u0026rsquo;s company.\nAGATHA: And I\u0026rsquo;ll draw my last card for winter. A five of diamonds. “You visit the village bakery. What is your favourite food there?” I love that. Oh, what a contrast.\nUm… I don\u0026rsquo;t think the village has a bakery, first of all. [Laughing]\nUm, I think she– I\u0026rsquo;ll say that, uh, Ginkgo visits– one of the– one of the families. And they are known– at least, um, one of them is known, for making very very good dessert. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that. And they bring it up– um, they bring it out when Gingko arrives. It is, um– I think it\u0026rsquo;s a kind of, um– um– pancake sort of, uh, thing, that– that has, um, herbs and, um, and meat inside. Uh it\u0026rsquo;s the kind that is like, cumin, uh– that kind of a spicy dessert. And so it goes really well, um, with alcohol and that is what they have while they spend time together. And it is, um– is a good time. Uh, they– they eat and Gingko obviously compliments them and say that, “Um, I think that this whole village is very good at making food but really, uh, your pancakes are my favourite.”\nAnd uh, yeah, I think one of the couple– he kind of preens and is like, “Yes, I know, I’m so good,” and then he is like, ready to– um, after Ginkgo leaves– to go and brag to everyone else that “the village witch said that mine was the best. Uh, no biggie.”\nAnd then, like, during the conversation, um, one of the kids of– of the couple, um, actually comes into the tent, and like, will like, come closer to where all the– where all the adults are gathered and say– and, like, tug on Gingko’s sleeve and– and ask, “Oh village witch, village witch, I heard– I heard that you and uh the village leader are– are going to get married! Is that true?”\nAnd Ginkgo does a spit take. And is– this is just that moment where she\u0026rsquo;s like, “Uh!!” and that like– blushing so hard.\nAnd then, um, the couple are like, “Oh, look what you\u0026rsquo;ve done! You\u0026rsquo;ve– you– you can\u0026rsquo;t speak this rudely to the village witch!” Uh, but they clearly look like they are enjoying this.\nAnd then the kid is like, “What?! I\u0026rsquo;m just curious!”\nAnd then, um, like more kids stream into the tent, and then, you know, their parents are like, “Close the tent flap! It\u0026rsquo;s too cold!”\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Is the village witch here? I heard–” and then, like, it just becomes– uh, very loud, uh, and, um, festive inside this tent, as all the kids– and, really, the parents as well– dogpile Ginkgo to find out what is happening, um, and what is this development in her relationship with Ephedra.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s pull our last card of winter. Reversed ten of pentacles. So pentacles are around the village and ten is, “You walk through some of the village shops. Which is your favourite, and why?” I love ending on such a mundane note. That\u0026rsquo;s so wonderful.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s the dead of winter. The first thought would be the place where the weaver sells their stuff, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s that. I think it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s a little cafe slash bakery that hosts a lot of the, like, communal gatherings in the evening. You know, it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s just sort of a standard place to hang out and eat and do whatever during the day, but at night it becomes just a community space where a lot of these winter gatherings are held.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m working on an embroidery. Somebody is about to have a baby and I\u0026rsquo;m working on an embroidery for the nursery. It\u0026rsquo;s just very simple, and it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most requested charms from parents, which is just… a sleep aid.\nAnd so often, I think, even– even in– even at home, my first home, and even the other places where I\u0026rsquo;ve lived, I\u0026rsquo;ve done all of my work at home, by myself. And the thing we see here is, like, I bring my thread and my fabric, and I say hello to all the people in the cafe. I see someone trip and pick them up and pull a little magic bandaid out of my pocket and smile and slap it on their knee and they hug me and run off. And I grab a baked good and i chat with the baker, you know– they thank me for the the warmth charm that I gave them on their apron that just helps the bread proof a little bit faster, even in the dead of winter. And I sit and work on this embroidery. And there are just– people walk by and we talk and some of them thank me for things that I\u0026rsquo;ve done for them, but a lot of them just say hi and talk to me as a friend.\nAnd I get chided a little bit for working but I mention that it\u0026rsquo;s for so-and-so\u0026rsquo;s upcoming baby and they relent, rolling their eyes, like, “Of course. Well you can always find something that has to be done, can\u0026rsquo;t you?” and I laugh kind of guiltily and they smile to show that they don\u0026rsquo;t mean it and it\u0026rsquo;s okay, especially because it\u0026rsquo;s in the daytime– they might frown on it if I was working in the middle of the night, but, you know, things do still have to get done during our time of rest. We are still living in a society.\nAnd yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s sort of the– the final image of– of this section here, is just like working, and part of a community. The baker hands me a little bundle of stuff to give to the lighthouse keeper because they know that I visit her all the time.\nRHIANNON: Probably the final card and it is the five of cups. This one doesn\u0026rsquo;t really fit with the season or situation– “It’s time to bury your herb patch”– I am going to draw another card.\nThe sun. “You\u0026rsquo;re celebrating, either something personal or with the village. What is the celebration for?”\nI think as we draw closer to the end of winter, maybe the village has, like, some kind of celebration for, like, the first thaw of the year, right? The first time the snow accumulated over the course of the winter actually melts. And you know it\u0026rsquo;s not quite spring yet but it\u0026rsquo;s starting to get towards it.\nAnd uh, yeah, I think in this case, Viv– you know, she\u0026rsquo;s also celebrating the fact that she, like, has started to feel like she fits here, right? Like– like she has something to do here, and people she\u0026rsquo;s made a connection with, and like, she\u0026rsquo;s– she\u0026rsquo;s celebrating that she\u0026rsquo;s even been here long enough to see this sort of, like, celebration of the first thaw. So I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a note that we can close on.\nSATAH: And… that\u0026rsquo;s it! That\u0026rsquo;s winter.\nAGATHA: And, uh, I think that\u0026rsquo;s where I will end the winter season, and, um, and the game as well. So I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go to the ending.\nRHIANNON: “It\u0026rsquo;s been a whole year since you started your journey.”\nAGATHA: “It\u0026rsquo;s time to settle in and make a place your home.”\nSATAH: “Where do you settle?”\nAGATHA: “What have you learned over the year?”\nALL THREE: “What do you miss?”\nRHIANNON: “What makes you excited about the future?”\nSATAH: “Have you found what you desired?”\nLucky me! Moving sucks! The place where I settle is this place at the seashore. I think, you know, if– if I\u0026rsquo;m allowed to montage a little bit– like, as things thaw in the spring, Connie moves up, and… they move into the stone cabin right beside me, and we spend most of the time sleeping at one or the other\u0026rsquo;s homes. And I– when I\u0026rsquo;m not sleeping at– at Connie\u0026rsquo;s place or my place, I\u0026rsquo;m at the lighthouse. Connie keeps traveling, but this is– this is their new home base.\nRHIANNON: Yeah I think she is going to stay in this mountain village. I think the big thing she\u0026rsquo;s learned is that… she\u0026rsquo;s gotten better at just kind of, like, sitting with things, right? And letting herself be in a place, and not feeling like, uh, she\u0026rsquo;s failing all over again every second that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have her shit figured out. And she\u0026rsquo;s enjoying just being able to be there in that house, overlooking the mountain village, and go through one day and the next. Yeah I think that\u0026rsquo;s gonna be the ending for her.\nAGATHA: Ginkgo and Ephedra date. But I think when the winter season ends, she actually tells Ephedra that she wants to move on to the next village. Which is kind of devastating, uh, to Ephedra. And also to the village, who thought something else was going to happen, which was that she was going to marry Ephedra and then just settle in this village.\nUm, but she explains to him that she– she feels like her journey, uh, to learn how to be a proper village witch has not ended, and she wants to see more and to learn more, and that… she wants– she will return, but she needs to keep going with her journey before she can be sure, or before she can feel like she\u0026rsquo;s ready to basically settle down.\nAnd, um, I think after that, they, uh– they don\u0026rsquo;t talk for a bit, because he just– he\u0026rsquo;s pretty upset, um. Well, I think they don\u0026rsquo;t talk for a bit, and then eventually, uh, he does go to her to, like, talk, and he talks about his… basically his insecurities. Like, she\u0026rsquo;s going to leave, and she\u0026rsquo;s going to meet so many more people in all these different villages that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know, and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know if she\u0026rsquo;ll even want to come back.\nAnd she… well, she apologizes and she says, “Yeah. I can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee it. I– I will– I will keep my heart for you, but I– I guess I… I don\u0026rsquo;t want to change. And I do want to come back. And that is the guarantee that I can give you. But you\u0026rsquo;re right in that things might happen. I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to happen, but…” and I think eventually, um– I mean, he can\u0026rsquo;t stop her. No one can. And like the village is not– is pretty hurt over as well, um, but she does end up leaving, and she goes to other villages.\nAnd what she\u0026rsquo;s learned over the year is that the world is very big. And that there is always so much more to learn, and that people everywhere have so much wisdom that she can learn from and draw from. But she also has learned that people are similar, no matter where they are. There are things that they want, things that they wish they could have. They care about each other and that is something comforting for her.\nSATAH: “What have I learned over the years? Over the year. What have I learned over the year?” Well, shit, a lot, right? Uhh, I guess I… how to connect with people. How to set expectations, and also how to put yourself in situations where you don\u0026rsquo;t have to explain quite as much of yourself, because you\u0026rsquo;re with people who understand you, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know everything about you.\nAnd, well, apparently, how to talk to ghosts. Which… I only related- like, belatedly, realised is unusual. So that\u0026rsquo;s exciting.\nAGATHA: Um, as she goes away the thing that she misses, um– I think she misses home. She does. And maybe in her next year, her journey, she– she does get to go back to visit briefly. And then she realises that things have changed, or maybe she has changed, and maybe what she misses is the times before, more than necessarily, uh, the people.\nSATAH: I think that there is a part of Duck that has a little bit of– of nerve– like feels, feels some nerves about the idea of settling down. Like, kind of liked the idea that they might like just kind of keep hopping forward. But like, not necessarily in a good way, you know? You know, like– you know, you have people like Connie, who genuinely do want to just travel and have those new experiences. And Duck isn\u0026rsquo;t like that. Duck wants one place, but I think they\u0026rsquo;re– they\u0026rsquo;re scared of making the wrong decision. You know, they love getting prepared for stuff and they\u0026rsquo;re not quite as good at accepting that they\u0026rsquo;ve done what they can. And so they miss– they miss being a little less committed, but it\u0026rsquo;s much more fulfilling to be settling in, to– to know where they\u0026rsquo;re going to be for at least the next little while.\nAnd they continue to miss their home and everything, but now they\u0026rsquo;re in a place, and also Connie is traveling so much that like they can send letters with Connie and Connie\u0026rsquo;s constantly coming back from market with people. Like, saying, “Look who I ran into!”\nAnd Duck\u0026rsquo;s childhood best friend tumbles out of the carriage and screams and runs over to them and is just like, “I was selling my clay pots at the thing and then Connie said– that– bkdfgdkfh!”\nAnd so… it\u0026rsquo;s great, you know? People are coming to me! Um, which is also what makes me excited about the future. This is so full of potential and it feels real. It feels good. And…\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got these two people who I love, who are very different. The lighthouse keeper barely leaves the lighthouse, you know, and Connie always wants to go out, go to the markets, and adventure. I\u0026rsquo;ve got these two people who are giving me these two wonderful different perspectives on my life and their lives, and, and teaching me things that I need to achieve that perfect balance for myself.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m excited for work to begin again. Not that– not that I really stopped working. Duck doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop working and there are always things to be done, but they\u0026rsquo;re excited for spring for the first time! Like this is a place where, sure, there\u0026rsquo;s work to be done in fall, and there\u0026rsquo;s always work to be done in spring no matter where you are, but this is a place where like they are going to be BUSY.\nThe weaver is going to teach them how to work with, like, nets and that kind of thing, and how to work better with these aquatic plant fibers, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to learn how to channel more power into them.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and talk to every ghost in the lighthouse. Because I feel like lighthouses just are fucking haunted, you know? Like– like, densely haunted. The lighthouse keeper is, like, a little bit convinced that every single lighthouse keeper is in the lighthouse, it\u0026rsquo;s just that only one of them, like, pops up regularly, because, you know, she\u0026rsquo;s got letters to send to her– her lover. Um. And I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– I feel like seaside towns just feel haunted as shit, you know. So learning that I have a connection with the dead I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Yup, this is a place to be. I\u0026rsquo;m going to investigate all of these. I\u0026rsquo;m going to touch every single big feeling that\u0026rsquo;s ever happened in this town, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to figure it out.”\nAnd it just feels good. It feels right. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to be here.\nAGATHA: What makes her excited about the future is, uh, going back to visit the villages that she\u0026rsquo;s been to already. And then also going back to Ephedra. I think she misses him a lot, too.\nAnd I think she has found what she\u0026rsquo;s desired, which is her place in the world, and who she shall be.\nAnd that closes this chapter of Ginkgo\u0026rsquo;s life.\nSATAH: “Have you found what you desired?” … Yes. And I think that a huge part of that is that I just started on this journey not knowing what I wanted, and I was very lucky that I kept stumbling into things that taught me that, and taught me how to want, and– and how to find things that feel better for me. And so now, with the benefit of hindsight, I\u0026rsquo;m able to name the things that I wanted, and the things that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want. And in reflecting on that, I am able to take the time to create a vision of my future that I can work towards on purpose, for kind of the first time, after really stumbling through life for a really long time. And that\u0026rsquo;s really special and wonderful.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where we\u0026rsquo;re going to leave Duck: with their partners and their ghosts and their sewing, in their little community by the seaside.

I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you a little bit more about them between planets at the break.\nAlone Among the Stars is inarguably one of the most influential solo games of all time, even just looking at the number of how many hacks it\u0026rsquo;s spawned. The very first game on the show, Michael Klamerus\u0026rsquo; Accomplice, is one of those hacks, and I feel safe assuming there will be dozens more in our future because it really has just been that inspiring to that many people. Playing it, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to see why.\nIn Alone Among the Stars, you are traversing through space and landing on planets to see what you find there. At every planet, you lay out a die roll\u0026rsquo;s worth of standard playing cards, and those serves as prompts for what you find. The suits are types of discoveries, like plants or ruins, and the values are locations, such as on a glacier or deep underground. The only other mechanic really is a die roll that determines how difficult something is to find. These three simple pieces of information combine so elegantly and evocatively, it is no wonder that it\u0026rsquo;s inspired as many other games as it has.\nI will note there isn\u0026rsquo;t a unanimous interpretation between the three players here of how to use that die roll– of how difficult something was to find– but no matter where it\u0026rsquo;s employed, it always adds something to the story, which is exactly what, in my opinion as a certified Tables Freak, a rollable table should do.\nWith that, finish your checks, strap in, take a deep breath. We\u0026rsquo;re launching in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, liftoff.\nGAME: PLANET ONE JESS: Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s do some space travel!\nDUSTY: Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the final frontier, which is space. Allegedly.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s go to space! [Laughs]\nDUSTY: Even though we\u0026rsquo;re traveling through stars, so is space truly the final frontier, or is it just a step along the way?\nJESS: I actually really love solo space travel stories. I… for a long time I\u0026rsquo;ve done these, like, midnight Twitter threads about, like, a solo space explorer in first person and I– I don\u0026rsquo;t usually comment on them, especially during the day. I just, like– they’re just a little secret surprise for people up at that time. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s now a secret between you and me, listener, but. Yeah! So it\u0026rsquo;s a very familiar setting to me, so I\u0026rsquo;m really excited.\nDUSTY: This is actually maybe my first experience doing a solo game like this. I\u0026rsquo;m very adept at just talking and such, so it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be too hard. I\u0026rsquo;m very excited. I love sci-fi stories, space stories, and the idea of just getting to explore planets is truly just lovely and fascinating for me.\nJESS: I\u0026rsquo;ve played ALONE AMONG THE DERELICTS, which is a hack of Alone Among the Stars about exploring derelict spaceships by CLAYMORE, the person who made FIST. It\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic game. But I\u0026rsquo;ve never played Alone Among the Stars itself, which is really funny considering how into solo space exploration I am as a general concept. But that just means I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to play it here.\nSATAH: The first time I played Alone Among the Stars, I played the two-player version, Together Among the Stars with a friend as a… prequel? Uh… we were playing a game of galactic, and we were all very into our game of galactic, and so we had a bunch of spin-off games with different groups of people, and a friend and I did a prequel game in Together Among the Stars as… oh, ah, probably… spacefaring… probably had to do with the space between. But that memory is somewhat lost to time, which feels fitting, in many ways. [Cards being shuffled]\nDUSTY: I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought too much about this.\nSATAH: I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought very much about the circumstances of my journey.\nJESS: I haven\u0026rsquo;t really decided who I am and what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, because the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have you do that up front.\nSATAH: Which is somewhat unusual for me. I like to sort of have a grounding of a character with a goal or a group that they\u0026rsquo;re working for, but I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna try and hop into it the way that the game presents itself, and I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to see how it plays.\nDUSTY: I imagine I\u0026rsquo;m just a solo space, um… not hitchhiker, because I have my own vehicle, but like a space nomad, like a cowboy drifting around the plains, except the plains are different planets. That kind of deal.\nJESS: I\u0026rsquo;m very tempted to go with my usual solo space explorer on some sort of civil exploration mission, kind of like Star Trek The Next Generation, but what if you were alone and kind of melancholy, but I\u0026rsquo;m gonna see where the random takes me, and we\u0026rsquo;ll figure out if I fall back into that comfort zone.\nSo 1d6. [Die clattering] Two. Okay, two things on my starting planet, which means… oh yes, cards. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna need cards. So. [Cards being shuffled] We\u0026rsquo;re gonna deal two cards face down.\nDUSTY: So I\u0026rsquo;m rolling the dice. Two. Two cards are gonna describe what I find.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] So our first planet has one thing to discover.\nJESS: And to discover something, I roll a six-sided die to figure out how I discovered it, and then flip the card. Okay, here we go. [Die rolling] That is a three. I come upon it suddenly, and it is… a three of clubs. “Plants and other immobile forms of life” “by a gentle river.”\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really interesting to me immediately that I come upon something so seemingly gentle so suddenly, right? Like it\u0026rsquo;s a calm, natural environment, it\u0026rsquo;s a plant, but I come upon it very, very suddenly. And I think I want that to… be more about the thing itself than about how I come upon this river. So for whatever reason, I\u0026rsquo;m here, I\u0026rsquo;m following this river maybe. I\u0026rsquo;m already picturing at the very least a scientist, someone whose goal is to catalog and- and collect and get information on these planets. And so I\u0026rsquo;m going along this river looking for sea life, wildlife, vegetation, everything, you know?\nAnd I– at one moment… [Gasp of realisation] it\u0026rsquo;s an algae bloom. That\u0026rsquo;s what it is. It\u0026rsquo;s like a very… I have no idea how fast an algae bloom is in real life. That could be something that takes a season, for all I know, but on this particular planet, it happens very quickly.\nAnd so I\u0026rsquo;m here at this gentle river– like I would say, even, I\u0026rsquo;m sitting down taking notes and just documenting the smallest little life forms. And then [Soft explosive sound] we just see like red bloom and run down this river faster than the current itself, turning the blue red. And it just continues to flow like that– little, like, bits of algae sort of moving around, giving the whole thing this reddish tint. And I put down my notebook and I\u0026rsquo;m just stunned for the moment.\nIt is a physical notebook, despite being a space traveler. Maybe- maybe I\u0026rsquo;m nostalgic in that way. And I have to go back to my ship and dictate it all into an electronic system to transmit back to whoever has sent me on this mission. But I think when I\u0026rsquo;m in the field, when I can, when I can sit down and watch the algae bloom, it\u0026rsquo;s a physical notebook that I calmly set beside myself and just sort of watch the aftermath and the flowing algae.\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a nice start. There we go.\nSATAH: Rolled a five, so I spotted it while I\u0026rsquo;m resting. That card is a four of hearts. Hearts are “ruins: mysterious obelisks, vine covered temples, abandoned dwellings for people bigger than you, a wrecked spaceship, et cetera.” And a four is “in a steep canyon.”\nAlright. So while I\u0026rsquo;m resting on this very first planet, I spy a ruin of some kind in a canyon.\nSo I think I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to make this an origin story. Like, this is the planet that I live on and I\u0026rsquo;m doing some sort of job… just, just doing like day labour? And I go on my lunch break and I\u0026rsquo;m chilling by this canyon because the temperature is much cooler over there. And I go a little bit further in than anyone else because I just need a break from all the people and the noise.\nAnd I see… a crashed spaceship. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go exactly with one of the examples that they give of a wrecked spaceship. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s big. It\u0026rsquo;s like a… no, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s not that it\u0026rsquo;s big. It\u0026rsquo;s just, it\u0026rsquo;s a ship that doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like anything I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. And I think space travel is fairly normalized in this world, but to the– that– in– to the extent that it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s like a commuting thing. You know, it\u0026rsquo;s like, if you were just used to seeing a bus all the time and then you saw a tank for the first time and you were like, “What the fuck is that used for? It has the shape of some things that I understand. It\u0026rsquo;s got wheels. There\u0026rsquo;s a place inside for a person, obviously. But I don\u0026rsquo;t understand how it possibly relates to the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with.”\nAnd so I see this wrecked spaceship in this canyon. And I think because it\u0026rsquo;s a ruin, it\u0026rsquo;s old. Yeah, there\u0026rsquo;s, there\u0026rsquo;s like… fauna have started to nest in it and that kind of thing.\nAnd I am scrambling down this- this- this cliff side and I am investigating it and just like– it\u0026rsquo;s like something just snaps in me that I\u0026rsquo;m like, all of a sudden, very aware of how big the universe is. And that I have been living my life on this planet, taking random jobs, just sort of getting along. And seeing this ship starts to wake me up.\nI think the thing that really instigates me is that I go to share this with some of my team, like my coworkers, and I\u0026rsquo;m probably, I\u0026rsquo;m probably– friendly people. Like I work with them fairly regularly and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “There\u0026rsquo;s a big crazy ship down there. Y\u0026rsquo;all want to go see?” And they just have like, a lack of curiosity.\nSome of them have a lack of curiosity. Some of them have a smugness that’s kind of like a, “Okay, so there\u0026rsquo;s a ship? Like, you\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a ship before?” or whatever. And I realise that I am alone in this incredible feeling that I\u0026rsquo;m having that the universe is so big and that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so little of it.\nAnd so I start my journey!\nI think… I get the ship- I get the wrecked ship hauled to like a garage and– I\u0026rsquo;m not going to fly off in it, but I do think that it deserves to be, like, repaired and investigated. And talking with the person at the garage, they\u0026rsquo;re like, “Oh my god, I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen anything like this in so long. This looks like the first generation of this type of ship.”\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re talking about it and I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Yeah, you should keep learning more about that. I need to go and see where this could have come from.”\nAnd they… give me… they manage to extract some navigational data logs from it that are, like, super corrupted and not very helpful, but they do indicate places where the ship may have landed at some points, or at least areas of the galaxy that it spent some time in. And so I\u0026rsquo;m going to go and investigate some of those places and see what I can find and what drew this person here. Or just work backwards like, “Hey, this person ended up here. Maybe if I work backwards, I will want to end up here as well.” You know?\nDUSTY: [Die rolling] So on the three or a four for this game, I come upon this planet suddenly. I think what this is, is… I kind of like this idea that I\u0026rsquo;m, like, a traveling, like, space cowboy, essentially. Yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s go space cowboy. What does that mean? That just kind of means I\u0026rsquo;m a wanderer, a person with no home. And maybe I\u0026rsquo;m flying through a sector that either has no, uh, like official maps or coordinates or logging about it. Or even more mysterious, like, I\u0026rsquo;m coming upon a planet that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there according to all the logs and maps.\nAnd I feel like the ship I have is something that used to be a more professional, maybe corporate-esque ship. And now it\u0026rsquo;s getting converted to essentially like an RV.\nAnd so I come upon this planet and I need to find out what\u0026rsquo;s here since it\u0026rsquo;s not logged, it\u0026rsquo;s not tracked anywhere. Let\u0026rsquo;s see.\n[Card flipping] So my first discovery as I descend onto this planet is ten of clubs. So the clubs stand for “plants and other immobile forms of life” and ten is “on a cliff face”.\nHow I think this comes upon is that I\u0026rsquo;m descending and… I see what from above may look like a lush, like– a mesa, but incredibly lush with life. And when I land, I land below it just so I could see a bit better its shading from whatever source of light this planet provides, sun, two suns, three suns you could say.\nAnd I realized that the cliff face and this mesa is actually all organic. It\u0026rsquo;s all trees, all bush, it\u0026rsquo;s all vines that have grown as the thickness of tree trunks.\nAnd I walk up to it and see that there is even more just bristling life beneath it. All these weird insects, these weird, like, mushrooms that are, like, floating off from these vines, these trees, leaves.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m trying to grab onto it to see if I could climb and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t give way, but even though these look like normal vines and such, it feels strange to put hands on it because there\u0026rsquo;s some kind of buzzing, vibrating deal with it.\nI think I get onto my ship and try to go to the top and as I\u0026rsquo;m descending, like flying over it from like a lower height– um, there\u0026rsquo;s a word for it, but– I\u0026rsquo;m looking below and not only is the mesa part– like the top of it, also, it looks like a canopy, but there\u0026rsquo;s definitely things moving, whether it be the trees itself or the– there\u0026rsquo;s something in it, but the top of this seems to be pure canopy. Maybe that would not even be easy to land on.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s both excitement, but also fear, because what does that even mean? So I think I will keep flying on my ship, low to the ground. And seeing that perhaps like this is kind of a spot of concentrated life, concentrated trees, vegetation, and that it\u0026rsquo;s more like the rest of the plains and such are perhaps more rocky, more mountainous.\nJESS: So second card, let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and roll 1d6. [Die rolling] That\u0026rsquo;s a four. I also come upon it suddenly. I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing revelation.\nThat is an ace of diamonds. That seems like an auspicious one. That\u0026rsquo;s not an ace of diamonds. That\u0026rsquo;s an ace of spades. That feels auspicious, also, in different ways. Um, so spades are “natural phenomena.” Examples given include “huge crystal rock formations–” [Correcting herself] “Crystal formations.” Crystal, rock, similar. “Mirages, vividly colored lightning, et cetera.” And an ace is “in a field taller than me.”\nWhat does it mean for a field to be taller than me? Are we talking about like a field of crops and, like, the corn is above my head? Or, you know, what if I interpret this very generously, very sci-fi-y, very Star Trek and Stargatey as I am wont to and say whatever this natural phenomena is, it expresses itself as a field. An energy field, a cloud, whatever. Um, and it\u0026rsquo;s taller than me and I come upon it suddenly. Interesting.\nSo maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the same day that I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced this algae bloom. And I\u0026rsquo;m heading back to the ship to do that cataloging that I– that- that data entry that I have to do because I use my notebook. And I\u0026rsquo;m retreading ground that I\u0026rsquo;ve already been on. And so I\u0026rsquo;m not really paying as much attention. I\u0026rsquo;m distracted and in my own thoughts. I might as well already be back on the ship mentally.\nAnd so I hardly notice the first little signs that this is happening, the changes in the air. If I had been paying attention, there would have been some more warning signs, a electrostatic hum, some crackling in the air. And then, just like the algae, but this time the, like… blue-black of dusk splitting into this electric blue as little, like, bolts of- of lightning, like as if it might be arcing down from the sky, but it\u0026rsquo;s connecting between points that are just in a field around me. Just these tiny– almost as if the air was- was static shocking itself. And it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s all around me.\nAnd I look up because I\u0026rsquo;m staring like– eyes seeing through the ground in front of me, just watching my step as I- as I\u0026rsquo;m elsewhere. And then one of those shocks hits my suit. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a fully helmeted suit on, just being careful. I don\u0026rsquo;t really know exactly how habitable this planet is for humans. And it zaps my suit and I\u0026rsquo;m stunned. And then I look up and I see this, like, localized miniature lightning storm that is reaching up into the, like, sky above me. It is not just taller than me, but like, I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine I could climb out of it, even if there was somewhere to climb on this open plane.\nAnd so I have a moment of just once again being wowed. I signed up for a mission like this in part because I love this sort of phenomena. I love taking it in and be– letting myself be amazed. And then it hits my suit again. And I get the first little, like, warning alarm about, like, an electric overload in one of the circuits. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, “Okay! I do not know enough about the safety of this place to be without a functioning suit.”\nAnd I start to, like, pick up the pace a little bit and see if there\u0026rsquo;s like an– if the edges of the field are anywhere nearby? But it\u0026rsquo;s taller and wider than me, and so it turns from like a quick walk to a sprint as there keep being these little zaps. And it\u0026rsquo;s not painful, but I just– I\u0026rsquo;m so worried that any one of them could be what, like, shorts my suit.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m bolting, running. And then just as suddenly as it came, it\u0026rsquo;s gone. There\u0026rsquo;s just no storm anymore. And I just stop. That\u0026rsquo;s so cool and surprising in and of itself. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like this little gentle prodding not to be lost in my own thoughts. And I calm my breathing and I still keep a brisk pace, now, because who knows, that could happen again. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what caused it. And I\u0026rsquo;d rather be back on my ship and maybe get my ship out of here. Do my data entry in orbit before it gets hit by an electrical storm. But… I still– I think I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I was in it. It was so cool and I wish I could stay to study exactly why that happens here.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not my job. I come, I catalog. I note what I can in the time that I\u0026rsquo;m here and I move on. So I climb into my cockpit, slide it forward, lock and latch and take off. And as I\u0026rsquo;m flying away, I look down and I see a bunch of little localized pockets of those– those storms. This was not an isolated incident.\nAnd I think maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to Orion 6 and try and figure out what was happening here.\nDUSTY: [Card flipping] Interesting. This next one is the king of diamonds. So diamond is more about living beings and maybe similar to what I found. And kings, I find “floating in the air.” That\u0026rsquo;s really interesting.\nI think as I\u0026rsquo;m flying away from this kind of mesa of trees and organic life and such like that, I am coming upon, uh… kind of almost like the reverse of what I just found, where it seems to be, instead of a mesa starting from the ground, I see there\u0026rsquo;s this formation of stone, like, but it\u0026rsquo;s now floating in the air, almost like a castle in the sky kind of motif. Like, with green vegetation, almost going down to the ground. Just barely, almost as if it\u0026rsquo;s like a rope ladder, but it\u0026rsquo;s just a thin line connecting that to this thing, which, like, is now hundreds of feet in the air.\nAnd as I go to get closer, I see that… this is even stranger to perceive. It’s almost where the rock ends and meets the air is actually filled with water. It\u0026rsquo;s this, like, dome of water that is above this floating rock. And I blink a couple times just to confirm what I\u0026rsquo;m seeing. Not that it\u0026rsquo;s the strangest thing I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in my travels, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely abnormal.\nAnd as I get closer, I see that there are… fish-like beings, fish-like animals, maybe sentient creatures, kind of getting almost to the edge of the water. And the water is holding it in. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be moving or rippling from the outside. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s in the actual dome. Perhaps there\u0026rsquo;s some kind of technology or some kind of something more mystical holding it in place that\u0026rsquo;s hard to understand or comprehend. And these creatures that look like between, um… sharks that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on other planets, just longer fish, some like mammalian whales and stuff.\nIt seems to be, like, aquariums, which is something that in my travels I haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced in person, just from the planets I’ve been to, but I’ve heard stories, I’ve seen videos, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard all these tales of aquariums where people would gather fish to be seen in the museum, except this seems to be a place.\nAnd whether this globe of water is there to protect them from below, or below is vice versa, which is why it\u0026rsquo;s been set up this high, hard to say.\nAnd as I get closer, I see that a lot of these fish and such are starting to converge close to where my ship is kind of floating, you know, a hundred feet away to keep distance. And I see something bigger behind them, huge, starting to fly through it. And I think that spooks me. And I set the ship for a course to go back into space, as I don\u0026rsquo;t want to learn what that was, or if it had ill intentions towards me as I was encroaching on its land.\nWhen I leave a planet, I believe I give it a name. Is that correct? “Each time you complete a planet, give it a number or a name and find a new planet.” I did not experience as much as this planet to give it a good name, but… I… maybe let\u0026rsquo;s call it XT, like, for “cross terrain” or something like that. That\u0026rsquo;s what I will put down in my notes or my logs for myself.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I put these cards back, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and roll for my next planet.\nBREAK SATAH: The gods of randomness decided that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hear from me very much in this episode, which makes me very grateful to have two incredible guests to, you know, make the show for me.\nJess Levine is a designer of award-winning TTRPGs, musician, and sci-fi author with work in Clarkesworld and also in a recent anthology you should pick up, either physically or digitally, Embodied Exegesis: Transfeminine Cyberpunk Futures. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the pleasure of editing a bunch of Jess\u0026rsquo; work and there are simply few people who are as satisfying to have deep-diving, big and small picture, joyfully nitpicking conversations about game philosophy and the utility of authorial voice with.

It\u0026rsquo;s really out of control.\nDusty is a game designer, producer, and podcaster-about-town. Their gentle enthusiasm during the process of putting these episodes together has been hugely uplifting to me and I am so excited to direct you towards their games work, which spans an impressive array of genres and includes such evocative titles as Lesbian Werewolf Crime Fighters, Trans Vampire Cowboys, and Dracula Owes You Money.

Thank you! You can find more of my work at gaygothvibes.online, which will direct you to some TTRPGs I\u0026rsquo;ve made and also to some music that I\u0026rsquo;ve made, including the EP I released on the last day of 2024, it’s really only, which I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered is a wonderful way to spend about 10 minutes a little worried about me! [Laughing] It is– I think it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good. I think it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good. It is sad. What are you gonna do? You know? You gotta, you gotta write the stuff. What?\nUh, there\u0026rsquo;s a segue brewing. What is it? So, I was just talking about how the music was sad, and it\u0026rsquo;s something about, like, sadness being based on, uh, something about Earth, living here being difficult. So let\u0026rsquo;s instead be in space. By getting back to the game.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not gonna workshop that segue any further. That\u0026rsquo;s the final draft. That\u0026rsquo;s the final draft of that segue and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna stand by it.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get back to Alone Among the Stars. My god.\nGAME: PLANET TWO JESS: Here we go. Planet two. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how many things we\u0026rsquo;re gonna find. [Die rolling] Six! Okay. Busy planet this time. [Six cards being dealt]\nSATAH: So, planet two. [Die clattering] Oh my goodness. Another one.\nDUSTY: Oh, okay! So this one has four. So four cards for my next discovery.\nJESS: And we roll a die and we come upon the first one. It\u0026rsquo;s arduous to get to. So it\u0026rsquo;s not sudden this time.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find out what\u0026rsquo;s arduous to get to. That is a king of clubs. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got more “plants and immobile forms of life.” So maybe my character specializes in botany? Or it\u0026rsquo;s just what\u0026rsquo;s standing out. But I think maybe, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s her specialization. But you know, you have to be somewhat of a generalist if you\u0026rsquo;re gonna pilot a spacecraft alone and then catalog a whole new planet, right?\nSo king of clubs. Oh, “plant or immobile life” “floating in the air.”\nOkay. So I\u0026rsquo;m immediately fascinated by “immobile” and “floating in the air.” But I think the explanation that I like is actually a very mundane one. Because I would say that dandelions are an immobile form of life that float in the air. They move, but they\u0026rsquo;re not moving themselves, you know? The wind carries them. And so…\nOkay, okay. What if we combine this? Space jellyfish. But on a planet. But in space, because I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten there through space. It\u0026rsquo;s space to me. It\u0026rsquo;s space to my character.\nSo. This planet has lower gravity than my home planet and than the earth that you and I know. And there are these plants that– their natural, like, life cycle reaction, like their photosynthesis and whatever has a gaseous byproduct that is lighter than air on this planet. And it fills an internal chamber with this gaseous byproduct, causing it to float into the air and sit there at basically neutral buoyancy. Like, once it matures, the mature ones just hang there, and the other ones are, like, growing out of the ground. And they– I\u0026rsquo;m becoming so fascinated by the biology of this plant. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, we\u0026rsquo;ll get back to my character\u0026rsquo;s place in it, but I love these plants. Um. And so as they mature, they eventually produce enough of the gas in that inner chamber to pull off of the roots that hold them to the ground. And then they float there until the plant begins to die, and then it sinks back to the ground.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s “arduous to get to.” I think the important part about that detail is that it justifies me staying there to get all of the information that I\u0026rsquo;ve just given you. It\u0026rsquo;s like, okay, well, I had to, like, free climb up a cliff and then go down into this ravine and then cross through, blah de blah de blah de blah. I am far from my ship. It\u0026rsquo;s not going to make sense to go back to my ship tonight and sleep there and then, you know, move my ship like I usually do. This justifies camping.\nAnd I brought along camping supplies, both because it\u0026rsquo;s good safety, and then also because I was kind of hoping that something would justify a little camp out and getting to go in, like, deep on something. That\u0026rsquo;s something I don\u0026rsquo;t get to do a lot.\nAnd so I come upon these floating plants and of course I am fascinated. Like what is this? And I want to know how it works, and… I\u0026rsquo;m not going to get all the details; I probably don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly the cause of the off-gassing and all of that, but like I get to stay through the night. And in that time, I get to see a few of those plants mature. Just be there in the moment that they, boop, and the like little pitcher plant expands enough and then pops up into the air. And watch some of them die. Watch that whole sort of cycle happen. And I’m– I\u0026rsquo;ve got guesses on why and on how. I\u0026rsquo;m writing them down in my little notebook. And I\u0026rsquo;m fascinated. I wish I could stay, but one night of camping is I think all I could justify. There\u0026rsquo;s probably someone who reads my mission logs and is like, “Hey, you gotta– you gotta move on. We\u0026rsquo;re not paying you–” Are we paying? Is there pay? Are we in a Star Trek post-capitalist utopia… asterisk… failures of the imagination… we\u0026rsquo;re moving on.\nOkay, so.\nDUSTY: So, two. A one or two is that\u0026rsquo;s arduous to get to. I think how this looks is that my journey from that planet made me curious as to what other planets are missing. I think being that I said this is kind of, like, more corporate, maybe I worked at a place where I have logs of just all the sectors of known universe that we\u0026rsquo;re able to travel to. And I search and dig deeper as my ship has plotted course just towards, you know… away from the planet towards a random destination.\nAnd I see… I see a log about information that was cited only in passing where it was… a planet that was seen across a dangerous asteroid field. It seems that\u0026rsquo;s the only way to get to it from where they were. Almost as if it was like a ring of Saturn, but more heavier, and the planet seems to be smaller.\nAnd feeling brave… or stupid, or determined… I decide to go check it out. It\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a journey for sure. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I get through it with my ship unscathed. Perhaps it got some chip damage along the way. Not enough to have me stuck; at least that\u0026rsquo;s what I think. But I get through and I appear upon this planet.\nAnd for it to be seen or noticed through this asteroid field, it\u0026rsquo;s like bright, bright, like, primary colour. It\u0026rsquo;s like a blue- blue planet, but different blue than like what you\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Earth or something like that.\nBut, uh, let\u0026rsquo;s, let\u0026rsquo;s do our first discovery. [Card flipping] Okay, okay, okay. So we\u0026rsquo;re back to the club. So, more “plants are other immobile forms of life.” This is six, so, six of clubs. So, “on the snowy peak of a mountain.” So that does determine that there\u0026rsquo;s snow here.\nAnd I think how this goes is that I\u0026rsquo;m descending onto this planet and I see that this blue is primarily… both, water, but a lot of the Terra, a lot of the Earth, are actually this deep blue as well.\nAnd there is snow. The snow seems to be just what snow would normally be: crystallized water turning white, kind of falling through the sky. And I see this peak of a mountain, as it\u0026rsquo;s one of the first things that seems to be not only large enough for me to land a ship, but there are structures on it. And as I get closer, it seems that not only is the structure, um, huge, towering over this already– mountain that looks over the rest of this planet, it seems to be old. Incredibly so. I don some cold material, some cold gear to walk through safely.\nAnd I approach these… almost pillars; these titanic growths coming from this mountain. As I get closer, the snow- not falling hard, but falling enough to create crunches under my feet. They must be 50 feet tall. There\u0026rsquo;s multiple of them, kind of forming, like, an arrow pointing towards one that\u0026rsquo;s even larger than the rest. But they do seem to be… tree trunks, old wizened tree trunks, as I get closer. The only way that I could tell is that they have the natural grooves and the rings and the lines of that tree trunk wood. I see no leaves. In fact, almost no branches, but you see some of the bark has uh, peeled off, just naturally. And it\u0026rsquo;s growing in these weird clusters that happens when cells try to reproduce what was there. So it seems to be barely living, and…\nThey\u0026rsquo;re carved with a language I couldn\u0026rsquo;t begin to understand. Or maybe they\u0026rsquo;re just symbols, maybe they\u0026rsquo;re gibberish. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to say. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s here.\nAnd as I get to the center, when I see this one has been primarily stripped of any of its bark, and now it\u0026rsquo;s this dark tan, this dark brown almost of the trunk, but it\u0026rsquo;s blemished with all these carvings, again, of these words, or symbols, or what have you, seemingly all the way up this.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m kind of standing there, trying to determine what this is. And I feel the need to document it but at the same time, I feel like I may be encroaching on some historically or ho– like, religious importance that maybe I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t stay for long. And the cold is not helping either.\nI think I kind of go back to my ship and decide to check out the rest of this planet.\nJESS: Six. Come upon this one as I\u0026rsquo;m resting. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;re not moving on! Maybe this is while I\u0026rsquo;m camping, actually. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out. [Card flipping] Jack of clubs! Clubs! “Life forms, plants, and immobile life forms!” Botanist! Here we go. Jack: “in the desert.” Interesting. Was I already in a desert? Or was that what was arduous to cross? Yeah.\nSo maybe- maybe this area of this planet– we\u0026rsquo;re not doing Star Wars planets that are one biome. Sorry.– this area of this planet is fairly arid and hot, and so… I\u0026rsquo;ve done the trip there, and I knew it was very challenging.\nAnd these little floating plants there, they\u0026rsquo;re actually succulents. They\u0026rsquo;re a strange form of succulent, but. We\u0026rsquo;ve moved on from those ones.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m on my way back to the ship and even in my suit with all of my hydration equipment and all of that, with the suns beating down, it is truly just, like, grueling. And so I take a moment and find, like, a rocky outcropping to hide under and get some shade. And I tuck myself into that outcropping in the middle of this really open desert.\nAnd hiding in the shade… it’s gotta be fungi, right? Yeah. Yeah. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the relationship between fungi and deserts. There\u0026rsquo;s got to be less decay, just because there\u0026rsquo;s less life? But on this planet…\nOkay. So– so meet me here. Oyster fungus. Oh my god, we literally have something called oyster mushrooms in this world. But that\u0026rsquo;s not what I mean. They\u0026rsquo;re like… think of it kind of like filter feeders, but for dead things in the air.\nAnd so, like, again… my character probably can\u0026rsquo;t figure this out, can she? Well, maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a feature on it that lets her have some sense of this. Because they\u0026rsquo;re growing up the, like– they\u0026rsquo;re basically terracing, these mushrooms are terracing this rocky overhang. And they\u0026rsquo;re arranged in such a way that it almost creates this little wind tunnel-like effect between them. And the fungi are very spongy and open and they even have sort of Swiss cheese-esque holes in them.\nAnd so I have some guesses, but if I knew, if I could stay to study them– and maybe I actually sample them because I really am like, why do they grow this way? And I sample them in a little tube.\nAnd the answer is that they… how did I come upon this one? Resting. Yes, I was resting under the overhang. And of course I see fascinating plant life– or- fungus, not technically plants. And I just have to get this little sample and do all of this hypothesizing in my journal that the fact that I think they eat, for some definition of eat, dead cells floating and drifting on the wind. And that\u0026rsquo;s how they survive and grow.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Rolled a two. So it\u0026rsquo;s arduous to get to. That makes sense for the first thing. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what it is. Five of hearts. Another ruin. And five is “in a treetop.”\n[Laughing] This is– maybe this is so silly, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s another ship. Like it’s the same ship. Maybe… hey… maybe this is going to be time travel-y and it is the exact same ship. Maybe right now I am– oh dear, traveling along the timeline of somebody who was on a journey and who died at the end of all of their journeys. They died on several different planets alone.\nYeah, I think there\u0026rsquo;s some sort of unique marking on it that makes me so sure that this is the exact same ship. And maybe there\u0026rsquo;s like an insignia on the inside; I recognize the pilot\u0026rsquo;s name and it\u0026rsquo;s the exact same ship, the exact same pilot. And it crashed here too. It\u0026rsquo;s stuck in this treetop. And it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s– I am like, “Oh, I\u0026rsquo;ve been… there\u0026rsquo;s a time loop happening here. And this person is trying to go somewhere and not escaping over and over again.” Choose your own adventure book where they just keep getting the bad ending over and over.\nBut I think somewhere they have to be alive. Or… maybe I can find the loop and take them out of it. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s my job. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve- that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m here for. This is my destiny, to find this pilot in the middle of this time loop and pull them out before they crash their ship and fly off with them maybe.\n[Explaining some distant thunking noises that happened as they were speaking] Garold is thumping his tail like he maybe doesn\u0026rsquo;t approve of this plan, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s a really good plan, Garold. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think it will go badly.\nJESS: What\u0026rsquo;s next on this planet? Uh, die roll is next actually. Two! “Arduous to get to.” Makes sense. This is an arduous planet. [Card flipping] That is a four of diamonds. We haven\u0026rsquo;t had diamonds yet. “Living beings” “in a steep canyon.” Okay.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ve got- we\u0026rsquo;ve got something alive that moves around and then, based on my own definition previously, of its own volition specifically.\nSo I think, of the many things I had to cross, that included like- like a really narrow, like, ravine or canyon, right? Like, like almost I could bound across it without– just not quite a jump, but I have to have some, like, speed, right, to get one stride. And then it\u0026rsquo;s, like, a hundred meters down. Like it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a little scary, just doing that stride, right?\nAnd this time, I\u0026rsquo;m of course looking down, like how can you not, as I do. And I notice movement and I stop before I, like, take the stride, and I lower myself to the ground to peer out down this incredibly narrow canyon. And there\u0026rsquo;s just this, like, march happening. It\u0026rsquo;s just, like, one after the other. Like– I have no idea why I\u0026rsquo;m imagining it this way, but I\u0026rsquo;m imagining little tree-like guys. I guess I– I\u0026rsquo;m a, I\u0026rsquo;m a biologist. I\u0026rsquo;m a biologist, apparently. Little, like, Sudowoods? For, for Pokemon Gold and Silver fans out there. Um, and they\u0026rsquo;re like waddling back and forth, sort of like penguins, each following each other in this single file line down the ravine. They\u0026rsquo;re just like, you know, a half meter tall at most and just… bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.\nAnd I go, like, as quiet as I can. This is the first life I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on this planet. And also for some reason there\u0026rsquo;s weird tree people in a desert… and I\u0026rsquo;m also not thinking quite like people, people. They\u0026rsquo;re bipedal, but I\u0026rsquo;m not imagining something sentient. I\u0026rsquo;m not ready for her to deal with that yet. She\u0026rsquo;s not ready to deal with that yet, my character.\nUm, and so she\u0026rsquo;s just watching them march down this little ravine and she\u0026rsquo;s so tempted to follow, trying to figure out where they\u0026rsquo;re going. Is it a water source? That\u0026rsquo;s a good bet generally with animal life, especially in a desert. Or do they have some other purpose in mind? They\u0026rsquo;re all– it\u0026rsquo;s a- it\u0026rsquo;s a long procession. Like I\u0026rsquo;m talking, it takes a minute or two from when I first spot them till they reach the end of the line. So it\u0026rsquo;s a whole community on its way somewhere.\nBut I check my watch. I am not lucky enough to get to go in depth. I sketch them. I take a photo, which is what I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to do, and note some of their behavioural patterns. And I bound across. And I don\u0026rsquo;t even think I see as my bound kicks a couple pebbles down the cliff and a few of them peer up, catching just the back of me, and noting me, like, I noted them. And then moving on because they\u0026rsquo;re holding up the line.\nDUSTY: Okay. Okay. So this is eight of spades. So spades are “natural phenomena” and eight is “on a glacier.”\nSo I think this leads me to fly off from this, uh, mountaintop and head down. And as I get lower, the snow seems to be lighter, but I do see, uh, like I only imagine is a tumultuous ocean, for– at least, from the shore. I see waves coming down onto this strange deep blue sand? Dirt? I assume it\u0026rsquo;s sand because that\u0026rsquo;s where the water is meeting and that\u0026rsquo;s just natural, but again, we\u0026rsquo;re on a different planet in a galaxy barely known.\nSo I continue on and I skim the water until I notice that it starts to become sheets of ice. And I see above, this glacier. This huge glacier, almost coming out of the earth like a spike driven into the ground, but reverse. And it\u0026rsquo;s not the earth, it\u0026rsquo;s the ocean.\nAnd as I\u0026rsquo;m getting closer, I– my natural, um, instruments, like for determining where I am, like, scanning stuff, start to kind of fizzle in and out as if there\u0026rsquo;s some kind of interference. Um, not enough to hurt the ship. I\u0026rsquo;m still able to fly in control, just manually. And I decided to use that moment to maybe essentially kind of park the ship in place in the air.\nAnd then I realise that I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked out at the glacier again. And I see that this glacier, kind of poking out, there seems to be this ring of light emanating from it. This ring of mist, of clouds, of snow, but bright and multicoloured, almost as if it was refracting, like a beam of light does to a mirror, and that point across the glacier. Then it tightens and almost becomes just a sphere right on top. And then the whole glacier, which was just stark white across this, begins to glow the same way.\nAnd when it hits that, I think that\u0026rsquo;s when I start getting alarming sounds as it\u0026rsquo;s causing now more interference with all my instruments. Which snaps me out of what I was viewing, the beauty of whatever is happening. And I do think I need to at least move away from it a safer distance, in that- in order not to have my ship more damaged.\nJESS: Okay, card four. [Die rolling] “Arduous to get to.” You know, nothing on this planet is easy.\nSix of clubs! “Plants and immobile form of life.” You heard me shuffle these, listener, but we\u0026rsquo;re going for plants and immobile forms of life. We love biology.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s “on the snowy peak of a mountain.” Yeah, no kidding that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to get to. So we\u0026rsquo;re going from a desert to a snowy peak of a mountain.\nMaybe I’ve– I’ve moved on at this point, and I made it back to my ship and we\u0026rsquo;ve taken off. And like I said, there are multiple biomes on planets and I fly in between them to make observations.\nAnd so the mountain here is so steep, I can\u0026rsquo;t put my ship down anywhere. There\u0026rsquo;s no plateau where it\u0026rsquo;s safe to have, like, you know– it\u0026rsquo;s not just the size of the ship, it is the size of somewhere that I can see and safely bank a landing. And so I put down much nearer to the base of this mountain and then time to head up.\nAny excuse, right? Anything that keeps me out in the field longer.\nAnd so I get to the top of the mountain at the end of this day. Like I put down, very beginning of the day, and get to the top at the end. And when I\u0026rsquo;m reaching the peak…\nI’ve focused so much on the air in this place. And I imagine that there has to be a reason for that. What if there\u0026rsquo;s just, like, a lot of atmosphere here? Like… I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading Kim Stanley Robinson\u0026rsquo;s Mars trilogy recently and they\u0026rsquo;re constantly talking about millibars and adding adding gases to the atmosphere. And I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t have a great understanding of what it would mean to have, like, more and a heavier atmosphere, um, than Earth. But let\u0026rsquo;s say that\u0026rsquo;s happening.\nAnd up at the tip of this mountain, this really tall mountain, is like, finally, the atmosphere is thinning a little bit to something I\u0026rsquo;m more used to. And it\u0026rsquo;s a little easier to, like, move through. And the plants are almost more familiar here.\nAnd specifically, this is where I run into space dandelions! The sort of stuff that maybe is getting filtered out of the air by those fungi. Maybe it drifts down off the mountain. It\u0026rsquo;s– [Gasp of realisation] It\u0026rsquo;s not snow. It\u0026rsquo;s not a snowy peak of a mountain. I thought it was snow. I thought it was snow while passing overhead. But it\u0026rsquo;s not. It\u0026rsquo;s really, really arid here on this planet. And- and snowy peaked mountains are not, like, a common feature. But it looked like that because it is just masses and masses of fields of these little dandelion-esque plants that poof off into the air and throw up massive clouds of white specks. Thinner, like- not quite as big as an individual, like, dandelion seed, either. And so it looks almost as fine as snow when you look down on the ground at the top of these mountains. It\u0026rsquo;s like a field of snow that the moment you disturb it, kicks up and flies through the air and sinks down, if it reaches far enough, then all the way off the side of the mountain.\nAnd I just lay down. I lay down in it and kind of let that cloud envelop me. It fully obscures the sky for a moment and decide that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;m going to set up camp for the night.\nDUSTY: The nine of hearts. Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s interesting. So hearts are “ruins” and the nine is “deep underground.”\nI think this is where it leads me as I\u0026rsquo;m trying to escape from the interference. I get further enough and I see that my instruments are back up and it\u0026rsquo;s doing scanning of the terrain as I get to more land that\u0026rsquo;s, again, riddled with this blue earth– like, contrasted with green rocks, green stones, green trees– or these dark brown trees, similar to what I would see in books or different planets.\nAnd I get a blip on my radar scanning that there\u0026rsquo;s something below me. At least there should be. I don\u0026rsquo;t see anything but, curious, I decide to land, and I see that there\u0026rsquo;s, essentially, like a cave entrance kind of popping out, but not from a mountainside. It\u0026rsquo;s almost as if it\u0026rsquo;s just a huge boulder carved with a tunnel going down.\nI should think better of this than to just go into a tunnel on my own, but this planet has already caught my curiosity so much. So I think I just descend deeper into it.\nAnd as I descend, I think– this tunnel doesn\u0026rsquo;t have stairs, per se, but it\u0026rsquo;s at an angle down where it\u0026rsquo;s fairly comfortably to walk without slipping, without trying to slow my pace. And the earth below does not seem to be crumbly, does not seem to be freshly dug. This seems to be hardened earth.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m walking one, two, five, ten minutes. And as I decide to think when to turn back, I see a peeking of natural light coming out. And I keep going forward and I\u0026rsquo;m met with what seems to be, now… there is light pouring from a hole in the ceiling, way above. It seems to be these underground… city? Village. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to say. There seems to be buildings. It could be different kinds of structures, statues. All carved with, again, this blue or green stone.\nAnd… I see, again, as I approach these buildings, and I see that there\u0026rsquo;s the same kind of writing that I saw on those trees on top of the mountaintop. So I\u0026rsquo;m seeing the remnants of whatever culture lived here, whether it\u0026rsquo;s connected, or that\u0026rsquo;s just the main language on this planet. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to say.\nAnd I see– I see rooms, I see homes, I see buildings with no one here. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely quiet except for the sound of my footsteps. And I… can\u0026rsquo;t tell if this is… something that was built, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been used? Or something that was built so long ago that whoever used it has not left any signs of life.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s some things here and there– like, I find some tools on top of a crude table in one of these buildings that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t begin to comprehend how to use. I see books and the books, again, are all written in these strange language carvings I can\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nAnd I get to kind of the center of this town, this city, where the light from above is pointing down directly on to what could have been said was perhaps a fountain, maybe a millennia ago. The bowl where water would be held has been cracked and broken open. There seems to be some kind of a statue or some kind of beautiful sculpture on top that has been since knocked down and crumbled to the ground in a million pieces that have eroded, are too small to try to put back together.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s hard to fully comprehend where I am or where I\u0026rsquo;m standing. These buildings that are all kind of abode shaped seem to be again made naturally from the earth around them. Nothing too tall, nothing too short.\nI think… I am met with this feeling of… not loneliness, though I am alone, it\u0026rsquo;s not lonely here. It\u0026rsquo;s sad. It’s… tumultuous. And I think I\u0026rsquo;m getting the same foreboding feeling that I should not be here. And I think that feeling is only exacerbated by something blocking out the light from the hole above, maybe only temporarily, but enough to catch my attention. And I pick up the pace and go back the same tunnel as I leave, trying to leave this place behind me.\nAnd I get up in maybe half the time as I\u0026rsquo;m a little rushing and get back to my ship nearly out of breath. But I still think I want to learn more. So…\nJESS: Okay, next thing. Five… resting. Yeah, that is what I just did. Thank you for listening, dice.\nJack of spades. So we got a natural phenomenon. We haven\u0026rsquo;t had any ruins yet. Not a single heart. I\u0026rsquo;m– I’m a biologist. It\u0026rsquo;s “a natural phenomenon” “in the desert.” Okay, well, cards, you weren\u0026rsquo;t paying attention. I left the desert behind.\nWell, except… I just said that I thought this was snowy. I thought the biome was going to be different. Maybe we are on a Star Wars one biome planet. It\u0026rsquo;s just really, really dry. Mars is dry. This planet can be dry.\nAnd so, like, beneath these plants, it\u0026rsquo;s actually very, very dry up here. They\u0026rsquo;re soaking up whatever there is. And so I am in a desert and I was resting and I wake in the morning to a natural phenomena. And that natural phenomena is…\nHow do these plants survive up here? Nope, I don\u0026rsquo;t got it. Let\u0026rsquo;s go a different direction. They… fold in. Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s the plants again. Oh, I\u0026rsquo;ve got it. Okay, they do fold in and I\u0026rsquo;ve got it.\nSo like morning glories, all of that– like, the white specks get like drawn back into a pod at night and then they open up in the daytime. And of course, that\u0026rsquo;s when I saw them while flying. And so when I wake in the morning just before dawn, because my character, unlike me, can get up that early, she looks around and the fields of white, of false snow are gone. And for the first time, she can see under them. They formed like a full canopy that was just a few centimeters off the ground, but fully obscured it.\nAnd there is something immediately so cool. And I think it is these rock formations of different minerals running, like– you know when you do a vertical slice of a certain type of canyon rock and you get those like– this colour rock and that colour rock and this colour rock, because it got like sedimented or eroded; I don\u0026rsquo;t know which way the process would have gone to give it these striations– but just like a centimeter or a few centimeters of different colours of rock. And that usually would happen with, like, a vertical cut, right? And you\u0026rsquo;re looking at it from the side, a cool little thing in an eyewitness book or in a museum gift shop where you and I would see them maybe.\nUm, but she\u0026rsquo;s seeing them out in the wild, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a vertical cut. It\u0026rsquo;s fully horizontal. These striations are running just, like, across the landscape under these plants. And it\u0026rsquo;s like– it’s like a cliff face turned on its side, or it\u0026rsquo;s like just a whole bunch of different rocks got slammed together and smooshed until we got these, like, multi-layer pancakes, but again, on their side.\nAnd she is fascinated and immediately starts, like, running her fingers along the ground looking for, like, grooves, but clearly it\u0026rsquo;s been worn down on the top enough that it\u0026rsquo;s like a fully even surface. And the plants are actually, like, very shallowly rooted, like, running mostly along the tops. Weird plants. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how they survive up here. Um, but she\u0026rsquo;s fascinated by the– the striations are just beautiful, so of course she\u0026rsquo;s, like, immediately compelled by them. Um.\nAnd she tries to determine if there\u0026rsquo;s some regularity to the pattern and follow them to various, like, cliff faces and looking to get a sense of like, what could have caused this? And I think what she comes to is that there is no way she\u0026rsquo;s going to know. This is the sort of geological study that is: one, outside her wheelhouse, because she\u0026rsquo;s a biologist. Primarily. She\u0026rsquo;s a generalist. She likes– she specializes in biology.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not just outside her wheelhouse. This is the sort of thing that would take years of study and multiple scientists to, like, estimate what are the natural forces in this planet that would produce these striations? And she wants to know. And I think she thinks for a moment, “Am I in the right line of work?” And then she remembers that she\u0026rsquo;d never have seen these striations in the first place if she wasn\u0026rsquo;t going planet to planet all the time. That if she was stuck in one place for years and years, all of the things that cause her that curiosity and that awe, she encounters them because she keeps moving. And she\u0026rsquo;d miss that awe more than she misses the opportunity to explain it, you know?\nDUSTY: Last card here is the queen of diamonds. Okay, so these are more living beings. And this is deep underwater. So that\u0026rsquo;s interesting.\nI think again, I go back to my ship and start just going in another direction. I then find a body of water that\u0026rsquo;s on opposite of where I found the glacier. And… I see… from the surface… I think I see things similar to buoys, or something like that.\nAnd as I\u0026rsquo;m going close, close, I see some kind of birds or some kind of flying creature land on one of these buoys. And then, as soon as the bird or creature gets comfortable, that buoy is then dragged underwater. Almost, like, immediately and with extreme force, extreme purpose, which… I turn my scanners on again and I see a lot of movement down there in the water.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to get out of my ship. So I think instead, what I do– I\u0026rsquo;m going to send a probe down there. Like, these little, like, little mechanised little robot body with a camera that connects to the ship. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to send it down there to see what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\nAnd as it goes into the water, which is as blue as the earth around it– which causes for this strange kind of perception, as you\u0026rsquo;re really unable to see where the earth ends and the water begins as it\u0026rsquo;s kinda the same color– and you\u0026rsquo;re getting deeper and deeper, and I\u0026rsquo;m seeing more signs of movement. And then I see more structures similar to what I saw in that tunnel, more abodes, kind of the same deep colours. But now there\u0026rsquo;s movement around here.\nAnd as it\u0026rsquo;s getting deeper, trying to keep my distance because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to concern anyone or anything, I see that there are humanoid-ish creatures? But I think their skin is a deep, deep brown compared to that of the earth around them. And they seem to be just living their life down here.\nI see another one of those buoys fall to the ground and realise it\u0026rsquo;s almost akin to a fishing net, but just for anything above the surface. And I\u0026rsquo;m trying to notate, okay, so that means that whatever happened here, they’ve been forced, or adapted to live under the water.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s when that moment hits. It\u0026rsquo;s like, well, they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be under the water. What does that mean for me? And I think I call the droid back, the probe droid back, and as soon as it hits on the ship, I think I decide I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here. Either my presence is going to cause problems or problems are going to happen to me, because whatever is on the surface, the humanoid creatures do not want to interact with it. With that, I think I leave this planet.\nAnd for this, in my logs, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to name this planet just… [Thoughtful sigh] Endless Ocean. Endless Ocean, sure. Just for how blue it is as I put it down in my notes.\nOkay. So I think, as I leave that planet in a hurry, I leave via the same route I entered, trying to do as little damage to my ship as possible, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go to my next planet!\nJESS: Okay, last thing on this planet. [Die rolling] Five, resting. Okay. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s been an arduous planet and journey, so of course for the latter ones, she\u0026rsquo;s resting a lot.\nJack, again, in the desert. Is that three Jacks? That is three Jacks on six cards here. Here we go. It\u0026rsquo;s a desert planet. It\u0026rsquo;s a Star– I lied. We are doing Star Wars single biome planets.\nUm, jack of diamonds. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got “living beings,” again,” in the desert.”\nSnakes. Or just some sort of slithering reptile comes to mind for the desert. Um… I don\u0026rsquo;t know– reptile might be too earthy a classification. I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what genuses and species and all that look like here, but I think– I think this is a bit of a fright for our character.\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s some, like… it looks almost like a mirage as she\u0026rsquo;s crossing back towards her ship and decides to take a break in this hot desert. And moving along these- this striated rock– which she can see because the plants here got all kicked up, I guess– there\u0026rsquo;s a sense that the rock itself is moving. And then she realizes it\u0026rsquo;s this flat little scaled creature with coloured striations that match the way there\u0026rsquo;s those thin striations on the rock, and it\u0026rsquo;s the same, like, general palette of colors. It\u0026rsquo;s- it’s not the rock moving. There is something moving over it that is so- it has evolved to be so camouflaged so effectively.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly a snake. It’s… we\u0026rsquo;re going to go Pokemon Gold and Silver again here. You know, like a Dunsparce? Like a flat little scaly creature that\u0026rsquo;s like… you know, like, if you miniaturised an elephant and made it even flatter, even thinner. Um, and that thing is just like… [Blorp-y fast movement sounds] across the ground, um, at me. And I just, like, leap to my feet, and, like, resting is over, and I start like running off to the side, truly spooked.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not following me! It had no interest in me! It was just moving. It didn\u0026rsquo;t know. I might have well been part of the landscape. So the moment I like bolt, it bolts. But I think it takes a little bit for me to, you know, come down.\nBiologist isn\u0026rsquo;t just plants. What\u0026rsquo;s the word for just plants? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t like animals as much, is the thing. This happens with animals. Plants are immobile forms of life, as you could find out on page three of Alone Among the Stars. They don\u0026rsquo;t move of their own volition. So anyway, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t like this. She does note it. She does even take a picture as it\u0026rsquo;s retreating. Um, she\u0026rsquo;s not going to sketch this one because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to, and that wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun, um.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s going to get back to the ship. She\u0026rsquo;s had enough experiences on this planet. It\u0026rsquo;s time for the new awe.\nOkay! Yeah, that was… uh, Persephone-2! You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to name– give a name and number as you leave. So we\u0026rsquo;re going with Persephone-2.\nAnd she leaves.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

Yep. Nope. That\u0026rsquo;s it. I stand by it. This is- I am committing to the things that I do. That\u0026rsquo;s exa- that\u0026rsquo;s the exact delivery that I wanted and it was normal. It\u0026rsquo;s the delivery anyone would have done and they would have felt really good about it.\nLast week we heard our explorers go over a couple of planets. This week we are gonna focus just on one. Let\u0026rsquo;s get out there.\nGAME: PLANET THREE JESS: Do you know that there are botanists? And that they\u0026rsquo;re like biologists, but they specialize in plants? That\u0026rsquo;s a common word that I\u0026rsquo;ve used and heard a million times. But I did have to look it up between planets so that I know that my biologist is a botanist. I\u0026rsquo;m probably being influenced by the biologist from Annihilation here, you know– likes taking notes in her notebook… and I just keep going back to the word biologist because I love her.\nAnyway, we\u0026rsquo;re playing a game. That starts with me rolling a two for how many things I find. So lay out two cards from the deck.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s see how much there is to discover on planet three. [Die clattering] Six. A little more fruitful.\nDUSTY: Four. So another four cards.\nSATAH: Okay so our first thing… I rolled a six, which means that I spotted it while I\u0026rsquo;m resting. It\u0026rsquo;s a king of spades. Spades are \u0026ldquo;natural phenomena\u0026rdquo; and king is \u0026ldquo;floating in the air.\u0026rdquo; Ooh… ah, the examples are so fantastic. \u0026ldquo;Huge crystal formations, mirages, vividly colored lightning, strange clouds, rocks eroded in strange shapes, veins of precious metals, etc.\u0026rdquo;\nSo some sort of natural phenomena floating in the air. I mean, clouds would be easy, for sure.\nI think… thinking of clouds made me sort of go to just general like gaseous forms and I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about steam and immediately started thinking about sort of, like, hot springs and that kind of thing and I love the idea that… I get to this planet and I… I haven\u0026rsquo;t done a lot of space travel? And it\u0026rsquo;s not super comfortable! And I don\u0026rsquo;t like being in a small space for that long. Like, I- I live this life where I am doing something different every day, working outside with my hands, and having to be cramped up in a little spaceship while traveling is… has been- has gotten kind of miserable, and so I\u0026rsquo;m really glad to land, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad to find this natural hot spring.\nAnd, you know, I test the water and whatever and see that it\u0026rsquo;s safe to get into and I want to kind of scrub the metal tin can smell off myself, so I get in there. And while I\u0026rsquo;m in, the steam is there, but the thing that catches my eye is that the sun starts to set, and the atmosphere of this planet means that as the sun sets, it starts to glow this odd, like… blue. This- this- this strangely dark blue the whole way across the horizon, and as it hits the steam, it refracts into– it- it starts to look like a dancing light show of some kind. All of this, like, purple and blue and green– almost– it almost starts to look oily, right? Like, it looks like– it looks a little bit like an oil spill, and it\u0026rsquo;s something that you can only really see when the sun is at a specific angle in this hot spring.\nAnd so I\u0026rsquo;m sitting here watching the air around me transform into this oil slick while everything still smells so clean and inviting and warm. And it feels like this incredible coinciden– like, this- this the stroke of fate, right? This- oh, I\u0026rsquo;m here at exactly the right time. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have seen this if I had been later, or if I had given up earlier, or if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t stayed as long, and so it\u0026rsquo;s exciting and it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful.\nJESS: Four. Come upon it suddenly. We\u0026rsquo;re back to surprises. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly what my character seems to like– my botanist.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;m gona find out… that is a four of hearts. This is our first ruin! Look at that. The magic of randomness. Two planets: no ruins. Third planet: first ruins. This is the one where there\u0026rsquo;s been stuff. No stuff on the other ones. Untouched. There\u0026rsquo;s been stuff here.\nAnd so we got stuff \u0026ldquo;in a steep canyon.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, I think I can tell from space, like– there are large patterns that do not look natural. It\u0026rsquo;s like, oh, something either is here, or was here, but I\u0026rsquo;m not getting like, you know, your classic energy readings. I\u0026rsquo;m not getting radio communications. And so I decide to put down, uh, near some of the stuff.\nAnd I land at the top of a tall canyon. Or– what I think is a canyon. I put my ship down and I get out, thinking I\u0026rsquo;ve landed on, like, the like top plateau of this, like, cliff, and then very suddenly, I realise this is construction. It\u0026rsquo;s made to imitate a natural phenomena– made to imitate just, like, rock, but I\u0026rsquo;m on, effectively, a skyscraper. And part of why I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell at first is because, like, it\u0026rsquo;s so dense. As in, like, it goes on for dozens, even hundreds of kilometers, looking just like the the top of this building that I\u0026rsquo;m- that I just landed on, with, like, what I now recognize as, like, little grooves that I mistook for ravines and canyons. That\u0026rsquo;s just the ground below. This is- this is a incredibly densely packed vertically built city. Dead and empty, but a city– or it was. I\u0026rsquo;m very much taking from Trantor and Foundation and Coruscant here– just the, like, planet whose surface is the top of the city that is the planet. Though maybe just part of it.\nAnd, yeah I think I\u0026rsquo;m just staring over the side, realizing that what I\u0026rsquo;m seeing down at the bottom are, like, roads? But… just enough for, like… if it was people sized beings moving through them, like, two directions of people walking. We\u0026rsquo;re not doing– this is not America. We\u0026rsquo;re not doing suburban car dependent hell. Whoever built this place wanted people to go somewhere and be able to, like, get there without a car. Good for them. You\u0026rsquo;re extinct anyway, but at least it wasn\u0026rsquo;t from cars, so, that\u0026rsquo;s a win.\nAnd yeah I\u0026rsquo;m just staring down and looking at the top of these buildings and I am curious: why did they- why they make the tops look so natural? It\u0026rsquo;s a planet of environmentalists. No cars, natural- natural buildings. But, yeah– this isn\u0026rsquo;t what I usually catalog, right? Because most planets aren\u0026rsquo;t inhabited. That\u0026rsquo;s just the way it is. And I\u0026rsquo;m a botanist. But this is so cool, right?\nAnd so I take my time and I\u0026rsquo;m writing down, like, names of– well, not names, because the script is unrecognisable– symbols that I am guessing are signs and language. And I\u0026rsquo;m taking pictures, I\u0026rsquo;m sketching some of them, I\u0026rsquo;m, like, cataloging to see if I can try and recognise any repetition of the symbols, even though I\u0026rsquo;m not a linguist. I just don\u0026rsquo;t get to do this type of work much, so I- I really give it my all when I can.\nSATAH: I rolled another six so this is something else I spot while I\u0026rsquo;m resting. I– shout out to this character for taking the time to chill. What a– what an icon and an inspiration for all of us. Especially me.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the queen of diamonds. So diamonds are \u0026ldquo;living beings: people like or unlike you, fish, dinosaurs, wolves, birds, giant insects, etc.\u0026rdquo; and queen is \u0026ldquo;in deep water.\u0026rdquo;\nSo… I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna extend this as like– this is the same sort of period of rest. Like I saw these beautiful lights, and they kind of start to fade as the sun goes down properly the rest of the way and I\u0026rsquo;m in these springs. And I think I kind of lazily start moving towards… to explore, like, the source of the spring? I want to see if I can find out where it\u0026rsquo;s coming from. And that involves getting out of the water, following a trickle of water or whatever, all the way to a very deep pool\nIs it- people? Or are they, at least, a sapient creature of some kind? I think… what it is is that there are nocturnal eels that have similar colouring… that blue and purple and green sort of opalescent oil spill-y colouring on them. And they weren\u0026rsquo;t there when I walked by this earlier. And they– they rise up and they- they- they are glowing a little? Like, it- it– at first, I think it\u0026rsquo;s just a reflection of the last lingering bits of sun in the sky, and then I realise that it\u0026rsquo;s moving in a way that- that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, that- that isn\u0026rsquo;t the way that reflections move, or that they\u0026rsquo;re moving in– at a different, uh, pace than the small waves on- on top. On the surface.\n[Urgent meow] Hi, Garold. Hi buddy. And they meow. The eels meow.\nAnd… that\u0026rsquo;s it. It\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s just this- this thing I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen. Maybe the place that I am from doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of… deep water? Like it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a terraformed– it\u0026rsquo;s mostly terraformed and has very artificially constructed bodies of water. And so seeing this huge natural body of water with these strange creatures that are unlike anything I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen doing their weird… [Distant meow] little night dances and eel meows is amazing. And I stop and sit by this- this water for a while, and just… just watch them.\nDUSTY: This is also coming upon it suddenly. I think what happened is that heading to somewhere else that is at least logged, I go through the coordinates to get near it, as I don\u0026rsquo;t know the exact coordinates of the planet, and I enter basically, um, a hyperspace instant. Not an instant but a faster than light travel that this ship is capable of. And when I exit it, where I should be in this place that\u0026rsquo;s just space, I am met with me being just above a planet that is neither marked nor logged nor has knowledge about.\nAnd I think with that, it\u0026rsquo;s a little sudden for me as I decide, yes I want to go. But I think I give myself a little bit of time. I think I rest or recuperate I really decide what I want to do before I go down. But maybe a day or two later, I descend!\nAnd what do I find first? A ten of spades. Ah, interesting. Another cliff face and a phenomena.\nI think how this one goes is that I\u0026rsquo;m descending towards this planet, and this planet seems to be rockier. The major way that you could see it– it\u0026rsquo;s almost labyrinthine in appearance, as there\u0026rsquo;s huge valleys, kind of broken by these giant mountainous cliffs as they\u0026rsquo;re kind of going along and creating, like a.. a specific path that you should– that you will need to, if you\u0026rsquo;re on land, trying to go through here.\nAnd I think I land center of one of these paths. That there\u0026rsquo;s cliff faces all around me, and I see that the cliff front of me is rocky, is… huge, but it\u0026rsquo;s different than previous mountains I\u0026rsquo;ve seen before, in that it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly smooth- as if there\u0026rsquo;s no blemishes, as if there\u0026rsquo;s no pockets from deterioration.\nAnd I think before I decide to get out of my ship to really examine it, suddenly the earth shakes violently and the sound as if something\u0026rsquo;s been cracked in two happens, and I see now, as I decide to ascend and get away from the ground in case it falls beneath me, that these mountain faces are moving. That this whole planet is kind of restructured. Maybe not the whole planet, but all that I could see, is kind of moving. And I get high enough and I see that this labyrinthine pattern is changing. The paths are moving, and whatever was there isn\u0026rsquo;t. Is obviously somewhere else now. And that puts me at extreme unease. As if– okay is there someone here watching? Something\u0026rsquo;s happening? Or is this just how this planet works?\nBut instead of that unease pushing me away, I think I need to know more. So…\nSATAH: I rolled another six, so I also saw the next thing while I\u0026rsquo;m resting. I love vacation planet. This is my vacation planet and I love it.\nIt is the king of hearts. Hearts are \u0026ldquo;ruins\u0026rdquo;; the king is \u0026ldquo;floating in the air.\u0026rdquo;\nI think… not all of the ruins are going to be ships… maybe. Maybe they are. But I think… this one is. It\u0026rsquo;s floating in the air… ohh. It\u0026rsquo;s in transit. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s not floating stationarily– [Laughs at how they stumbled through that word] Stati– it\u0026rsquo;s not stationary and floating in the air.\nI see… as I\u0026rsquo;m sitting by this lake, watching how the visual spectacle of these eels changes, as the last of the light truly disappears from the sky. And I see something in the water that at first I think is, like, one of the eels doing a little thing, and then hear a sound and realize it\u0026rsquo;s reflecting a light in the sky, and I look up. And I see the ship. And I stand in, like, a panic, and excitement. And then the lights change– the lights on the ship– and it- it goes into some sort of hyperdrive. Like, it– it warps to a totally different place. There\u0026rsquo;s no way that I could catch up to it. Even if I\u0026rsquo;d already been flying, without having similar coordinates, there\u0026rsquo;s no way that a- a ship of a class like mine could track a ship that\u0026rsquo;s just done a hyperspace jump.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it. And… there isn\u0026rsquo;t even– there isn\u0026rsquo;t even a moment of disappointment, really. It is just– it\u0026rsquo;s there, and it\u0026rsquo;s gone, and I\u0026rsquo;m just– I\u0026rsquo;ve been surrounded by this new, inexplicable type of beauty all day as I\u0026rsquo;ve been chillin\u0026rsquo; out on a weird blue vacation planet, so all I can feel is, like… excitement. Looking at the space where the ship was, and being like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m on the right track and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna catch up to you.\u0026rdquo;\nDUSTY: So that leads me to… the five of hearts. Ruins. Ruins in a treetop.\nAnd I think how this leaves me is that I\u0026rsquo;m traveling over these ruins for a while, and nothing seems to be moving again. It\u0026rsquo;s been maybe an hour, and the rock cliff and the mountains and the valleys below have not changed again.\nAnd then I see this first spot of green. This huge… huge tree that seems to be coming out from these valleys, as though poking out from the earth, scraping the sky, um, a little bit away from all these mountain tops. As I see from the canopy- as I fly closer, though, as this thing is hundreds of feet in the air, there seems to be a structure that, maybe at one point was fully intact? It almost seems that there is… it was ripped apart.\nAs I get closer, my ship\u0026rsquo;s able to land in it fairly comfortably. And looking- looking from down here, I– it feels like a workspace? There\u0026rsquo;s tables. There\u0026rsquo;s, again, seems, tools. Some of these are familiar tools, some kind of also what used to be computers that… screens are cracked, wires are exposed. Some of it\u0026rsquo;s even rusting from how long it\u0026rsquo;s been exposed. And when they get to a certain point, I look up and it feels that the way that the roof in places ripped off almost feels like it was… quite literally ripped off. Torn asunder. Not perfectly in half, but not seemingly random. As if something hit it and tore it away. It\u0026rsquo;s a strange, strange feeling.\nI think as I\u0026rsquo;m going through these ruins of this workshop, I find something… that looks like, perhaps, like a- like a footlocker, that\u0026rsquo;s still closed. And my curiosity gets the better of me and I kind of– making sure I put gloves on before I catch anything by accident, cutting myself– open it up and I see that there is this rock in there. And this rock is kind of blanketed up in some sort of cloth. And I go looking at it– it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look strange, doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel strange, but I do feel that I should take it. It\u0026rsquo;s not doing anything here. There doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be anyone that could get up here, at least easily. So I take this cloth covered kind of– imperfectly round? It\u0026rsquo;s round, but it\u0026rsquo;s got edges, similar to that, like, a polyhedral kind of vibe. And I take it back to the ship and decide I should kind of go around and find more.\nSATAH: [Die clatter] For our next discovery, I rolled a three, which means I \u0026ldquo;came upon it suddenly.\u0026rdquo; And it is an ace of clubs. Clubs are \u0026ldquo;plants and other immobile forms of life\u0026rdquo; and an ace is \u0026ldquo;in a field taller than you.\u0026rdquo;\nSo it would make sense that the field… it\u0026rsquo;s a field of the things. Of these plants that I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered.\nI \u0026ldquo;came upon it suddenly…\u0026rdquo;\nI like the idea that this planet changes drastically between night and day. Like, it– like, how it had those- those- those sunset steam light shows and these nocturnal eels that pop up… I spend the night camping beside my ship. Not inside it. As much as possible, I want to spend time outside the ship, so I set up a little tent or something like that, and I\u0026rsquo;m camping beside the ship.\nAnd in the morning, I get up. It\u0026rsquo;s a long night here on this planet. The sun isn\u0026rsquo;t up for very long.\nAnd I start walking… maybe to find a hill or something? Like, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that I can get a signal to send a communication or to co– calculate my next coordinates without having to actually get into the ship and fly up into the air. So I\u0026rsquo;m walking to a place that looks elevated enough that I can just do it from here.\nAnd as I\u0026rsquo;m walking, at first, I think it\u0026rsquo;s an earthquake. The ground is, like, moving underneath me, and then all of a sudden, I\u0026rsquo;m in this field. Of these tall plants. They\u0026rsquo;re all stretching towards the sun and I realise, it\u0026rsquo;s like– it\u0026rsquo;s a- it\u0026rsquo;s a plant that, during the night, just lays down. Just completely goes– is utterly at rest at night, and then as the sun starts to peek over the horizon, they shoot up and point towards it to pull in as much of that light and that energy as they can.\nAnd so I\u0026rsquo;m walking through this field, and having the very distinct sense that the plants are moving with me? Like watching a time-lapse of a sunflower following the sun? But it\u0026rsquo;s all around me and they\u0026rsquo;re taller than me, and moving so surprisingly fast, especially with the lack of wind. It\u0026rsquo;s surreal and a little uncomfortable. I think more uncomfortable than I\u0026rsquo;ve been on the planet so far? Just- just the feeling of suddenly being enclosed, I don\u0026rsquo;t love, but I\u0026rsquo;m able to follow the direction that they\u0026rsquo;re pointing to keep going up to get to this hill to try and figure out these coordinates.\nAnd I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna take inspiration from the next thing to see whether I successfully unscramble those coordinates while on this planet.\nDUSTY: So here I find more ruins. Seven of hearts. But I find this near a volcano.\nI think… as I ascend, I start flying further out, and I see now that I\u0026rsquo;m finally leaving this labyrinthian mountainous valleys and all that. And… I see that the land is getting closer to… a body of water, almost? And there seems to be another mountain, except that mountain is… not a mountain. I could see from heat signatures that, oh, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a volcano. Dormant or not, unsure, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely hotter than the earth and water around it.\nAnd there again at the bottom, I see more structures. These are strange. They\u0026rsquo;re alll actually built, it seems, out of stone. Maybe some other material. But they\u0026rsquo;re all resembling different geometrical shapes. They\u0026rsquo;re not simple as a square building, or, like, a rectangular tower, or anything like that. There are some that are small pyramids, some that are shaped into that of like a three-dimensional hexagon. Even that, where some look like they\u0026rsquo;re giant tents, almost, where cloth was down- thrown down on a pinpoint and creating like this huge tent.\nAnd as I decide to look, I sent out another probe. There seems to be a layer of ash over all of these. The ash, though, is what\u0026rsquo;s giving its colour. You see that some wind blows and there\u0026rsquo;s like a more bronze looking material under all this, like, light gray ash of these buildings. And you think that maybe at one point this volcano wasn\u0026rsquo;t always here, as this used to be seen just people lived here. And it wasn\u0026rsquo;t like a fishing village or a farming village or anything in that sort, it seemed that just people lived here. You could see a path leading out towards looks like a forest or a jungle or something of that sorts, and a path leading to the water with the remnants of, like, maybe a tiny dock for one or two boats to go through, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really initially feel all that important. It just seems that there\u0026rsquo;s people here at one point. You don\u0026rsquo;t see any life here. No people, no skeletons, no- no animals or creatures.\nAnd then through the probe, I see another box. This one, a little bit more pristine, actually. Not covered in ash, not covered in rust, not covered in dust. And I send it over and I use the little probe droids little tiny arms that come out to see– just because, again, I\u0026rsquo;m curious as ever– and it sees another rock in there. Another strange, perfectly imperfect circle. The shape and the size, a little different in the one I grabbed from the other place. I think I\u0026rsquo;m too curious and I have it grab it and the cloth that\u0026rsquo;s surrounding it. A similar material, from the looks? I\u0026rsquo;ll have to see when it gets here.\nAnd as the probe droid\u0026rsquo;s entering back into the ship and it brings that cloth, I hear the unmistakable sound again of this mountains moving, and I decided to move away from this volcano as fast as possible. Which I do.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] It\u0026rsquo;s a six. I… don\u0026rsquo;t fuckin\u0026rsquo; at me; I\u0026rsquo;m Saturday chillin\u0026rsquo;! On the blue planet! I spot this while I\u0026rsquo;m resting, baby! It\u0026rsquo;s a nine of hearts!\nSo hearts are \u0026ldquo;ruins\u0026rdquo; and a nine is \u0026ldquo;deep underground.\u0026rdquo; Ohh, interesting. I was so ready to be like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s a big ruined radio tower and I climb up it because I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get to high ground or whatever,\u0026rdquo; then it says deep underground, and throws me for a… beautiful little loop.\nWhy am I underground?\nMaybe, similarly to the– sort of in the- in the theme of this planet being very different in the night and the day, there\u0026rsquo;s some sort of predator fauna that is only active during the height of the sun. So it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s really only for a couple hours, but this creature appears and threatens me and I run.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a combination of on purpose and by accident that I sort of– I start– I\u0026rsquo;m trying to duck into a cave, and it turns out it\u0026rsquo;s not a cave, it is… a. Hole. And I just end up sliding down, way into this place. And so I do successfully hide, and- and it hurts my little knees and my elbows a bit, and I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m nursing these wounds. And I\u0026rsquo;m… I think– I like the idea that I\u0026rsquo;ve been on this planet for a few days now. We haven\u0026rsquo;t seen all of it, but I really have just been like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna chill here for a little while.\u0026rdquo; And my coordinates are unscrambling. I\u0026rsquo;ve got that going. I\u0026rsquo;ll– I will leave, when I know where I\u0026rsquo;m going. But I\u0026rsquo;m not hurrying it up.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m resting. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned how to listen for the sounds of the sun rising and setting. There\u0026rsquo;s just– the activity is just so different, based on whether the sun is up or not, that I can hear it. I can hear the difference; I\u0026rsquo;ve learned the difference. And so I\u0026rsquo;m sitting underground, hiding from this… alien jaguar… and I spot a ruin.\nSo this one isn\u0026rsquo;t a spaceship, but I like the idea that it is somehow related to it. It\u0026rsquo;s… a tent. Not exactly like mine, but it is a precursor to mine? Obviously a very old, but standard issue explorers shelter of some kind. It\u0026rsquo;s in the same colour as the captain\u0026rsquo;s uniform, the pilot\u0026rsquo;s uniform that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a couple times now. And it\u0026rsquo;s been abandoned… trying to think if there are signs, like I… this- this gives me time– I can actually investigate it for signs of what might have happened?\nAnd I think all I can really see is that they did plan to come back. There are, like– their– I can see their system of rations, you know? They\u0026rsquo;ve got everything organised, and I can count how many days they were here by their very tidily piled empty containers, and I can see their full containers that were organised for future days, meal by meal. And all evidence points toward: they were planning to come back to this shelter. And something must have happened while they were gone. No idea what, but they spent some time here.\nAnd I hang out in that tent for a while, I think. I- I check the expiry date on the rations… ooh. Does that give me information? … No. I think it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s just it\u0026rsquo;s the same, it\u0026rsquo;s… well, it\u0026rsquo;s information I might not have had, but it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s information that, if I could contact that person who\u0026rsquo;s investigating the first ship I found, in the garage, it would be congruent with that. Like, these are OLD. But they don\u0026rsquo;t look as old as they should? It\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s food from fifty years ago that only has two years of grime on it, or something like that.\nAnd I take them. Because I think they\u0026rsquo;re probably fine. And I wait until sunset, and…\nI want to leave a note, I think. Just leave a card that says. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m looking for you,\u0026rdquo; and a radio frequency? I want– it… it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m looking for you,\u0026rdquo; it… \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m on your trail\u0026rdquo;? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m following you\u0026rdquo;? I know that\u0026rsquo;s threatening, but it\u0026rsquo;s just… \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m right behind you\u0026rdquo; and a radio frequency on a card. The idea that if they, in their loop, return back to familiar places, maybe, to see where they went wrong, or maybe because they\u0026rsquo;re figuring out the perfect time loop and it involves going to the same place over and over again occasionally. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to start leaving notes. Ooh, maybe some of the rations are from– there are very different levels of rust and grime on some of the rations, which leads me to believe that this person has been here more than once. Maybe not recently, but who knows how long these things take.\nSo I leave the card. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m right behind you.\u0026rdquo; The radio frequency. And I see one more thing on this planet.\nJESS: And I got one more for this planet. [Die rolling] I come upon it suddenly. I really get surprised by a lot of things, which is why I\u0026rsquo;m in this line of work. To be surprised by plants. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out if it\u0026rsquo;s a plant. Spades. \u0026ldquo;Natural phenomena.\u0026rdquo; Close. My second favourite thing. And it\u0026rsquo;s a three: \u0026ldquo;by a gentle river.\u0026rdquo; Bringing it back around.\nSee– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– I really want a lot of this planet to be artifice, and so I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to say that like I descended a bit into the city, and… I think, actually, when it comes to natural phenomena, what I\u0026rsquo;m looking at here is decay. And specifically, like, if you\u0026rsquo;re gonna have this city– like this is– this massive, like, continent sprawling city, you got to feed it, and it generally takes much more land to feed a place than it does to house the people in it. That\u0026rsquo;s how society works, and I guess also whatever lived here. And so they have a lot of hydroponics, is my guess.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s this building with what I recognise as- as potentially hydroponic setups. I\u0026rsquo;m a botanist, so I would know what that looks like. And there\u0026rsquo;s these pipes that are all over this building, um and- and collection ones, too, so- so lots of– planet of environmentalists. And they\u0026rsquo;re gathering lots of water, and so those water gatherers, those just like passive reservoirs, are still filling, but there\u0026rsquo;s no one to drain them. There\u0026rsquo;s no one to direct the flow. And so it\u0026rsquo;s just this flooded building where they used to grow these plants.\nAnd hilariously, it\u0026rsquo;s not any more vegetated than anywhere else, because… it\u0026rsquo;s ruins. It\u0026rsquo;s, uh– life prevails, in some way. But it is this, like, massive–almost waterfall, now, I think. That\u0026rsquo;s what– that\u0026rsquo;s what the quote-unquote natural phenomena is, is this building has been turned into a waterfall because all of the runoff from everywhere nearby was funneled into this building, for this massive vertical farm. And with no one to direct that flow, and, like, all of these decrepit systems, it has turned the face of this building into a waterfall.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s such an interesting way to look at a building, to imagine what a building can be, is- is the cliff face of a waterfall. And I think I\u0026rsquo;m really struck by that image, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s something that sticks with my character as a way of looking at a more familiar world, you know?\nSATAH: [Die clattering] And it\u0026rsquo;s while I\u0026rsquo;m resting, baby! Another six! Do! NOT at me! I am Saturday chillin\u0026rsquo;!!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s five of diamonds. Diamonds are \u0026ldquo;living beings\u0026rdquo; and a five is \u0026ldquo;in a treetop.\u0026rdquo; Ooh!\nMy first thought was… someone trying to get the… tree… the- the- the ship that was in the tree– someone is investigating. It could be a local. Then I thought maybe the pilot. And now I\u0026rsquo;m wondering… if it\u0026rsquo;s me. I see myself up in this tree, investigating the ship that\u0026rsquo;s up there.\nAnd… is it immediately obvious to me whether it\u0026rsquo;s me from the future or past or unknown?\nI think at first, I think it is the pilot, because I\u0026rsquo;m wearing the uniform. The me in the tree is wearing the uniform. And… the- the me in the tree looks down. And I\u0026rsquo;m just standing, stock still, staring, wondering if this is like an alternate universe… if this is more time travel, what it is… and they look at me. And they smile. And laugh and they go, \u0026ldquo;Oh, shit. I\u0026rsquo;m too early.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they disappear somehow; how do they disappear? No, ok– so it\u0026rsquo;s, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m too early,\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;m just confused, and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;What? Wait! Tell me what\u0026rsquo;s going on! Are you me? What are we doing?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they grin and they\u0026rsquo;re like… they say, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you\u0026rsquo;re right behind us.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd around me, all of those weird plants pop up as the sun rises. And it happened so suddenly. I try– I\u0026rsquo;m trying to fight my way forward, but I stopped, I was surprised, so I was pretty far back from the tree. And I\u0026rsquo;m trying to fight my way forward, but I can\u0026rsquo;t see them anymore, and by the time I get there, they\u0026rsquo;re not there anymore. And neither is the ship, I think. Which makes me think they were trying to… I don\u0026rsquo;t know; I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out. Because the tone of that was very much, like, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re on the right path,\u0026rdquo; but then I like the idea they\u0026rsquo;re taken the ship because they don\u0026rsquo;t want me to follow… but maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a whole other thing going on. And… it\u0026rsquo;s fun. I– that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s okay. I… Lost ended in a satisfying way, right? So I bet this will. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen Lost.\nDUSTY: And I pull the king of hearts. More ruins, but now it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;floating in the sky.\u0026rdquo;\nI think I come upon these as I go over the water, trying to get away from the- the seismic activity. And from there, I keep going, and I see notifications of, like, my radar– of something blipping, not below me, but above me, which I can\u0026rsquo;t see, as there\u0026rsquo;s a layer of clouds. So I decide to fly up and I see that there is a floating structure. But it\u0026rsquo;s almost akin to these rocks that I found. It\u0026rsquo;s polyhedral in shape, that is seemingly just floating in the air. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing tied to it, there\u0026rsquo;s no visible symbols.\nAnd you see that on one of its faces, there\u0026rsquo;s clearly an opening to go inside, and I do. I fly my ship in there. It\u0026rsquo;s clearly big enough for ships much bigger than mine. And inside this huge impossible shape, the structure, there\u0026rsquo;s very little. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly empty, save for holes in the ceiling to allow light to enter, and a table– or a pedestal, or some kind of coffin? Something strange in that shape in the middle.\nAnd as I get out, these– both of these rocks in my hand actually begin to vibrate. And I\u0026rsquo;m getting closer, and they seem to be vibrating with more intensity and almost, like, starting to glow. So I decide to take them out and go towards the center, and you see, there, is a similar one. Sorry– a similar- a similar rock. Kind of similar in the same shape, but more or less sides, kind of hard to tell, and I see divots that– putting the two together, I decide to place those rocks in there. When they do, they stop vibrating. And then the other rock, and these two that I just placed there, all egan to glow brightly. I almost have to cover my eyes with how bright they glow.\nAnd now I feel this dome shifting, shaking. At first it seems to just be reverberating, and now it\u0026rsquo;s getting more tumultuous, and getting, almost, I feel, it\u0026rsquo;s about to rip itself apart.\nRight before I decide to run back to my ship, I see the rocks in front of me have kind of dissolved. And on this pedestal, this rock, this table, lies three coins that seemingly were inside these rocks, or something of that sort. I struggle with myself to decide whether or not I should take them. Whether I should just leave them here, or take them back from whatever purpose they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to serve. I think, before I finish that thought, a piece of the ceiling kind of crashes down behind this table, a little bit ahead of me, and the floor in front of me starts to fall. And I just decide I do not need to go risk my life for that.\nAnd run back. Run back to my ship start its engines and fly back off to space, which, um, despite its vastness, feels safer than this planet I was just on.\nAnd I think… as I\u0026rsquo;m leaving, I think… in my logs, the only thing that makes sense to name this planet is Labyrinth.\nSATAH: [Urgent distant meows] I gotta… gotta… I gotta get this young man out of here!

Check out their links in the episode description and follow them both on social media to hear more about their ongoing and upcoming projects, like the new edition of Jess\u0026rsquo; satirical sci-fi skirmish game PLANET FIST and Dusty\u0026rsquo;s TTRPG character interview podcast, Intarotgation.\nIn the game text of Alone Among the Stars, it says, play until you get tired, and then decide what to do with the record of your journey. If it brings you joy, you can keep it. If it brings you pain, you can burn it. For reasons of podcast production instead, I asked everybody to do exactly five planets, and it seems, hopefully, like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t painful enough for anybody to want to burn it, because here it is. You\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to it.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s head out into the black, see what our explorers find on their final two planets of this chapter of their journey– the chapter that we are privileged enough to witness– and wish them luck as they continue off into space for the rest of their lives. Whether that\u0026rsquo;s literal, continuing to explore in a ship, or whether they land, much like us all, here on Earth, orbiting through the stars, infinitely, together, and alone… among the stars! Like the tabletop role-playing game.\nGAME: PLANET FOUR SATAH: Good morning, astronauts.\nJESS: Okay, how many things on planet four? We didn\u0026rsquo;t name planet three.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s go to another planet.\nJESS: So that was… that was Aurora two, because I rolled two on the die, which isn\u0026rsquo;t how I did it for the rest of them, but it is for that one.\nDUSTY: Let\u0026rsquo;s continue on this journey. Okay, one.\nJESS: One!\nDUSTY: One thing on my next planet.\nJESS: Star Wars biome planet. There\u0026rsquo;s one thing to find here.\nSATAH: Three. [Cards being dealt, die clattering]\nSo you won\u0026rsquo;t believe it. But the first thing that I discover? I discover while I\u0026rsquo;m resting. [Laughing] I am so inspired by this character really taking the time that they need. It feels– I was just thinking as I- as I put these cards down, a couple of them– I\u0026rsquo;m putting them down, you know, face down, and a couple of them were obviously upside down. I can tell from the print on the back and it put me in tarot mode where I was thinking of cards reversed. And so being in the place of thinking about cards, uh, as oracles and guidance… I guess technically, the cards aren\u0026rsquo;t telling me shit. The die is telling me to relax and sending a lot of signals. And much like tarot, isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the universe, but there is always a message in the messages you get from symbols.\nSo. Jack of hearts. Hearts are \u0026ldquo;ruins.\u0026rdquo; Hell yeah, baby. And jack is \u0026ldquo;the desert.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I am going to make this another one of the abandoned planes. And I think that the specific thing happening here is that I\u0026rsquo;ve come to this planet and am fairly sure that I\u0026rsquo;m not going to find the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. Like I\u0026rsquo;ve- I\u0026rsquo;ve looked and I\u0026rsquo;ve run– maybe, maybe at this point I\u0026rsquo;ve started to develop a way of pinging for the ships that\u0026rsquo;s, like, relatively reliable to sort of– or I think I have. And I\u0026rsquo;ve, I\u0026rsquo;ve looked all over this planet and haven\u0026rsquo;t had any luck yet. And I think part of me is starting to believe there\u0026rsquo;s a fated aspect to this. So if I don\u0026rsquo;t find something, it\u0026rsquo;s not there?\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s actually the most satisfying thing here. I\u0026rsquo;ve looked and I come to this conviction, like, \u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t found it, therefore it\u0026rsquo;s not here. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t been left here for me. Or it\u0026rsquo;s not, it\u0026rsquo;s not my destiny or my fate to find a ship here. So I\u0026rsquo;ll- I\u0026rsquo;ll move on.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m Saturday chilling outside my ship; I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get back in quite yet. And I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of this desert. Maybe I also can\u0026rsquo;t take off because there\u0026rsquo;s this sort of like windstorm happening, but it\u0026rsquo;s not super dangerous. I\u0026rsquo;m able to be outside in my protective weather gear and just looking at this storm.\nAnd then as the storm clears and I\u0026rsquo;m just relaxing for a little bit, making sure that it\u0026rsquo;s not going to come back up, a bunch of sand dies down and I see it: an abandoned ship, that same model of ship that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen over and over again. It was hidden by the storm and it was also under a dune that like a- a- just a pile of sand, that has now been blown away by the storm and I see it. And it\u0026rsquo;s a double– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a double whammy of feelings, both of, um, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I was so sure. I was so sure that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t one here.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then that other part of me going, \u0026ldquo;But it did reveal itself to you.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve got warring prophecy girl things going on inside of me of, \u0026ldquo;This can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be right,\u0026rdquo; and also, \u0026ldquo;This is proof that it is.\u0026rdquo; And I try to push both of those back to the back of my mind and walk over to the ship and start looking around in it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s mostly full of sand. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell how long it\u0026rsquo;s been there. I think I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get a sense of that now, but it\u0026rsquo;s often difficult because they\u0026rsquo;re just kind of left in natural environments or crashed, and so it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to keep track of.\nDUSTY: I rolled a six. So this one means I find this planet as I\u0026rsquo;m resting. I think… after the perilous feeling journeys of the last two, I decided to take a break and kind of go set my coordinates for a more familiar, um, scene. Maybe a planet that I have been to previously where there\u0026rsquo;s people I know, places I love, food I could eat.\nAnd kind of just in the cockpit writing notes about my findings, trying to figure out what to do next. And I see on the radar, a cluster of moons and such like that appear, but there seems to be another planet that shows up on my radar. And I kind of pull up my visuals in the cockpit and see that there seems to be a small, almost Pluto-sized planet– which is just kind of a turn of phrase, as I\u0026rsquo;ve never been to Pluto. But I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about it from all the stories and whether people or not they consider it a planet, I think in my heart… if it has a name, it should be called a planet at that point. Similar– different to moons. Moons have names, but they\u0026rsquo;re moons.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s a small planet surrounded by a cluster of maybe five or six moons. And I decided that I have time. I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to go back to that place immediately. No one there is exactly expecting me. So I think I decide to go check it out and I find…\nKing of clubs. So another floating in the air situation, and clubs are plants or other forms of life.\nAnd I think as I\u0026rsquo;m descending down onto this planet, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to describe what there is from above, almost as if there\u0026rsquo;s a huge cloud or marine layer above this whole planet.\nAnd as I start descending, I see that there is something huge in the sky. Something enormous that immediately pings on my radar as if it\u0026rsquo;s trying to contact a bigger ship, the size of maybe a destroyer or something like that.\nAnd I see… as I finally descend through this cloud, this giant plant in the air. Almost floating like a Miranda with the giant petals, but like a lotus, as it\u0026rsquo;s flat. And it\u0026rsquo;s this beautiful amalgamation of colors. The green vibrant life that you see from healthy plants and petals of all different colours of pinks and blues, of purples, of colours indescribable with my human vernacular.\nAnd then I notice that these clouds are actually coming from this enormous flower or what have you. That almost from the center, almost like a cyclone of dust and air and wind, it\u0026rsquo;s floating up into the sky. And you see that seems to be not stopping, which, really– I had to think how long that would have to go to cover the entire planet.\nAnd this seeks my attention towards the earth below it. And below… is nothing. Not that there\u0026rsquo;s no earth or no water– there\u0026rsquo;s definitely earth, but this dust has been falling around for so long that whatever was down there has been covered by the dust, or been absorbed by it.\nSo this planet itself seems to just be this one indescribable unimaginable flower? Can you call it a flower anymore? This planet is now not just a planet, it\u0026rsquo;s whatever this thing\u0026rsquo;s is home. It\u0026rsquo;s the pond that it lays in and lets itself propagate, but this propagation has ruined anything else that will live here.\nAnd that is enough to have me decide that I should not be here and I do not want to be here, lest I become like the dust below. I put a quick log to set back towards that course of where I was going to and look back on that flower one last time… in fear.\nI think, in my logs, I just call this planet Dust, because that\u0026rsquo;s all that\u0026rsquo;s left.\nSATAH: I guess I decide to hang out on this planet for a little while longer to look around because I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this, and what do I discover next? Something that is arduous to get to.\nEight of diamonds. Diamonds are \u0026ldquo;living beings.\u0026rdquo; Eight is \u0026ldquo;on a glacier.\u0026rdquo; Huh…\nSo I think the first thing here is that… so having seen the ship, I turn my radio– I think it\u0026rsquo;s always on, because I left that radio frequency at the last place. I\u0026rsquo;ve been leaving it a couple of places. And it\u0026rsquo;s always receiving, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t– I\u0026rsquo;m not always necessarily paying direct attention to it. But in this moment I see the ship and I start to pay direct attention to it.\nAnd I think… hmm, timey wimey bullshit. I\u0026rsquo;m listening to it and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing and there\u0026rsquo;s a signal suddenly coming in. And the way that it sounds– I can tell from sort of the decay of it, that this is a signal that has been broadcasting for a very long time, but I know that it hasn\u0026rsquo;t because I didn\u0026rsquo;t hear it until now. It just suddenly appears, already very old.\nBut with the help of that new thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve been experimenting with– the, like, locating thing that doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to successfully find the ships, but has been helping me learn how to narrow in on locations– I find the source of the signal and it\u0026rsquo;s on this planet and I start following it.\nAnd it is a– I have to do it in my plane, in my ship, and it is a miserable flight. The storm doesn\u0026rsquo;t pop back up, but… it\u0026rsquo;s shifted the ground and the sand so much that my usual navigation systems don\u0026rsquo;t feel as reliable? Because, you know, they\u0026rsquo;re trying to ping parts of the ground to say like, hey, you\u0026rsquo;re too close, or go this way, or whatever. And I\u0026rsquo;m just getting fed weird information, because the ground isn\u0026rsquo;t as solid as it should be. It\u0026rsquo;s all shifted.\nAnd so my ship is giving me strange signals as I\u0026rsquo;m trying to navigate. And it\u0026rsquo;s bright and hot and I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to– I haven\u0026rsquo;t found any water to sort of wash off in. So there\u0026rsquo;s just still sand everywhere. I did my best to sort of brush off, but you know what they say about sand! It\u0026rsquo;s coarse and it\u0026rsquo;s irritating and it gets everywhere. And sitting in the pilot seat is, like, uncomfortable and it– I don\u0026rsquo;t like the feel of the– my grip on the controls feels gritty and wrong and I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to get it away. And it\u0026rsquo;s just all very overstimulating and uncomfortable.\nAnd the desert transitions into a different type of desert. It goes from sand desert, slowly, to snow desert as I move up towards the poles of the planet. And then, suddenly, it\u0026rsquo;s open water. And the wind\u0026rsquo;s a little worse here. I think I should probably go up into the atmosphere, like I should– I should get higher to avoid some of the planetary interference, but I am worried that– as soon as I start to do that, the signal starts to dissipate, because it\u0026rsquo;s quite weak. And so I\u0026rsquo;m worried that if I go up to make my flight easier, I will lose the signal and not be able to locate it again. So I stay, and it sucks.\nAnd I get there. I land on this glacier. And I find living beings.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t get too graphic, but I think that what I find is… not people. I find… animals. The equivalent of big, weird, space polar bears, you know, that obviously, the people I\u0026rsquo;m following or person I\u0026rsquo;m following– still not totally sure– were discovered by, at some point, and overpowered by. And it seems that the reason that this signal started broadcasting suddenly while sounding so strange is just that it is coming from a receiver that was inside someone\u0026rsquo;s suit that got… ripped open by the elements or by these animals. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s still room for there to be timey wimey shit in there, but that is definitely part of it.\nAnd… you know, luckily they\u0026rsquo;re all well-fed right now. They\u0026rsquo;re not as aggressive as our polar bears. They see me land and come out and they\u0026rsquo;re watching and they\u0026rsquo;re obviously not thrilled that I\u0026rsquo;m there and they\u0026rsquo;re territorial. But I\u0026rsquo;m able to observe. See that if it were in fact my companions here– maybe it wasn\u0026rsquo;t, maybe it was someone totally different– but whoever was here is not here anymore and they weren\u0026rsquo;t prepared to deal with these particular creatures. And I don\u0026rsquo;t stick around. I go and I discover one more thing.\nJESS: And I find it by \u0026ldquo;coming upon it suddenly.\u0026rdquo; I– I am– I seek out experiences of awe. Such as a six of diamonds, which is \u0026ldquo;on the snowy peak of a mountain,\u0026rdquo; there are \u0026ldquo;living beings.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m not going to find any plants or at least we\u0026rsquo;re not going to talk about it. And that\u0026rsquo;s going to make my character very sad. No, we are because animals eat plants, and so that\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;re doing. And so that\u0026rsquo;s– that\u0026rsquo;s my excuse to make my botanist happier, because she deserves it.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s on the snowy peak of a mountain and… this time it\u0026rsquo;s real snow, actual snow this time. Snow planet. And I love the idea of snow meerkats. Right? So– they, if I\u0026rsquo;m coming upon them suddenly, it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m trudging along in the snow and then they just like, boop! Boop. Boop! Boop. Just like all over this like field of snow on the cap of this mountain, just popping in and out. It\u0026rsquo;s like a half meter deep snow and they\u0026rsquo;re just, like, presumably burrowing under it and making tunnels and then just, like, sticking out their heads and looking at me and going down.\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out why they keep coming up. Is it just to like check on me, or could they feel that through the vibrations and the movement of the snow? And then one of them comes up just as this like insect comes buzzing by and they just like nab it.\nInsects aren\u0026rsquo;t plants. I lied. It\u0026rsquo;s more animals. And that\u0026rsquo;s what the card told me to do. So I\u0026rsquo;m following instructions.\nSo. They pop up and just, like, nab this little insect as it buzzes by, because, you know, snowy ground doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make for a lot of nutritious meals unless there\u0026rsquo;s snow plants, which my botanist would love to find out. But, uh, yeah. So I think they– they snack on whatever flies through the air and they\u0026rsquo;re kind of my constant company as I move on by. They\u0026rsquo;re– they never come close to me. They probably can detect my movement just like through the snow, very attuned to their environment. But any time an insect buzzes by, they just like, [Bloop-y suddenly appearing sound], and nab it and go right on back under. Um, and I do manage to snap a few photos of them, which I am very satisfied to have happen.\nAre- are these little gophers all I find here? I suppose they are. Well… I was delighted by them, both my character and myself, and so that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Big snow planet. There\u0026rsquo;s gophers, like, literally everywhere. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m behind schedule because I keep staying and writing about the life cycles of plants in a physical notebook. And so I\u0026rsquo;m like, big snow planet. Gophers, we got it. I\u0026rsquo;ll get back on schedule. That way they won\u0026rsquo;t yell at me. And I\u0026rsquo;ll do that by skipping the rest of snow planet where there\u0026rsquo;s no plants \u0026lsquo;cause it\u0026rsquo;s snowy.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] All right, a three means that it is something I \u0026ldquo;come upon suddenly.\u0026rdquo; That makes sense; it\u0026rsquo;s probably while I am beating a hasty retreat. [Card flipping] It is another living being, but deep underground this time.\nSo I think that the setup of this is that I… I do retreat. I get out of there and decide to like head- head off of this planet. But before I do that, I do need to find somewhere to just rinse off so that I\u0026rsquo;m not miserably uncomfortable, covered in sand and grit, as I\u0026rsquo;m traversing the skies and stars.\nAnd so I fly around and I\u0026rsquo;m looking for– I go back, away from the poles… [Big yawn] to where things are warmer. And it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, well, if there\u0026rsquo;s a big ocean up there, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a body of water that is warm.\u0026rdquo; Because I can\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to rinse off in the glacier, in the snow desert. I\u0026rsquo;ve done pretty well with survival so far, but why take the unnecessary risk of hypothermia?\nAnd… yeah, I just look for water and end up finding a signal of- of a series of underground caverns with underground rivers and all that kind of thing, somewhere in the desert. And I find a natural cave entrance that I can go into and head down there.\nAnd I find a living being… I think it\u0026rsquo;s something in the water as I\u0026rsquo;m bathing. And I think what I want this to do is remind me of the eels that I found? Those- those nocturnal eels.\nBecause I think part of this here is… I think this is the first time that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen solid evidence that the person I\u0026rsquo;m following could have died. It seems likely that they have probably died in some of those other crashes, or there\u0026rsquo;s a reason that tent was abandoned ,they didn\u0026rsquo;t come back to it. But I was always able to believe maybe the reason that they\u0026rsquo;re able to keep going in this loop is because they do get out and then they reset themself in some way. And this is forcing me to confront like, I mean, have they died over and over and over? Is that what\u0026rsquo;s happening here?\nOr did I just come to the end of the line? Was this the last one– did I not do it? Did I miss my chance? Was this– is this their real death? And- and anything I find in the future is further in the past than this one is. And getting that sense of despair and hopelessness. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m not good enough for this. I should go home. What\u0026rsquo;s the point?\nAnd I think these strange fish appear and I think it\u0026rsquo;s something like… I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of what– what a– what a– what a fish could be… doing. [Giggling]\nThe water changes temperature… notably… near them? Like, these fish come in from a stream and they start investigating my legs and they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re passive, and they\u0026rsquo;re curious. And I jump a little bit as they come closer to me because they are somehow carrying– I think at first they\u0026rsquo;re- they just must be carrying a cold draft, but actually, it seems like these fish generate cold. Or they absorb heat, I think is probably the way that– I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how thermodynamics works. Um.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s this small thing, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that, again, I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen before, and would have never had the reason to see if I\u0026rsquo;d stayed on my home planet. And I remind myself that this- this is part of it too. That I\u0026rsquo;m not just getting wrapped up in a big mystery, but this is also just… for me. And for my growth, and for my desire to see the things that the world has to offer. I don\u0026rsquo;t need an excuse dragging me forward through my life. I am allowed to just… want to see what is out there and want to see cool, new, weird things.\nAnd so… I hang out in the water for a little while longer until I\u0026rsquo;m feeling clean and I seal myself up in, like, a fresh vac suit… that I think there\u0026rsquo;s, you know– there\u0026rsquo;s a whole production of me pulling– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s like, sealed, vacuum sealed, still. And I bring it down into the cave and then open it there, ripping the plastic off and put it on, so that there\u0026rsquo;s– I don\u0026rsquo;t open it in the ship or out there so that sand could get in it. It is all fresh, no sand. And I put it on and feel super refreshed and ready to be less frustrated if I don\u0026rsquo;t find answers. Because that isn\u0026rsquo;t entirely what it\u0026rsquo;s about.\n[Cards being gathered thoughtfully]\nI want to preface that I\u0026rsquo;m not intending for that to be a reason that if I can\u0026rsquo;t find a way to wrap this up neatly in the next planet, because we are doing five planets… it wasn\u0026rsquo;t intentional that I am giving a thematic reason– like, ooh, the point of the story is that there\u0026rsquo;s no point of the story. But… if that\u0026rsquo;s what makes it work… isn\u0026rsquo;t it beautiful that that\u0026rsquo;s what the cards gave me? That that\u0026rsquo;s what the cards and the die and I created together? An excuse for the cards and the die and I to create together something that isn\u0026rsquo;t totally a cogent narrative? [Laughing] It\u0026rsquo;s games, baby! Forget it, Jack. It\u0026rsquo;s tabletop… town. Tab– table– it\u0026rsquo;s table– it\u0026rsquo;s game- it\u0026rsquo;s- gamers… [Sighs, softly:] Okay.\nGAME: PLANET FIVE DUSTY: I think from there, I am to go back to the planet I used to go to. At least I think I\u0026rsquo;m heading towards that planet. So let\u0026rsquo;s try… [Die rolling] I got three this time. [Cards being dealt] One, two, three.\nJESS: Okay, one last planet. And then maybe maybe she has to turn around and head home for a bit. [Die rolling] That is a four, so there are four things on this planet that we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about. [Cards being dealt]\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s see… so normally, this game, you kind of just go \u0026rsquo;til you\u0026rsquo;re done. Because of the podcast, there\u0026rsquo;s a limit here. And so there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit more weighing on this roll than there normally would be any given planet roll. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how much– I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m legitimately nervous. This is so funny. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s see. How much do I find on this last planet?\n[Die clattering] Three. Not bad. I was– I was genuinely scared that it would be a one.\nJESS: [Card flipping] And the first one I find… how much you want to bet that I\u0026rsquo;m going to come upon it suddenly? [Die rolling] No! Resting. We\u0026rsquo;re starting out with rest. It\u0026rsquo;s the end of, like, a very long mission, set of planets. And so I think- I think I\u0026rsquo;m wearing down a little bit.\nAnd so she comes upon, resting, a seven of diamonds. Lots of animal life on these ones. \u0026ldquo;Near a volcano.\u0026rdquo; Hot planet! Here we go.\nVolcano. And it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a living being near a volcano.\nOkay– I\u0026rsquo;m immediately… okay. You know how there\u0026rsquo;s, like, theories that life doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be carbon-based? And it could be based on another element? I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is right now. It\u0026rsquo;s something really toxic to us, I remember that. Cyanide? Sulfur? Whatever it is, there\u0026rsquo;s, like, theories about, like… what if other– life existed in the, like, bases of volcanoes, that was made of this other thing. I also think there\u0026rsquo;s an X-Files episode based on this speculation, um, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure it\u0026rsquo;s more than just X-Files.\nAnyway. It\u0026rsquo;s real. In this universe. And I know because she finds it.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s unexpected. I- I think she\u0026rsquo;s seen a lot of weird stuff in her travels, but. She does have a little microscope built into her suit, so she\u0026rsquo;s able to like, you know– she\u0026rsquo;s got like a– she\u0026rsquo;s got a sixth finger on her suit that is the tube of a microscope that she can use. Yeah, I love that.\nAnd so she\u0026rsquo;s, like, poking around in this lava, using the protection of her suit. And, like, in the coals, and she\u0026rsquo;s zooming in, and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Wait, that\u0026rsquo;s not mineral. That\u0026rsquo;s a cell. But that\u0026rsquo;s not–\u0026rdquo; She, like, goes in closer, because these microscopes are fine enough to see atoms. It\u0026rsquo;s sci-fi. We\u0026rsquo;re good. We can fit that on her– on her suit. She\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not carbon. Cool!\u0026rdquo; Even if it\u0026rsquo;s– even if it\u0026rsquo;s a thing that happens, it\u0026rsquo;s, like, really cool to run into and find.\nAnd this one– it\u0026rsquo;s probably unique. Every planet, you never know what you\u0026rsquo;re going to find. And so even though it\u0026rsquo;s like single celled, it is single celled of a different type of cell. And that\u0026rsquo;s so cool to her.\nDUSTY: And… uh, five. So! Another deal while I\u0026rsquo;m resting, which I think is just a continuation of where I was. I\u0026rsquo;m still heading towards this planet that\u0026rsquo;s not called home, but might as well be my cousin\u0026rsquo;s house. Family that is not too familiar, but enough to share a drink with.\nAnd I see another blip on the radar where there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be. And I stop, and the wanderer, the curiosity in me, immediately begins to fight with the logical side, where the past couple of planets I just discovered near this sector have been nightmares brought to life. Do I really want to discover more? But then if it\u0026rsquo;s undiscovered, who\u0026rsquo;s going to put it there so no one finds it? And this goes back and forth, until the curious side of me is the one sitting in the cockpit as I descend upon this new planet.\nAnd as I get closer I see that it\u0026rsquo;s not too different than the ones I\u0026rsquo;ve seen before, but definitely– you can see why no one has visited, as it seems to be constantly moving, as if there\u0026rsquo;s something happening on the surface, or even above the surface, incredibly fast.\nBut what I find upon first… queen of clubs. So \u0026ldquo;in deep water,\u0026rdquo; I see another \u0026ldquo;plant or immobile forms of life.\u0026rdquo;\nThe water of this planet is actually what\u0026rsquo;s closer to the surface. The gravity, the geography, the geological currents or what have you, have ended up with the sky and the water have been replaced. So as we\u0026rsquo;re approaching, I have to quickly set my ship to be submerged, to put all its water- uh, water safeties on before it starts flooding. And I do that just before we actually enter.\nAnd when we enter, the water behaves differently. You see that it\u0026rsquo;s recognized molecularly, and by the systems as water– it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be causing any issues, as if we just filled into liquid nitrogen or something. But it\u0026rsquo;s sluggish. The ship which I was entering atmosphere almost doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a full stop. But I rapidly de-accelerate it. I see that the buffers for that on my ship are straining and I decide to kind of slow down, as fast as I can without causing damage to the ship, or myself on the inside.\nAnd I see that as I go closer, I\u0026rsquo;m seeing, now, huge bodies that are akin trees. And I see that, if I look back, they go almost back to the surface of where I entered. But am I getting closer to them or just seeing them as I go? And they seem to be seaweed or something equivalent. These leafy kelp materia… plant life… kind of swaying, but enough have been gathered where they\u0026rsquo;re as thick as tree trunks.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m flying through I see that they go all the way… down? Up? It\u0026rsquo;s hard to say when you\u0026rsquo;ve entered the planet through its water. But they reach all the way through before you kind of blast through to the other side. And you see that these seaweed, these kelp, these underwater trees, are kind of swaying, almost as if there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of tentacles floating from the sky down to the surface. Which is an incredible yet terrifying visual.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s see how much more relaxing I do on this journey, huh? The first thing I discover… [Die clatter] is arduous to get to. Alright. It is a ten of clubs. Clubs are \u0026ldquo;plants and other immobile forms of life\u0026rdquo; and ten is \u0026ldquo;on a cliff face.\u0026rdquo;\nI think that part of what it is here is just that… this being the very first thing that I discover, I think… it\u0026rsquo;s just a really bad flight. And landing. I think– I\u0026rsquo;m starting to remember, you know, when I left, the person at the garage warned me that this p– ship– I keep wanting to say plane, which like I guess, but not– it loses a bit of the drama.\nI was warned that this ship is meant to be for relatively short journeys, or rather, it\u0026rsquo;s meant to travel a lot, but it is meant to stop frequently in between legs of the journey, somewhere that it can get some maintenance. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been pushing it. Able to extend it a little bit just because I have enough experience in manual labor and that sort of stuff that there are basic repairs that I can make, but it is definitely getting past what I can do.\nAnd so the flight is just unpleasant. The controls haven\u0026rsquo;t totally recovered from what was going on on the sand planet. It is disorienting. They need to like reset their like– their baseline is all fucked up. There is still sand in some places in the ship, though I- I- I stay in my vac suit for now, as I\u0026rsquo;m– and probably pull out a vacuum, and I\u0026rsquo;m trying to clean it up.\nAnd then… it\u0026rsquo;s just an unpleasant landing. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to find somewhere to put down because my sensors are acting up, and so I don\u0026rsquo;t totally know if I\u0026rsquo;ll be landing in a super safe spot, or what I\u0026rsquo;ll find there; I just kind of have to put down at this point. And so I find that\u0026rsquo;s somewhere relatively high up, shorter distance for me to go from space. I\u0026rsquo;m on top of this cliff. And I find plants or other immobile forms of life.\nWhat is it?\nRoll out of the ship with sort of the distinct vibe of being in a fight? But it\u0026rsquo;s with the ship? And I\u0026rsquo;m setting up my… tent. Like I\u0026rsquo;m like, I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t care what happens. I need to spend a night outside of that ship because it\u0026rsquo;s driving me nuts.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m setting up my tent. And– I- I test the ground to see– you know, can I- can I secure the tent to this or do I have to use… I\u0026rsquo;m sure that the tent has artificial… has- has ways of being secured to many different types of ground because it\u0026rsquo;s meant to be for different, like interplanetary– [Stumbles over the word a couple of times] interplanetary exploration. So it can be on rocks and in dirt and whatever.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m testing the ground… ooh. And I think… I think that I landed on a rock cliff, and I start poking at the ground to see which secure, uh spikes– which– what- what level of spikes I need to pull out in order to secure it into this ground. And I realise it\u0026rsquo;s soft. It\u0026rsquo;s very soft.\nAnd I keep probing at it and analysing it a little bit. And I realise that– I\u0026rsquo;m looking around and it looks to me like I am on this big semi-mountainous region with these big sheer slate cliff faces going down into an ocean. And it dawns on me as I\u0026rsquo;m poking around at this ground that this is not inorganic material at all. I have landed on a huge plant of some kind. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like– the texture I have in my mind is very thick moss, but a little more solid than that in the middle. And it\u0026rsquo;s hard enough that it could feel like rock with moss growing on it when you first land on it. But as you apply different types of pressure, it\u0026rsquo;s non-Newtonian, or whatever. And I realise that this big cliff that I\u0026rsquo;m on is a giant growth out of this ocean. And all of the cliffs around me are not land. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like a big, weird above-water-level coral reef that just looks exactly like a bunch of, uh, shale and granite and whatever.\nAnd so… it\u0026rsquo;s great, because it\u0026rsquo;s actually very easy to secure my tent here!\nJESS: [Die rolling] And… the next one is also while we\u0026rsquo;re resting.\nI kind of lost the resting with the coals, didn\u0026rsquo;t I? Why was she resting at a bunch of coals? It\u0026rsquo;s done. We did it. She was supposed to be resting; she\u0026rsquo;s like, mandatory rest period, but she has more that she wants to see before she go home. So it was actually that she was supposed to be resting.\nThis time she is resting. She overworked herself a little bit. And so… she finds… \u0026ldquo;by a gentle river,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;living beings.\u0026rdquo; Is she not going to get any more plants? Did we draw all the plants already? She\u0026rsquo;s going to be very sad about the end of her journey if so.\nSo three of diamonds. It\u0026rsquo;s by a gentle river, which is of course on this planet, a gentle river of lava. And so there\u0026rsquo;s just this slow lava flow. And so far, the only signs of life have been these single celled organisms that I identified in the, like, embers of hot rock.\nAnd then I see movement, faster than the current of the- the lava flow. And I start to realise… is there something alive in there? Then I see something resembling, like, a fin. And I stop. And I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m not moving on. I\u0026rsquo;m not- not until I know more about this. Is it alive in the lava? She does see a lot; this isn\u0026rsquo;t the strangest thing she\u0026rsquo;d ever see. But it\u0026rsquo;s a difficult environment for life, no matter what your foundational element is.\nSo she sets up and hides herself a little bit and activates her camera. And then… it crests. I\u0026rsquo;m imagining like a– like an armadillo but with a spine, kind of like a brontosaurus. They have, like, just, like, a few spines on their back, right? Regardless, that\u0026rsquo;s what she saw earlier, and then it crests and does this little, like, squirmy dive up and down. And whatever it is, its natural environment is the lava.\nShe wonders, is it like a whale that has to, like, come up? Is it coming up to get something from the air that it needs for sustaining itself? Or is this like a fish? Like, can this thing survive in the lava? Does it get what it needs from either the lava alone or other creatures in the lava?\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s the thing. For all the high quality science fiction equipment that she brought with her, none of it is going to survive being submerged in that lava enough to make meaningful observations. So whatever\u0026rsquo;s going on under there will always be a mystery. But she\u0026rsquo;s trying to learn to appreciate that.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] The next thing is something that I come upon suddenly. [Card flipping] And it is a six of spades. So spades are natural phenomena and six is on the snowy peak of a mountain.\nHmm… so I think– I stay the night on the weird cliff and then the next day… I get to– \u0026ldquo;stay the night,\u0026rdquo; I say in air quotes, because I think my night and day cycles are probably pretty random at this point. But I get some sleep in the tent and then I pack up. And… I pat the outside of the ship grudgingly like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, I took some time. I\u0026rsquo;m not mad at you anymore. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. We\u0026rsquo;ve just been spending too much time together.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I head out to explore, to see if I find a ship.\nAnd I think for some– I- I- I am immediately thinking, like, very simply that this is just a planet where rocks and plants have switched places. [Laughing] Which… sounds so stupid. But… I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that the natural phenomena I find is that… I\u0026rsquo;m flying and… yeah, there\u0026rsquo;s this mountain, this snowy peak mountain. And I think that I see– for the first time– because the rest of this planet, I quickly realise, the plant life on it is all huge. There aren\u0026rsquo;t flowers, there aren\u0026rsquo;t trees, there isn\u0026rsquo;t even really grass or anything. It is all just those huge cliff-sized growths.\nAnd at a certain point, I see trees. And I\u0026rsquo;m curious. I want to know, what are the circumstances in which trees grow here? And head towards this mountain.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not literally \u0026ldquo;rocks and plants have swapped places,\u0026rdquo; because I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what that means, but it is… the thing I thought were trees is a rock formation. And maybe it is– I think the impression I get… it\u0026rsquo;s almost like they are stalactites and stalagmites, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how they could have grown because there\u0026rsquo;s no ceiling? And so my best guess is just that there\u0026rsquo;s been some sort of major change in this– how this– in the environment of this planet, where it used to… be somehow in a form that this could be created here. These huge stiff rock forms that branch out. They look like naked trees, you know; we\u0026rsquo;re in the snow, there\u0026rsquo;s frost and snow forming on them. They don\u0026rsquo;t have leaves or anything. They just look like huge tree trunks and boughs reaching out to touch each other.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s the other thing I realise: they are all touching each other. And I have no idea how these could have formed here, but it\u0026rsquo;s this beautiful petrified forest, sitting on top of– again, one of those big plant growths that is this land. I think even sinking into it a little bit. I\u0026rsquo;m staring at the- the base and wondering what this is going to look like in a hundred years, two hundred years, three hundred years, because it looks like… especially as snow falls on it and extra weight gets added, more stuff calcifies, whatever… it\u0026rsquo;s pressing into the earth. Air quotes \u0026ldquo;earth.\u0026rdquo; This plant. And I wonder if it will all just fall through at some point. If that\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons that this place looks mostly so flat, is that things do land on the surface, but ultimately break through, and then… because the ground is alive, it is a plant, it just grows back over it.\nAnd, of course, I have to wonder if that\u0026rsquo;s happened to a ship. Of a person in a time loop. That I am following. And I have to wonder if my searches here are maybe fruitless, and what I\u0026rsquo;ve missed, even on other planets, because the elements have taken… nature has- has stripped clues away. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve been leaving notes, but they were on old-fashioned paper and degraded. And it\u0026rsquo;s just a reminder that there\u0026rsquo;s so much I don\u0026rsquo;t know. There\u0026rsquo;s so much I could be missing.\nAnd I think what it does is just strengthen the realisation I had on the last planet of like, I can\u0026rsquo;t do this for this mystery. I have to just… I have to find joy in the journey. And… that has to be the thing that I do on purpose. The exploration has to be the thing that I do on purpose, and the other stuff can happen to me. I have to pursue the thing that I can pursue. And that is possible and consistent. And extra things that happen that are out of my control are just a bonus on top. And not the thing that I should be basing everything on.\nDUSTY: What else do I find? [Card flipping] So. Diamonds are \u0026ldquo;living beings\u0026rdquo; and nine is \u0026ldquo;deep underground.\u0026rdquo;\nI think… this journey that I\u0026rsquo;m coming through as I descend from this water down to the surface… it\u0026rsquo;s really– it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell what\u0026rsquo;s happening, as there is air between where I am, but it almost feels like the whole earth is inverted, almost? That this empty pocket of air is leading me towards sediment and rock and all that.\nAnd I am met with almost a solid sheet of rock, of mountain. It seems that… that there is this water layer, then there\u0026rsquo;s this. And I see that there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of tunnels and things to venture towards. So I decide to pick one and go.\nAnd these tunnels go winding and forward and forward. It seems barren, and then you keep going and going and going. And it feels like I\u0026rsquo;ve been through this rock and underground for an hour, or– even though I check and it\u0026rsquo;s been ten minutes.\nAnd I see more natural light, and come out the other side from… almost a volcano? But it\u0026rsquo;s… it\u0026rsquo;s a hollow mountain; that\u0026rsquo;s where I fly out from. And though I\u0026rsquo;ve been driving through rock and sediment and the crust of what would normally be first, I\u0026rsquo;m met with kind of a green oasis.\nAnd… there are humanoids, at least, that look here, that see my ship. And it seems to be a small village or something. A city. Not huge, but there\u0026rsquo;s definitely at least a dozen plus different kinds of buildings. So I land just outside of it, and I see… one of them run up to me. Not threateningly. But they go up to ask some questions. And they look strikingly similar to me, to other humans I see, that colonised all these planets.\nAnd they start talking about how they\u0026rsquo;ve never met anyone off planet. How they\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a ship like mine before. Was it hard to get here? How did you get here? And as I\u0026rsquo;m explaining the situation, I see that their face becomes… both interested, and then it gets\u0026hellip; not dour, but… concerned? Confused? As they hear all that I\u0026rsquo;m saying, and their eyebrow furrows, and they explain back to me how that can\u0026rsquo;t be true. That\u0026rsquo;s not how they were taught about this planet. They were told that this planet was just– you go through the paths, you go through these caves. The water, the endless ocean, does not exist. It\u0026rsquo;s only a fairy tale.\nAnd you see they\u0026rsquo;re furrowed, and they run back to the town and start speaking with people. And then you hear their voices get louder, and more people are running towards them and you see them pointing at you. And I decide this feels like it\u0026rsquo;s breaking bad. And I was telling them information that they maybe shouldn\u0026rsquo;t know or did not know and were lied to their whole life. So I get back into my ship and I fly off. And as I\u0026rsquo;m starting to lift off, I see some of these people running towards me, and then I decide this is not my place, or my story to tell. So I run off.\nJESS: \u0026lsquo;Kay. How about the next thing? \u0026ldquo;Arduous to get to,\u0026rdquo; makes sense. She\u0026rsquo;s scaling a volcano.\nI lost the resting thing again. I just get really excited about what I find. She– she was resting this time and that\u0026rsquo;s why she was sort of taken by surprise, right? She\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, nice little gentle lava flow. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of relaxing. And then she, like, sees the spine crest and she\u0026rsquo;s like, hey, what? Hey, okay, cool. Let\u0026rsquo;s go hide somewhere and just set up a camera and I can justify it to anyone who\u0026rsquo;s reading my mission logs, because I was supposed to be resting, and I stayed in one place. Even if I was working.\u0026rdquo; I know that logic. It\u0026rsquo;s very familiar to me.\nAnyway. This one\u0026rsquo;s arduous to get to. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out what it is. [Card flipping] Five of clubs! [Chanting] Plant life, plant life, immobile forms of life.\nAnd a five is in a treetop. We got trees on lava planet? You got trees on your planet? Are we interpretive, or are they actual…\nI think. That… so, we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about how we\u0026rsquo;ve got an alternate, like, atomic base for life here. We\u0026rsquo;ve talked about it with animal life, but not with plant life. And there is a tree made up of… I don\u0026rsquo;t know, cyanide? Whatever it is that it\u0026rsquo;s actually theorised. That one.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s bizarre in its colouration, and it\u0026rsquo;s bizarre in its texture. But some of the basic forms of it, the trunk, the branching… something that looks almost more like solar paneling, as if it like grew these glass and metal panels in something that resembles leaves, is just standing near the very top of, like, a volcano peak that I\u0026rsquo;ve been climbing. With those panels pointed towards the sky. And whether one could call it a plant really depends on how you define plant, but… she\u0026rsquo;s a botanist. She knows a tree when she sees a tree. Presumably those panels seem like they might even be doing, you know, some equivalent of photosynthesis. This is a tree. And that\u0026rsquo;s so cool.\nAnd this is where she really has to like, make herself– oh, no, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t manage it. She stays. She fought to get up to the top of this peak and she needs to know everything about this tree. And she like takes a leaf as a sample in like a little hard container, and like microscopes it to all hell.\nAnd, um, this is just so, so cool. Like… I think this is some of the most that she\u0026rsquo;s ever found something that is so distinctly… not of life as she knows it, and yet taking on such an analogous form. A tree that is in no cellular respects a tree. But… a tree.\nAnd she camps that night under that tree at the tip of this volcano, but. Nothing is wrenching her away from that tree until she\u0026rsquo;s had more time with it.\nAnd then she has one more thing to find on this planet before she finishes her mission.\nDUSTY: Pulling my last card… which is the two of hearts. More \u0026ldquo;ruins\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a very ruinous journey. So I find more ruins \u0026ldquo;under the light of the moon or moons.\u0026rdquo;\nI think how this goes is that I decided to slide back through this hollow mountain, and the cave structure, using the– just my previous coordinates to go the right way. And then I get back to that huge slat, that layer of earth between the air and this ocean, or the endless ocean as that person described it to me, and decide to just travel along it to see what I could find.\nAnd as I\u0026rsquo;m doing so, I see that this layer of sediment of the rock, of this whole mountainside, encompasses the entire planet. It\u0026rsquo;s not a huge planet by any means, but… I fly at high speeds for maybe about an hour, and I end up at the same coordinates. Not found any breaking of land. It\u0026rsquo;s just all these caves and tunnels going downward.\nI try a different direction, just to be sure. And then from there, I finally see something popping up… or down. My perspective is really, truly out of sorts here.\nAnd… I see the structure…. the only thing I could describe it from visual is a- a temple. And when I get there, I see that there is… craggy rocks near what should be, um, stairs. And that\u0026rsquo;s when I fully gather that whatever sun or light source there was has been replaced, as it does get… it\u0026rsquo;s hard to really say, because all the light is entering through this water. So it gets darkER? And it\u0026rsquo;s replaced with a different kind of light, where instead– I was getting the warm yellow of the sun nearby, and now it\u0026rsquo;s this kind of shimmering white from the moonlight reflected off this twin moons that are rotating across this planet, causing almost double shadows, as they are just far enough where if you\u0026rsquo;re standing in the right spot, you see two shadows coming off, at different angles. And those shadows get larger and larger as I ascend this crumbling temple.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s structured almost as if a tiered pyramid, almost, but not quite– it\u0026rsquo;s not as pointy. And I see, towards the top, it\u0026rsquo;s a room that sits maybe twenty feet by twenty feet with a door on either side, seemingly, that you could enter from the other side of this temple. And a hole in the ceiling to let light through.\nAnd you see… on the table, this pedestal, this monument there, is… not a book. It\u0026rsquo;s written words, but it\u0026rsquo;s on a page longer than would fit in a normal book, with handles almost, as if you could roll it up. And on it, I read, um in a language that I can actually understand, about what happened here. That the planet was actually never supposed to be like this. That there was something dangerous coming down here and… the scientists and mages– not sure what they mean by mages– the scientists and mages of this planet did a ceremony of sorts to… turn it to how it was, so that whatever entered from the endless ocean would not destroy life as we know it. And it\u0026rsquo;s written, at the end, with great condolences and the name of about seven or eight people.\nAnd the moonlight shines right onto it. This ink, almost… luminescent, glowing in all these prismatic colors as the moonlight hits it.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s sign enough for me where… I decide I should go again. This is definitely not my place. And if the endless ocean is what I came through, I again do not want to know what\u0026rsquo;s out there causing them to be concerned enough to change a whole entire future generation\u0026rsquo;s way of life.\nSo I get in my old trusty ship and head out. And decide I do need to go to a place I know, at least for once. I set the settings to go through the water and change it as I leave the atmosphere and go to space, and decide to head home, and… or, close to home as one could be. And get a strong drink. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve had enough excitement for a few lifetimes.\nIn my log, uh… I just name this planet Inverse. That\u0026rsquo;s what it is.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more delighted to announce… that the last thing I find… is something I spot… while I am resting. It is so correct to me that the last card of this game is a card in which you should not at me, because I am. Saturday. Chilling.\nDear god, I hope that people know that meme. I never know when something was in Tumblr containment. Because it was my everything.\nAnd it is… [Deep inhale] a jack of clubs. Oh. [Thump of hand hitting chest] Part of me was thinking maybe… a ruin, or a person, but nope. \u0026ldquo;Plant or other immobile form of life\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;in the desert.\u0026rdquo;\nWell, what on earth… is a desert. On the planet that I\u0026rsquo;ve been describing so far? What is the definition of a desert? [Typing] So if it\u0026rsquo;s little precipitation… maybe this is…\nI was thinking about like quote unquote \u0026ldquo;cheating\u0026rdquo; and going up onto the moon of this planet. I think I am actually going to do that, because I think… I like the idea that this planet is entirely these plants. And there are those big rock formations. I guess… I could just find a really big rock formation and have that basically be a desert. Sure.\nSo, out of curiosity of how these big tree-looking rocks came to be, I start investigating, and I find a huge stretch of rock and land on it. And I sort of peter around, I tinker at it. I take a couple samples, but there\u0026rsquo;s not much I can do with them. I\u0026rsquo;m not, like, a biologist, or a scientist in any way. I can\u0026rsquo;t really study things. There\u0026rsquo;s stuff in the ship. I can plug samples into the ship and it can spit out what molecules and elements are in it, and I can get some amount of understanding from that, but not very much. And… so I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t really learn anything, but… and I think that\u0026rsquo;s a little annoying to me at first, but then I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m doing– I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m looking for answers again. I should just enjoy this big, weird stretch of land.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all– I think it\u0026rsquo;s very smooth. The image that I\u0026rsquo;m getting is, you know how stalactites and stalagmites often– they have that almost eroded look, because they\u0026rsquo;re formed with those slow drips and whatever? And so, this whole stretch of rock is very smooth. It looks like it was eroded. Part of me wonders if maybe significantly more of this planet used to be underwater and that\u0026rsquo;s how a lot of this happened. But I don\u0026rsquo;t know because I\u0026rsquo;m not a scientist.\nBut I… decide to just chill out on this stretch of land for a little while longer. [Yawning] And I see plants and other immobile forms of life.\nI am going to massage this slightly. Just because… I think probably this is supposed to very much be naturally occurring. But the thing I find while I\u0026rsquo;m on this, like, a meandering useless walk, stretching my legs before I get back into my ship… is a little farm- portable farm thing. It\u0026rsquo;s– I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of– in No Man\u0026rsquo;s Sky, you can build these farming stations. So it\u0026rsquo;s not like it\u0026rsquo;s terraformed, but it\u0026rsquo;s– I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s essentially like… it\u0026rsquo;s a tiny portable greenhouse, the size of like, a medium garden pot, that is– it\u0026rsquo;s the type of thing that you do as an experiment so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to commit a full crop to seeing if you can successfully grow something, even in artificial conditions, on a planet.\nI see this– in a dip in the desert rock, nestled down, in a little bit of shadow– this series of pots with that company logo on them, the company of the ship that I\u0026rsquo;ve been following, the captain I\u0026rsquo;ve been following.\nAnd the first ones that I see are dead. Obviously very old. And I\u0026rsquo;m curious and I keep walking down the line, and there are a lot of them. And they\u0026rsquo;re different, too– they\u0026rsquo;re different types of plants, like this really was an experiment to see what would grow here.\nAnd I keep walking. And I stop. Because one of them is just starting to push up into the air, a fresh bud. This has to have been planted within the past couple weeks. And I turn on the radio… and I don\u0026rsquo;t hear anything… and I look around, there\u0026rsquo;s no ship in the sky. I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen evidence of another person. And I think, \u0026ldquo;Oh, this one\u0026rsquo;s– this is the most recent thing I\u0026rsquo;ve seen. I should wait. I should stay here. My ship is flying poorly anyway; I should just stay. I can stay, and I can wait, because maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll come back.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I catch myself and I pull out my little card with the radio signal that says \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m right behind you.\u0026rdquo; And I hand draw on a little smiley face or a heart or something, and I stick it on the youngest looking plant. And I go back to my ship. And I take off. \u0026lsquo;Cause I\u0026rsquo;m not going to just wait here for this mysterious pilot that I\u0026rsquo;m chasing to come and answer all of my questions for me. I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep living my life and exploring and finding new things. And if this is truly… destiny. If this is fated, like I\u0026rsquo;ve believed a number of times over this journey, it\u0026rsquo;ll happen when it needs to happen.\nJESS: And she comes upon it resting. She\u0026rsquo;s tired. Even after the time spent with this tree. It\u0026rsquo;s been a long planet, a long mission. And I think it probably happens while she\u0026rsquo;s sleeping at the base of this tree. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out though. What is it? [Card flipping] A jack of hearts. We\u0026rsquo;re back in the desert. This is the last jack. \u0026ldquo;In the desert.\u0026rdquo; Volcano can be desert? Question mark? Hearts. \u0026ldquo;Ruins.\u0026rdquo; Ruins! This is only my second ruins! Only my second heart. Randomness is cool.\nThe very last thing she finds.\nShe wakes in the morning. And… the… the leaves, the- the solar panel leaves, they turn to track the sun. And because of that, one of them had sort of been hiding the other. Like she\u0026rsquo;d been inspecting one leaf really deeply, but it\u0026rsquo;s not like she looked at every leaf close up. And so one of them was sort of obscured by the other, but when it rotates, when she wakes, she just looks above her.\nAnd… maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t shed leaves. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t know. She\u0026rsquo;ll never know. But maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t- they don\u0026rsquo;t have like a fall spring cycle. It\u0026rsquo;s much more long-term, these strange cyanide trees.\nAnd so… the carvings on the bottom of the leaf are still there. Who knows how long those have been there, but they look unlike anything else she\u0026rsquo;s seen. And they don\u0026rsquo;t look like the sort of naturally forming patterns that are on the tree\u0026rsquo;s texture itself. It could be– she can\u0026rsquo;t really know, but something in her, the botanist in her says those were carved there intentionally.\nTwo symbols. And one connecting it.\nDUSTY: Set my coordinates to the one planet I know. I lock them, so that you don\u0026rsquo;t get changed accidentally and decide to take a good long nap.\nSATAH: I think about going home to check in with my friend in the garage, and having them repair the ship. And then, instead, I just… mostly, as I\u0026rsquo;ve been navigating, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using the data we took off of that first ship? And for the first time, I close that, and I pull up a local star system map that I can find just pingin\u0026rsquo; around on the radio- the radio waves.\nAnd I look up a settlement. Or a station. Somewhere I can find to land and get my ship looked at and put in a best shape again, so that I can keep going without putting myself in danger. And I plot a course to it.\nJESS: Did someone fall in love at the base of this tree? Did someone climb it and carve their initials into one of these panels? Did they– did they have initials? Why the panel… and not the trunk? Is it a custom? Does the trunk shed?\nA thousand questions go through her mind the moment she wakes up and looks up and see these carvings, these symbols.\nShe\u0026rsquo;ll keep those questions with her. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t write them down. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t note them in her journal. That\u0026rsquo;s not what she\u0026rsquo;s been sent out here to do. She\u0026rsquo;ll have a photo of the carvings, and she\u0026rsquo;ll have her questions inside her; thousands of them, every time she goes out on a trip like this.\nAnd maybe someday, she\u0026rsquo;ll read a paper from a scientist who followed her. And they\u0026rsquo;ll explain, they\u0026rsquo;ll answer, one of those questions, but… never all of them. Probably not this one.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s something really fun about that, you know?\nSATAH: [Cards being gathered] And that\u0026rsquo;s… that\u0026rsquo;s my journey! Thanks for… thanks for joining me.\nDUSTY: That was my space journeys.\nS\u0026rsquo;fun game! I really enjoyed how both simple, but really, like, evocative all of these prompts were. All of these planets were just off the cuff, but I would definitely– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna steal some of these for my own projects, for my own ideas.\nI– I like world building stuff, so this is just a perfect game for me.

LOVE. DIE. REMEMBER. 01 INTRO SATAH: Welcome to Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah, and my goal is to showcase multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together. You can support the show financially at patreon.com/foliopod, or join as a free member to get access to the bonus podcast feed. This month, patrons voted for me to stream My Welcomed Guest, a game by Dawn Bear Games about bargaining your way out of the fey world. Sign up at any paid tier now to see the VOD of that before its public release next month.\nThis is episode one of our games of Live. Love. Die. Remember., a game about \u0026ldquo;mechs falling in love with their pilots, reliving their memories of love before the end, and the cost of victory\u0026rdquo; by Ray Cox. It is a product of 2019\u0026rsquo;s emotional mecha jam, and it… [Laughing] uh, blows that concept out of the water? Uh– apologies for something that feels like, close to clickbait somehow– it is true, but it still feels like something I would put in the YouTube video title to sort of exaggerate its presence in the game– but it- but! You will- you will literally hear one of the guests cry a little. So.\nSpeaking of guests! The other yearning artificial intelligences embodied by a hunk of steel joining me are Brianna Price and Dora Rogers. I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you a little bit more about them and some stuff that they\u0026rsquo;ve got going on at the break.\nIn Live. Love. Die. Remember. you play a sapient mech who is in love with their pilot, recalling key moments of your relationship before you decide the fate of your final battle. We\u0026rsquo;re going to get started by setting up the big picture circumstances that lead up to that battle.\nGAME: DESCRIBE THE WAR SATAH: So.\nDEE: Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s go. Mechs, mechs, mechs.\nBRIANNA: Hi, folks! Um, my name is Brianna. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be playing Live. Love. Die. Remember. for Folio.\nDEE: So I\u0026rsquo;ve got Live. Love. Die. Remember. up.\nSATAH: Today I\u0026rsquo;m going to be playing through Live. Love. Die. Remember. which is a game from the emotional mecha jam a few years ago. Shout out to that jam for bringing, like, truly an absurd number of cool games into existence.\nDEE: I play a lot of games journal-style. Well– because I\u0026rsquo;m extra, I will basically write full stories about whatever\u0026rsquo;s going on, either in the form of in-character journal entries or sometimes just sort of like a prose, you know, account of what\u0026rsquo;s happening to my character. For this, since I\u0026rsquo;m specifically creating audio recording, I plan on mostly doing that, but I wanted to have a doc up to keep notes.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got a physical die because those can be fun sometimes, although I might also use dice rollers online, which is actually what I most often do.\nUm, and I\u0026rsquo;m good to go! I also have coffee, so I\u0026rsquo;m all set.\nSATAH: This game can be played with multiple people. It\u0026rsquo;s described as I believe one to four players. Obviously… gonna be sticking with one for this particular podcast. But if it intrigues you but you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more of a group experience, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of cool.\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll need some dice, some scraps of paper, something to write with, something to mark your skin!\u0026rdquo; I forgot something to mark my skin. I\u0026rsquo;ll get that in a moment. \u0026ldquo;I recommend permanent marker or eyeliner. Both will come off of your hand with hand sanitizer.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: Um, until reading this, I did not know that I was going to be marking my skin. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a really cool idea for a game.\nDEE: I have got black eyeliner and I\u0026rsquo;m excited.\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;Whenever you see a table, you can choose a random prompt, select a specific prompt, or have someone pick a prompt for you.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll just go for \u0026rsquo;em.\nDEE: There are tables and I can choose or choose randomly. I will decide what to do in the moment for those.\nSATAH: Me being me, obviously I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll.\nDEE: One thing that I love about solo TTRPGs is that I think I do a lot of self-censorship in non-solo TTRPGs. Mostly in the sense of not being self-indulgent– like, it\u0026rsquo;s not like I want to do really extreme stuff or anything, but I just want to be really self-indulgent sometimes and I have a lot of trouble doing that in group games. So I\u0026rsquo;m excited for that.\nSATAH: So the first section is \u0026ldquo;Describe the war.\u0026rdquo;\nALL THREE: \u0026ldquo;A final battle.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;A decision to make.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What will you sacrifice to make it through?\u0026rdquo;\n**DEE: \u0026ldquo;**Your love?\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;Your life?\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Or peace itself?\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;Gonna take a moment to build a little bit of the world we\u0026rsquo;re playing in.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;Just enough to get you started.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;We want to leave plenty of room to establish things as we play out our mech\u0026rsquo;s memories.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: We are going to do three questions.\nBRIANNA: Cool, cool cool cool. \u0026ldquo;Go into as much detail as you like. Give things names. Come up with technobabble, or leave it for your memories. Talk about the forces that led to the conflict, your creation, and why your pilot is with you.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s start off with the question, \u0026ldquo;this is a war\u0026rdquo; dot dot dot. So this is going to determine what the battle we\u0026rsquo;re fighting is.\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;This is a war… for national prestige, over resources, for the rights to control our world, for the future of our species, with no end, or for profit.\u0026rdquo; Mm. I always love to bring in cursed shit, but I actually think I want to start with something… \u0026lsquo;cause I think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting sometimes when there is a war that has some level of a good objective? So I\u0026rsquo;m going to say this is a war for– for the rights to control our world just compels me too much to go with anything else, because I think it\u0026rsquo;s so flexible in terms of like… is that good, is that bad? Well, we\u0026rsquo;ll see. It depends who else is trying to control the world.\nSATAH: And there are six options, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a D6. And I got a four, which is \u0026ldquo;for the future of our species.\u0026rdquo; I… don\u0026rsquo;t know if… I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll again and possibly choose another one \u0026lsquo;cause I don\u0026rsquo;t love that? I can make it work. If the die really wants me to do that, then I will.\nThat time I rolled a two: \u0026ldquo;over resources.\u0026rdquo; I am a little more comfortable exploring that. So this is a war over resources.\nDEE: Obviously this says a lot about tone. I\u0026rsquo;m like a Gundam girlie, um, which drives me in a certain direction. I feel like wars in Gundam, they\u0026rsquo;re always ostensibly over very petty things, right? So they always start about resources or national prestige. But then there\u0026rsquo;s always sort of like conspiracies within conspiracies or specific individuals who are fighting for something more for the future, I mean, I guess would be the most common thing.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s always sort of this– there\u0026rsquo;s usually a turn part way through where the war that\u0026rsquo;s over resources or for profit gets turned into a war for the future.\nWhere do I want to lean on this? Do I want… do I want a petty war or do I want a noble war? Or perhaps an ambiguously noble war? Gosh. Yeah, just where we are in 2025, I\u0026rsquo;m not feeling super optimistic about… noble wars. Just the nobility of power, I guess is a good way to put it.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to kind of combine two here. This is a war \u0026ldquo;with no end\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;for profit.\u0026rdquo; Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m going to hold off on saying more about that until I answer more questions. But this is a war with no end for profit. Because if the war doesn\u0026rsquo;t end, you keep profiting!\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What was I built for?\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;To test a new weapon system, to be a perfect machine for my pilot, to kill the enemy\u0026rsquo;s ace, to smash their fortress, to ensure our secrets stay hidden, to show the way forward.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: Yeah… a lot of good stuff here.\nBRIANNA: I think \u0026ldquo;to kill the enemy\u0026rsquo;s ace\u0026rdquo; is just so good.\nSATAH: Again, rolling a d6. I got a three. \u0026ldquo;To kill the enemy\u0026rsquo;s ace.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: The idea of this mech being like almost an assassination mech, where my purpose is specifically to kill one person or one potentially other person in a mech is just– is just fascinating to me.\nSATAH: So I am a mech that was constructed specifically to take out our opponent\u0026rsquo;s, like, top pilot. That\u0026rsquo;s great because it like… obviously, regardless, I\u0026rsquo;m playing a, uh, sentient weapon, but the specificity of that, the idea of having been designed specifically to take advantage of the weaknesses of one particular person… and probably ignoring a lot of other stuff? Like, you don\u0026rsquo;t need these type of tools, uh, because this is– this is your purpose. You are only going to fight this person. Like, the equivalent of, uh– \u0026ldquo;the enemy\u0026rsquo;s ace is only ever in space, like in– not on a planet– and so we\u0026rsquo;re just not going to give you landing gear,\u0026rdquo; that kind of thing. Probably not literally that, but there\u0026rsquo;s a great opportunity to build tension in there where it\u0026rsquo;s like, we didn\u0026rsquo;t give you things that you might need because you don\u0026rsquo;t need them, because that\u0026rsquo;s not what you\u0026rsquo;re designed for.\nDEE: Gosh, \u0026ldquo;to be a perfect machine for my pilot\u0026rdquo; is really tempting. I\u0026rsquo;m also drawn to \u0026ldquo;to smash their fortress.\u0026rdquo; The reason I like that is that, um… I like the idea of me being a blunt instrument that has taken on some sense of grace or beauty, at least for my pilot. Like this very big blocky, heavily armed thing that my pilot has nonetheless found a way to work with.\n\u0026ldquo;To be a perfect machine for my pilot\u0026rdquo; is really interesting because it includes this idea of service, right? If that\u0026rsquo;s what I was built for, then I\u0026rsquo;m going to be constantly trying to shape myself around this other person, which is really interesting.\nBut I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go with \u0026ldquo;to smash their fortress.\u0026rdquo;\nSo yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m definitely this like– I\u0026rsquo;m like massive, you know? Massive, blocky, all of this armor, and bristling with weapons.\nMy favourite– uh, okay. So my introduction to mecha was Gundam Wing. I\u0026rsquo;m a 90s kid. And my favourite Gundam– and I don\u0026rsquo;t know why– was always Heavyarms, which is this like, it\u0026rsquo;s got a big square chest. It\u0026rsquo;s got such garish colors. And um, it uh– one whole arm is like a gun, like a huge gatling gun, and its chest opens up and it just, like, missiles come from everywhere.\nSo I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of the vibe. That we\u0026rsquo;ve got this sort of like big square… this big square thing that\u0026rsquo;s really heavily armored and, um, like, ordinance comes from everywhere.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re not using lasers in this setting. And… I\u0026rsquo;m going to leave myself open to sort of like beam swords or other sort of melee weapons, but but- but this is not a, this is not that kind of mech. This is a mech that is very much about like, heavy ordinance. Like when my main cannon fires, like, huge shells pop out and, like, it\u0026rsquo;s– a lot of a lot of my firepower comes from missiles. Because yeah, I just- I just love the aesthetics of that, the physicality of it. So I\u0026rsquo;m this very physical being.\nI think that as a mech, I\u0026rsquo;m probably considered ugly by a lot of people. I\u0026rsquo;m not graceful. I\u0026rsquo;m not this sort of like, uh, dancer, this thing built for speed and maneuverability and dogfighting and intricate duels. Uh, I am this this big blocky thing that\u0026rsquo;s meant to charge in and take a lot of punishment and dish out a lot of punishment.\nOut of the factory, it\u0026rsquo;s like this incredibly dull, boring gray. Like, everything is gun metal gray, possibly with like black or darker gray detailing that was intended to create a sense of menace.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m picturing like– I\u0026rsquo;m picturing something very specific for the mech\u0026rsquo;s head that I wonder if I can convey. It\u0026rsquo;s like… it- it- it sort of has horns, but not like big Viking horns? I\u0026rsquo;m sort of picturing the demon Etrigan from DC. Let me see if that matches up. Yeah, yeah. So it\u0026rsquo;s sort of like like little horns on top of the head and like a, yeah, Etrigan has like a big square forehead, um… and like this sort of like this just like bare ugly head. Sorry, Etrigan. And he\u0026rsquo;s got like- got little horns. Um, so it\u0026rsquo;s that kind of look. I\u0026rsquo;m sure they serve some functional purpose and they\u0026rsquo;re ECCM or something.\nSATAH: And the third question is, \u0026ldquo;When you first met your pilot, what about them seized your attention?\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: As I said, this is a solo TTRPG. I get to be utterly self-indulgent here. Uh, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to be very gay for this person.\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;The way others swooned in their presence, the romance of their voice, their power to command the hearts of others…\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;How they rebelled, they saw the beauty in all things, the fire in their eyes, the violence in their heart, their mastery of the technical, the scars they carried with them.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: This is a ten– uh, oh, sorry. This is a nine item list. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a D10 and just discard a 10. And I rolled a nine, which is \u0026ldquo;the scars they carried with them.\u0026rdquo; I think that could be interesting. I am going to roll another one just to see if I find one to– like, if another one is more immediately compelling. Ha ha, 10. One more. Oh, one. \u0026ldquo;The way others swooned in their presence.\u0026rdquo; Okay.\nWhich one of those– the thing that\u0026rsquo;s fun about that is that in some ways, like, that could be exploring a very similar thing, right? It\u0026rsquo;s like a- a history and a reputation.\nI think given the– given the fact that I like both, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with the first. So, uh, when I first met my pilot, I was seized by the scars they carried with them.\nAnd the thing that that immediately makes me wonder is like… so I\u0026rsquo;ve been– I was built to kill the enemy\u0026rsquo;s ace. The scars of my pilot could imply like, this is somebody who has been defeated by the ace before? And, you know, carries reminders of it, which could showcase, like, a personal investment. It could also speak to just having a really long history in the war? And that could mean either, like, they\u0026rsquo;re being sent on this mission because they have a lot of experience, which means that they\u0026rsquo;re the best and the most likely to succeed; it could also mean that they\u0026rsquo;re done. They\u0026rsquo;re like, this is going to be really hard and it might be the last mission, um, but I don\u0026rsquo;t care because I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for too long. There are kind of a lot of ways forward with that.\nAlternately, like one– uh, one other possible avenue to explore is that they have some sort of very specific scarring that indicates… an unusual history? Like, the idea that I meet this pilot and notice that they have scars on their hands that indicate that they\u0026rsquo;re not a soldier or they haven\u0026rsquo;t generally been a soldier, that they are a mechanic, uh, or even, even like– it isn\u0026rsquo;t this, but when you see certain scars on people\u0026rsquo;s hands and arms and you just know that they have worked in a professional kitchen for a very long time? The idea of seeing very specific scars and knowing, uh, like, \u0026ldquo;oh. You\u0026rsquo;re being sent on this for a different reason. You\u0026rsquo;re not a– those aren\u0026rsquo;t- those aren\u0026rsquo;t battle scars. Those are– those are wounds from whatever your day job normally is,\u0026rdquo; which is, like, intriguing, right? \u0026lsquo;Cause then it\u0026rsquo;s like, why are you being sent on this mission?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s obviously very appealing to me considering how long I talked about it. So I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– gonna think on that as I go forward.\nDEE: I am again going to combine a few of these things.\n\u0026ldquo;The romance of their voice.\u0026rdquo; She has a very beautiful voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Their power to command the hearts of others.\u0026rdquo; She has a huge amount of presence. People sort of naturally defer to her. She\u0026rsquo;s probably, like, fairly highly ranked in our- our- our- our military, but like- but- but- but not, like, really high, right? So I feel like pilots in the real world and like the air force, pilots are always officers. They always have a degree of rank, but they\u0026rsquo;re not like colonels or generals because those people are leading large units.\nSo she\u0026rsquo;s like a lieutenant commander. Uh… gosh, there\u0026rsquo;s so much here. She\u0026rsquo;s a lieutenant commander, because we use naval ranks because I think that they\u0026rsquo;re sexier, and she– which is like, that\u0026rsquo;s, like, a high rank for a pilot. She sort of, like, maxed out on the pilot career track. And if she gets promoted again, she\u0026rsquo;ll be expected not to be actually piloting and to be in command of some sort of unit.\nBut, like, just everybody defers to her, right? Like the– I mean her, you know, her literal commanding officers don\u0026rsquo;t, but every other pilot, even the ones who have the same rank are like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, you\u0026rsquo;re in charge. I\u0026rsquo;ll follow your lead.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen she\u0026rsquo;s on the sort of like maintenance deck– um, because these are, you know, I talked about like, there\u0026rsquo;s this very physical, like, like shells are popping out and everything is like missiles. There\u0026rsquo;s no lasers. Every- everything is very physical. So you know, there needs to be this huge deck that we launched from where there are lots of mechanics running around and there\u0026rsquo;s like lifts and scaffolding and people welding things. Everything is, everything is very physical.\nEverybody on that deck is, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of like– like, she gets what she wants, because she gets the job done.\nAlso \u0026ldquo;her mastery of the technical.\u0026rdquo; Um, I think that while she has this sort of romance to her, she also… she\u0026rsquo;s very good at the details. And that\u0026rsquo;s the thing that people miss a lot of the time that- that I know. That\u0026rsquo;s sort of the side I see, that when she gets in the cockpit, she is all about, like, the fundamentals. About like targeting angles, smart tactics, uh, knowing the exact capabilities that I have and all- that all of our weapons have.\nSo yeah, I think that those were my first impression, right? I was like, \u0026ldquo;Wow, this woman is very impressive. She has a beautiful voice.\u0026rdquo; What kind of voice does she have? She has a– she has a low voice, still feminine, but the sort of like scratchy low thing.\nYeah. And I was very impressed by all that and maybe kind of crushing, but it was when she was piloting me and I realised how good she was at this and how thoughtful she was about this, is sort of when I fell in love.\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;The fire in their eyes.\u0026rdquo; [Contented sigh of agony] I love– I love this particular setup because I think, I think it gives you the most, like… fun room to play with– the idea of someone who has a real fury and fire in their- in their eyes. That we are on a mission to kill one particular person in the fight to control our world is… it gives an evocative vibe, while also still, I think, you know… I just like it.\nSATAH: I am going to want to define a name for myself and for the pilot, but other than that, I think it\u0026rsquo;s okay to just go right into the memories and kind of, like, define more from there, right? Um, figure out in the play in the- in the- in- in that area of play more, more details. Um, but I am going to come up with a name.\nDEE: So let\u0026rsquo;s sort of put this all together. I wonder if we\u0026rsquo;re in space or if we\u0026rsquo;re on the ground or both. Um, in Gundam, we would be both.\nOkay. We are on a big carrier that we launch out of that has, like, a whole squadron of other mechs. And I think there may be other mechs like me that are the same model who are relatively uncommon because we\u0026rsquo;re these sort of, like, heavy mechs that are for a very specific purpose.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to call us– what\u0026rsquo;s like a sexy… thing… um, I also want to have a feminine name… uh… what\u0026rsquo;s a good naming scheme? So you\u0026rsquo;ve got like… Gundam Wing, it\u0026rsquo;s the zodiac. It could be like…\nI\u0026rsquo;m actually going to look, uh, uh– I had a home game of beam saber a while ago and I did a ton of stuff… I like came up with a ton of naming conventions… but which of these files was it? Oh my god. I really went HAM on this.\nHere we go. Okay. Factions and squads, the document I made, I had all the different brands of people who manufacture. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got like deities… weapons, which is smart… soldiers, like right rifleman, hoplite, dragoon… virtues! That\u0026rsquo;s kind of fun, too. Yeah. Okay.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to go for a theme of the mechs on our side, at least, are named after weapons. [Mumbling while typing] Wiki melee weapons.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of types of sword.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to be an Adze [Said like \u0026ldquo;Ads\u0026rdquo;]. Uh, I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if that\u0026rsquo;s how you say it. An A D Z E. \u0026ldquo;An ancient and versatile cutting tool similar to an ax, but with a cutting edge perpendicular to the handle rather than parallel.\u0026rdquo;\nUm, and I think that I am a prototype. I\u0026rsquo;m like, the first one. So I have the, uh– I have the distinction of being the… gosh, I\u0026rsquo;m defaulting to Evangelion where it\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026ldquo;prototype\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;production.\u0026rdquo; Is there another way to say that?\nOkay. I\u0026rsquo;m the Adze-E. The E is for experimental. And then all of the other Adze would be called– [Trying out how to properly pluralise \u0026ldquo;adze\u0026rdquo;] Adze-es? Adze? Y\u0026rsquo;know– usually they\u0026rsquo;re just called [Still experimenting with pluralising] Adze– Adze– Adzes– but technically they would be the Adze-P, and then like a, you know, like a zero, zero, one, that kind of thing.\nUm, but I\u0026rsquo;m the Adze-E and I\u0026rsquo;m the only one, because I was the first one deployed and my pilot was the one who proved that the model was worth putting into production. Because she\u0026rsquo;s sooo great. Um… [Giggling]\nSATAH: Mech names, I\u0026rsquo;m very drawn to full phrases and then a short word– a short name taken out of it.\nOne of the words that came up when I looked at my little random generator was \u0026ldquo;obligation,\u0026rdquo; which is great. And I think that could be part of the nickname, but also the thing that it made me think of was just– I was thinking about short forms and I went \u0026ldquo;Blig\u0026rdquo;, which, no– but that is so close to the word Brig. I think that\u0026rsquo;s going to be the pilot\u0026rsquo;s name. It\u0026rsquo;s like, Brig– wow, the first thing that my brain supplied for me as a last name was \u0026ldquo;cadaver.\u0026rdquo; Brig Cadaver… rules is the problem. [Heavy pause] \u0026lsquo;K. Pilot\u0026rsquo;s name is Brig Cadaver. [Laughs]\nDEE: Of course… of course our opponents would probably have a different naming scheme because they probably make their own mechs.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s– I kind of like the idea, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of freaky– I really liked virtues before. I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s kind of freaky and like a \u0026ldquo;are we the baddies?\u0026rdquo; moment if we\u0026rsquo;re named– our mechs are named for weapons and theirs are named for virtues.\nSo theirs are like the… [Typing] the courage, the dauntless, the wisdom…\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to come back to the text for describe the war. \u0026ldquo;Go into as much detail as you like, give things names, come up with technobabble, or leave it for your memories.\u0026rdquo; Okay. So I can come up with stuff as we go. The– I have gone way into detail on what things are named. I still want to name the carrier that we\u0026rsquo;re on and I\u0026rsquo;m going to call that… let\u0026rsquo;s name those for cities. And so the carrier that we are on is on the Fiorenza. I think that\u0026rsquo;s how the Italians say Florence, right? \u0026ldquo;An obsolete name for Florence used during the middle ages.\u0026rdquo; [Experimenting with different levels of Italian in the pronunciation] Fiorenza, Fiorenza, not Fiorenza. Alright. Let\u0026rsquo;s follow our Italian friends.\nSo Fiorenza– sorry for my terrible pronunciation– is the name of the carrier, the ship that we\u0026rsquo;re on that flies us around.\nUm, but I do need to figure out my pilot. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at sci-fi name generators, see if this gives us anything good. Ooh, Artemis… or Tamsin. Those are both good names. I knew a Tamsin once. She was really cool. Let\u0026rsquo;s go with Tamsin. No relation to the Tamsin that I knew.\nAlright. So she\u0026rsquo;s Lieutenant Commander Tamsin… Dewitt is not bad. Foregrave… Callahan… something heroic. Calder? Tamsin Calder? Yeah, I like that. Lieutenant Commander Tamsin Calder. Oh my god… she\u0026rsquo;s so sexy.\nSATAH: And the mech name.\nSo I do like \u0026ldquo;obligation\u0026rdquo; being in there, but not necessarily the word that I use as a name. The first phrase that comes to mind with \u0026ldquo;obligation\u0026rdquo; is some sort of… is it an aphorism or something like that? Mechs being named after old wives tales kind of thing… is really fun to me. Um, and the reason I thought about that is that a phrase came to mind that was like, \u0026ldquo;The obligation of the something that somethings is to something.\u0026rdquo; Which has that sort of compact lesson that is really common in– what is- what\u0026rsquo;s- what\u0026rsquo;s the word I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of?\nProverb… I think is the word that I was thinking of. Just the really pat, uh, pithy saying that has a- a fundamental moral lesson that will obviously be very… over applied. I think that the idea that mechs in this world are generally named after whatever, like, internal proverbs they have is really appealing to me.\nAnd especially I think probably what that means is that you get people punning on proverbs that they don\u0026rsquo;t agree with? The– I- I looked up a list of proverbs and the very first one is \u0026ldquo;a bad workman always blames his tools.\u0026rdquo; And the idea of like– you\u0026rsquo;ve got a mech that is named A Bad Workman Always Blames His Tools, that you refer to as like Work or Bad Work or something like that. But if you disagree with that proverb, then developing a habit of saying that the mech\u0026rsquo;s name is, like, What Looks Like A Bad Workman Is Often Bad Tools, or something like that? Like it just– just having the culture of being like, \u0026ldquo;Ugh! I hate this proverb!\u0026rdquo;\nUh, yeah. So! A proverb with \u0026ldquo;obligation.\u0026rdquo; The direction my brain is going is, \u0026ldquo;The obligation of something with wings is…\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;to fly\u0026rdquo; but it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;to protect the sky\u0026rdquo; or something. But it could even be, like, \u0026ldquo;the obligation… of those with wings… is to eat the highest fruit?\u0026rdquo; Uh… and that\u0026rsquo;s supposed to both mean, like… if you\u0026rsquo;re really good at something or if you have some sort of skill, you have to use it. And also… you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be taking the easier way… because you should leave the easier way accessible for people who don\u0026rsquo;t have your skill? So it is implying a morality of, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re good at something, you HAVE to do it.\u0026rdquo; And also, \u0026ldquo;Some people aren\u0026rsquo;t good at things and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. But! As somebody who is good at that thing, it is your moral imperative to make sure that they are still able to get that need met.\u0026rdquo; [Big laugh]\nSo the mech name in full, uh, is… how was it that I put it? Uh… what I\u0026rsquo;ve written down is \u0026ldquo;The creature with the strongest wings has an obligation to the highest fruit.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s the full name… and what is it that they are referred to by? Wings is a possibility, probably too generic. Fruit would be funny. Highest Fruit? Th– [Laughs] I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to take it seriously. It sounds like I\u0026rsquo;m talking about my stoner gay friends. [Laughs] Uh…\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to amend it to \u0026ldquo;The creature with the strongest wings has an obligation to pick the highest fruit\u0026rdquo; and probably the mech is often referred to as Pick. Yeah. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that develops in the memories, but let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ve got our pilot, Brig Cadaver and their mech, The Creature With The Strongest Wings Has An Obligation To Pick The Highest Fruit… AKA Pick.\nWow. I need a game where you just come up with proverbs and then name mechs after them. Because that… was very fun to me. [Laughing]\nDEE: I\u0026rsquo;ve established that there are two sides and, like, each side uses different kinds of mechs. Um, there\u0026rsquo;s like a… we have, I guess, our own industrial bases.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s going on here? What are the cultural forces?\nThe Gundam palette that I keep coming back to is sort of that… it\u0026rsquo;s always about colonies versus Earth. That plays out a lot of different ways in Gundam. But I kind of… let\u0026rsquo;s do something different. Let\u0026rsquo;s not do that. I do like the idea of– let\u0026rsquo;s, like, keep it to the solar system. So it\u0026rsquo;s sort of, like, slow space travel. We\u0026rsquo;re not warping across the galaxy. We are very sort of, like, grounded.\n[Thoughtful humming] Stuff has to happen in very close distances… oh gosh, I see how we wind up with the Gundam equation if we go with Gundam aesthetics. Because if I\u0026rsquo;m firing bullets in space and missiles in space, things are happening at very short distances, because you know like, you need… other kinds of solutions. Like, across the kinds of distances that you can get in space, you can\u0026rsquo;t sort of like– you\u0026rsquo;re not dog fighting. It\u0026rsquo;s very strategic.\nBut so, um… but no, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. The balance of power is that we have to get into knife fighting range if we want to interact at all. And that probably means that we are like, yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s keep pretty close. Let\u0026rsquo;s keep pretty close to home. I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna… I\u0026rsquo;m gonna give up to the Gundam. I\u0026rsquo;m going to embrace the Gundam.\nAnd I think this conflict is between… the moon and Earth. The beautiful moon. The moon has been colonised and, like… probably was… was very, was kind of a capitalist hellscape, right? Because… all of the- all of the construction that was done there, it\u0026rsquo;s for– because it\u0026rsquo;s easier to build certain things in low gravity…\nThat can sort of be our unobtainium, right? Like, whatever. There\u0026rsquo;s some compound that allows us to do all of these launches. Like, we still have to, like, launch from Earth, like a rocket has to go up, but, uh you know, we have sort of like… no, actually! Actually, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s why there\u0026rsquo;s so much stuff on the moon, because it\u0026rsquo;s still expensive to launch things from Earth. Like, so… we went and we– you know, these big corporations enabled by lax national governments, build all of the stuff on the moon, uh, because then you could have space industry for a much lower cost. Because you\u0026rsquo;re not always shooting these big rockets into space.\nAnd I think that the moon is the bad guys. Um, it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s innately tempting to me to make them the good guys. But the– the moon is really kind of this corporate dystopia, where it was like founded by corporations, developed by corporations… and you know, of course, there are real people on the moon with real problems, real human concerns, but they are ruled by corporations who have no accountability, no oversight.\nAnd what has started to happen is that the mega corporations are so powerful that they, uh– they were kind of ruling Earth, and… I think that this war was framed at first as a war of independence,? Or not– not just independence, but sort of like casting off the yoke of these like evil corporations on the moon. That\u0026rsquo;s how it was played, you know, on our side, on the Earth side.\nBut what has become increasingly clear is that it\u0026rsquo;s actually just power fighting power. Right? Because there are… all of the exact same forces are at work on Earth. They are just, you know, like– they\u0026rsquo;re just framed differently. Like– corporations came up with this brand new power base on the moon, where they had no accountability, and they can really just go HAM, and that never happened on Earth– the corporations that are sort of building the things for our side are still leashed– but it\u0026rsquo;s also the military industrial complex, right? It\u0026rsquo;s these like ostensibly republican governments that actually– like, people feel hugely alienated from, that have these sort of like very calcified political classes and are deeply involved and tangled with these huge corporations that are producing the mechs that we use to fight the moon.\nAnd I think that there\u0026rsquo;s probably something like the– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna write this down– there\u0026rsquo;s probably something like the… I think the words are going to be \u0026ldquo;coalition\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;alliance\u0026rdquo; and the more heroic one should go to Earth. Because we my pilot has like, at least at some point, thought of- of us as the good guys.\nSo I think it\u0026rsquo;s just going to be the Earth Alliance and the Lunar Coalition. Or the Coalition of Luna. That\u0026rsquo;s better. And we\u0026rsquo;ve been fighting for, like, twenty years now. Society is structured around this war. You know, like people are– like the military is huge, there\u0026rsquo;s conscription, like, industry is being repurposed has been repurposed to build the tools of war, and the rich are getting richer and richer and richer.\nI think that, like, probably the– there\u0026rsquo;s parts of Earth that are controlled by the Coalition of Luna, because like they need… I assume they need like air and water and stuff, um, and food is probably harder to grow on the moon. So they\u0026rsquo;re sort of like… a lot of our fighting is done over territory on Earth. Sometime it– sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s territory in space.\nYeah, I think we have enough. And a lot will come up in the memories, too. So let\u0026rsquo;s… gooooo.\nBREAK SATAH: Okay, look, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to sugarcoat it. I am… so thrilled that this game about cybernetic longing and tragedy is being played by a full trio of Canadian dykes. The country is a coincidence and, uh, confers no particular benefits narratively, but I do think the lesbianism is both relevant and vital.\nBrianna Price is a TTRPG designer and accessibility coordinator. I have had the enormous pleasure of playtesting a lot of her work, so I\u0026rsquo;m very familiar with it. You can find some of it at weepingrobot.itch.io. And I particularly want to shine a light on the alpha slash playtesting edition that\u0026rsquo;s currently available of Brothers in Arms, which is a, uh, Forged in the Dark ish game about– fittingly for this series– being a construct created for war. The campaign of Brothers in Arms that I played is probably one of my most cherished TTRPG experiences, so I really, really highly recommend you give it a look. Brianna also streams regularly at twitch.tv/saltcravings, particularly the Worst Foot Forward series, where she and her cohost play the worst games in a given game series. And you can follow her on Bluesky at priceofbrie.\nDora quotation marks \u0026ldquo;Dee\u0026rdquo; Rogers is a writer and game designer whose solo work can be found at deecity.itch.io and whose work with her wife can be found at gal-pal-games.itch.io. Tomorrow she is launching a crowdfunder for Drink My Sweat, a TTRPG about queer feminine transgression and messy attraction expressed through the ritualised violence of a fight club. As someone who loves to put characters in situations, I am so incredibly compelled by the basic pitch that you don\u0026rsquo;t win by winning, you win by getting the most messed up. If you\u0026rsquo;re listening to this episode the day that it drops, you can follow the Kickstarter to be notified when it launches tomorrow. If you\u0026rsquo;re listening anytime in February, go and back it immediately.\nAs for me, I\u0026rsquo;m Satah and you are currently listening to my show. Thank you. I\u0026rsquo;m a game designer, editor, and musician. You can find a bunch of my work at gaygothvibes.online. I released an EP at the end of last year called it\u0026rsquo;s really only, which you can find at peopleyoumeetoutsideofbars.bandcamp.com as well as on your preferred music rental service. Which people who are less annoying than me call streaming services.\nAs we get into the memories, I want to mention the game\u0026rsquo;s beautiful instruction to mark your chassis. It asks you to physically write on your own body every time you narrate a memory, which creates this deeply visceral reminder of what you and your character have gone through. Both Brianna and Dee do this, and I… don\u0026rsquo;t! In my playthrough. Internally, completely unconsciously, I had sorted it into something that is not relevant to an audio medium. I really regret that that went unexamined long enough for me to miss it because I think that it is deeply meaningful to the emotional arc of the game, so I really encourage you to pay attention to that if you play.\nNow it is time to remember.\nGAME: MEMORY ONE BRIANNA: Section two is that we relive our memories.\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;Now we take it in turns reliving the memories of your love for your pilot. These are the memories that rush through your AI core…\nBRIANNA \u0026amp; DEE: \u0026ldquo;as you stand on the field of battle…\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;forced to make a choice about both your futures.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: We\u0026rsquo;re going to do seven scenes. I think. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve waffled between five and seven, but I think that seven will work. Seven is the suggested amount for one player, but I just worry about… it being too long and asking guests to record things for seventeen… hundred hours or whatever…\nBRIANNA: We\u0026rsquo;re going to do seven scenes. We\u0026rsquo;re going to do seven scenes. I wanna marinate in this.\n\u0026ldquo;The person who most recently confessed their love for someone goes first.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: I really love this prompt though. Like, I love tools for how you decide who goes first. I think every game should have one. It\u0026rsquo;s arbitrary, but it just, like, stops there from being a moment where everybody pauses at the table and isn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to do.\nUm, \u0026ldquo;confessed\u0026rdquo; is an interesting word. I\u0026rsquo;m married, so I confessed my love to her a long time ago, but I tell her I love her all the time. Is that the same thing?\nBRIEF INTERRUPTION SATAH: Not weighing in on Dee\u0026rsquo;s question, but I just feel the perhaps lightly neurotic need to clarify that the order of memories in the show? Is mandated by a different– but I think you\u0026rsquo;ll agree, equally evocative– reason of my completely subjective yet… deeply correct… opinions on flow. Uh. Hope– hope this helps. Hope this helps.\nGAME: MEMORY ONE (CONT\u0026rsquo;D) BRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;Pick a prompt from the list. Now describe a scene aloud based on the prompt.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;Once you\u0026rsquo;re done, mark your chassis as a reminder. A tally mark on your hand will do.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: And I think… I think just hop right into it. Just have to read one thing aloud.\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;Read the following aloud.\u0026rdquo;\nALL, OVERLAPPING/REPEATING EACH OTHER: \u0026ldquo;Focus on your love. Tell us what you remember.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: This is a list of thirty prompts. And again, I love to roll dice, so I am going to roll on this. Obviously thirty is not a die that actually exists and I could do it digitally, but what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is just… subdivide it into three different lists of ten items. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a D4– uh, discard the four– to choose like, am I choosing from the first ten items? The second ten items, or the third ten items… and then I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a D10 to figure out which one… I do!\n[Laughing] One of those ideas that\u0026rsquo;s much more complicated to explain than to do.\nDEE: I\u0026rsquo;m going to- I am going to use a random number generator, but then I\u0026rsquo;m going to reserve the right to override it or to zoom in on something if I want.\nRandom.org… love you, Random.\nOne random integer between one and thirty, inclusive. Great.\nBRIANNA: I just– I guess I just choose? I might– I kind of want to just roll for this, a little bit. So maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll see if I can roll D… just to get me started. I\u0026rsquo;ll see if I can roll a D30. Shout out to those sites. Okay. Sixteen.\n\u0026ldquo;How they spoke of you when they thought you weren\u0026rsquo;t listening.\u0026rdquo;\nI remember, I think… the first time that I interacted with them, they didn\u0026rsquo;t know that we were interacting. They thought I was still deactivated. They were talking to some… to a general. A general that I am– I vaguely knew, was just someone important. Um, and they were complaining. They were like, you know. They were saying…\nBRIANNA, AS THE PILOT: It\u0026rsquo;s so small. How am I supposed to pilot in something like that? I mean..! I\u0026rsquo;ll have no freedom of movement. [Scoffing] Like… what\u0026rsquo;s the point of piloting something when it\u0026rsquo;s barely that much bigger than me? Out there, they\u0026rsquo;re fighting in behemoths and you\u0026rsquo;ve given me a– what is that? Nine feet, ten feet tall? That\u0026rsquo;s nothing!\nBRIANNA: And they kind of came over and looked at me. Sort of studied me, said,\nBRIANNA, AS THE PILOT: I\u0026rsquo;m not a stealth pilot. I\u0026rsquo;m a warrior. I\u0026rsquo;m not a coward and I won\u0026rsquo;t pilot a cowardly mech.\nBRIANNA: At the time, I think I was so new, I didn\u0026rsquo;t… fully understand. But. When they shoved themself into my cockpit, like a child having a tantrum, I understood that they didn\u0026rsquo;t want me.\n[Sound of a marker lid popping] Tally mark one…\nSATAH: [Die clatter] So I rolled a two, so this is going to be one of the results from eleven to twenty. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a D10 to see which one. [Die clatter] And I got a seven.\nSeventeen: \u0026ldquo;When you asked them to do something for you.\u0026rdquo; Huh…\nSo… I think. I am going to go with the pilot being a mechanic? Or… even kind of a factory worker? And- and the scars that I noticed, they\u0026rsquo;re just very telltale signs of like, oh, you work at a machine that– like, you\u0026rsquo;re assembling a similar thing repeatedly a lot during a day. And there are very telltale just- burns from equipment and that kind of thing on- on- on her arms. And…\nAnd so I think what it is– leaning also on the thing of like me being designed specifically for the enemy ace and maybe not having certain functions– what I want this to be is an early moment of… showing some vulnerability? Like, like Pick showing some vulnerability to Brig. And I want, I want to find… a function that has not been… that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t designed to have, that I can ask Brig to give me.\nSo. I think… the area that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of going- the direction I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of going is that… I have vision cores, right? Like sensors. I can– I can some form of, like, see things around me. But because I was built with such specific things in mind, they were like, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re only going to give you the very essential vision cores that you would need for fighting and for tracking.\u0026rdquo; And so the vision cores that I have are like, I can see movement, I can see heat, and probably read some other sort of energy signature type things, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything programmed into me, or I don\u0026rsquo;t have any hardware, that would allow me to just see in a similar way to a human or even a lot of animals kind of thing.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s like… Brig and I were doing some sort of training exercise… probably like a– a– it\u0026rsquo;s a training exercise that is also sort of, like, uh, compatibility programming. Like this is just standard with pilots who need to have, like, a particularly strong connection with their mech, which usually they do. Is there\u0026rsquo;s like training courses that you do that not only like help the pilot learn, like, how do I maneuver in this, blah, blah, blah, whatever, but help… something in the mech\u0026rsquo;s programming, like, get used to the pilot and what the pilot might need and that kind of thing.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing these training courses. And it\u0026rsquo;s on… like a moon near the planet that we live on– that we were built on– I haven\u0026rsquo;t really defined sort of what this– what the scale of this is or where we are, but that much at least I\u0026rsquo;m going to say… generally live on this planet and probably connected space stations and that kind of thing. And this whole moon has been turned into… huge– into a training facility for mechs. Like it is just the entire planet– quote unquote, not a planet, moon, whatever– is full scale mech training grounds.\nAnd so… we\u0026rsquo;re up there. And usually you\u0026rsquo;re going through those with other people, uh, going through them with like the rest of your squad or just kind of coincidentally, a lot of people are all being trained at the same time, because a new round of mechs has come out, or there\u0026rsquo;s a big battle or a new round of pilots has come up through the academy or whatever. But this is just Brig and Pick, because… we have a very unique job to do? And also, uh, trying to keep it subtle, hoping that, like, enemy forces kind of won\u0026rsquo;t notice that training is happening if we just have us.\nSo. We have gone through– we\u0026rsquo;ve had this full long day of going through all these courses and it\u0026rsquo;s been going really well. I think that I\u0026rsquo;ll just– I\u0026rsquo;ll- I\u0026rsquo;ll say that it seems to go well kind of from the beginning? There wasn\u0026rsquo;t a huge amount of getting to know each other. And I think in part this is like… Brig doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of stuff to… counter program, I guess is what I\u0026rsquo;ll say? Like– one of the reasons that- that- that- that- that she has been put on this specific assignment is because I\u0026rsquo;m kind of a weird mech. And the theory in command was that it might actually be more difficult to train a seasoned pilot how to interact with me than it might be to take somebody who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any of that training, who is just a blank canvas, and train them to fly with me.\nSo… it\u0026rsquo;s been going well! And these have been really long days and we are just… sitting. You know? And watching the sun go behind our planet, like a very weird sunset.\nAnd Brig is like, \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t that beautiful? It\u0026rsquo;s like this whole different perspective on this sun that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen rise and fall every day…\u0026rdquo; or every two days or whatever the– whatever our weird space calendar is here. \u0026ldquo;And it\u0026rsquo;s this whole new perspective. It makes me- makes me appreciate it all over again. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it gorgeous?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I just sort of stay silent and then say, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so glad that you appreciate it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think she\u0026rsquo;s kind of teasing. She\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Come on, isn\u0026rsquo;t it pretty? I know that you could appreciate this stuff. Come on.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I pause again and I tell her, like, I can\u0026rsquo;t see it. Like– that– I don\u0026rsquo;t have those type of visual sensors. They weren\u0026rsquo;t considered necessary for the mission. And so I can\u0026rsquo;t see it. But I believe you! And I\u0026rsquo;m so glad.\nAnd she gets quiet in a way that… I find worrying? And I think… I don\u0026rsquo;t know her well enough yet to know– because I think that she- she feels she\u0026rsquo;s upset about this because she\u0026rsquo;s like, that sucks. They should– they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, like- take that away from you. Like that\u0026rsquo;s a standard issue thing. They should not give you that just because you have a specific job. But I think I\u0026rsquo;m like, oh, is she worried that I will be less effective or whatever?\nAnd I want to make sure I want to make really sure that the direction I\u0026rsquo;m going here– because it would be really easy for Brig to offer and me to accept. But I do… because the prompt was \u0026ldquo;when you ask them to do something for you,\u0026rdquo; I do want to make sure that there is still that level of active, uh… agency for me, that I am asking for something?\nAnd so I think what it– what it does is… Brig goes silent. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to upset you. There are multiple standard features that I do not come equipped with. I would be more than happy to provide you with a list if you would like to review it and bring it up to command.\u0026rdquo; You know, that, \u0026ldquo;We want to make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re perfectly comfortable,\u0026rdquo; and blah, blah, blah, and I\u0026rsquo;m doing a whole thing.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, thanks, Pick. I guess I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t assume– would you like to be able to see it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Well, it sounds beautiful the way that you\u0026rsquo;re describing it. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that I would.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she says, \u0026ldquo;Well, how about we just ask Command to give you those sensors? Like, they\u0026rsquo;re standard issue. That shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I… I guess I immediately have a slightly different perspective on what might be possible in Command? And I think I take the risk… I pause and- and think about it. And I make a pretty risky request, which is basically to say, like, \u0026ldquo;Command has issued me with everything that they can consider necessary and will not be making further revisions unless specifically requested by you for tactical reasons.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s a pause again in which Brig is like, clearly trying to mull over like, okay, how can I make this tactical? Because I\u0026rsquo;ve probably provided the briefs of like, \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s why we don\u0026rsquo;t need to include this,\u0026rdquo; right? Like, whatever justification the designers did, I\u0026rsquo;ve like given her, here\u0026rsquo;s their arguments, you\u0026rsquo;re probably not going to win this. And she\u0026rsquo;s trying to think through, how can I win this anyway?\nAnd finally, I say, \u0026ldquo;It is possible for a skilled mechanic to make these alterations of their own volition and does not, technically– as long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with official functions– is not technically worth a reprimand.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s not, in that moment, an explicit ask. I don\u0026rsquo;t ask, like, \u0026ldquo;Will you do this for me?\u0026rdquo; Like I don\u0026rsquo;t form the question. But it is very obvious that I am saying, \u0026ldquo;Hey, you could just install it if you get one. And I\u0026rsquo;m asking you to.\u0026rdquo; You know? Like I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t, if I didn\u0026rsquo;t want you to, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have said that. I would just continue to shut down the possibility.\nAnd she, like, smiles, and… part of the angle of solidarity here, I think… that I thought I would end up exploring more and I didn\u0026rsquo;t, but I just want to make explicit anyway, is like: she is also a tool that is being used for a different purpose? And that has made a– a choice that goes against a lot of what her… design… the design of her life would be. She\u0026rsquo;s a mechanic, she\u0026rsquo;s a factory worker, whatever that exact thing is, but she is being given the opportunity to be a pilot. And so she wants to do that for me. She sees the thing, the way that I have been designed, the way that my life is supposed to be, and she wants to open that up for me. And so she does.\nShe finds the hardware and installs it and allows me to have a type of vision where I can like see colours and see images in a way that\u0026rsquo;s much closer to the way that her vision, her human vision, her– her particular human vision operates. And installs it and it\u0026rsquo;s great and it\u0026rsquo;s nice. [Giggles] And we get to watch one of those sunsets together. She manages to locate it like right before training ends, you know? And it\u0026rsquo;s the very last sunset on this moon, that we actually do get to watch together.\nOne note is that she can install the hardware, but, and she says to me like, \u0026ldquo;If I have to do any custom software, we\u0026rsquo;re fucked. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m… I\u0026rsquo;m not a programmer, I\u0026rsquo;m not a hacker.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, I think… you know. Pop- pop the disk in, I can probably figure it out.\nDEE: Four. \u0026ldquo;The night you spent watching comets and talking about the future.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s beautiful. Um… okay, \u0026ldquo;Focus on your love. Tell us what you remember.\u0026rdquo;\nI think that I was first deployed in space. Tamsin, of course, is from Earth and… she had piloted lots of mechs before me. And I think she– this is interesting. I think that AI mechs are an innovation during this war. And I was the first AI mech that she had piloted. So she loved her other mechs as, um, people who work very closely with machines love the machines that they work with. And she loved me that way. I think that, um… she was… she was very impressed with me from the first time that we went out, um with my– with my body is what we\u0026rsquo;ll call it, right? With my- my- my physical capabilities, my armor, my weaponry, um, my precision targeting, and also the way- the way that I pilot.\nLike I\u0026rsquo;m probably really hard to pilot [Laughing], which is why we needed somebody as good as Tamsin. You know, it\u0026rsquo;s like driving a sixteen-wheeler, sort of. It\u0026rsquo;s like, you have to be strong, you have to be decisive, you have to sort of see three moves ahead in order to keep up with the action in a battle. And she\u0026rsquo;s all those things.\nYeah, so she was really impressed with me as a mech, as somebody who\u0026rsquo;s an expert in mechs. But I\u0026rsquo;m also an AI. And I think that, uh… gosh, this is so interesting– sorry, I have this whole thing…\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about recently that, because we live in the age of large language models… and I think that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of ways in which AIs have been a symbol of marginalisation, marginalised people, either like marginalised genders or racialised people, going back to… like… I mean, heck, going back to Frankenstein, frankly, but also like Rossum\u0026rsquo;s Universal Robots. But, like, the way that they\u0026rsquo;re actually working in practice is kind of the opposite of that? Like, they\u0026rsquo;re faulty consumer products. Which is like, you know, they\u0026rsquo;re products that are way overhyped that actually do a lot of harm. Um, so marginalisation is not a good metaphor to think of as a way to think about… as a way to think about ChatGPT or Gemini or whatever.\nI think where that leads me is I think that Tamsin hated the fact that there was an AI in this machine that she really liked. At first. I think that my- my- my function in combat is… like, I can pilot– I can pilot myself, like I have an autopilot function, um but that\u0026rsquo;s really only good for moving from place to place. Y\u0026rsquo;know, like, I can be like, okay, now I\u0026rsquo;m going to fly through space on a certain orbit for, like, four hours to get us to where we need to be. Or, like, I will trudge across this landscape so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be guiding us in a precision way all this time. Um, and I also, like, can assist with a lot of things. And I think that Tamsin and I have probably worked out that I do a lot less of this than I\u0026rsquo;m capable of. Like… y\u0026rsquo;know, there\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be sort of like… I enable a much simpler way of interacting with the mech than pilots were used to. Um, like, you have to do a lot less controlling the limbs, you know, like, manually. But Tamsin prefers to do that, and it\u0026rsquo;s part of what makes her so incredible as a pilot. So we have worked out between us, as our partnership developed, that she does most of it.\nUm, gosh, I am talking a lot about– and I haven\u0026rsquo;t even mentioned the comets. But my point is that Tamsin, at first, just hated me because she thought of me as another consumerist creation that wassort of being forced on her by… not superiors, because it\u0026rsquo;s not like she doesn\u0026rsquo;t trust her commanding officer necessarily, but by, like, large forces that she had grew to distrust. Right? I think that by the time I came along, she was already kind of like, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no incentive for this war to end. Like, they actually want this war to continue. And I know that if don\u0026rsquo;t… like, if we lose, there are real consequences. There will be civilians who suffer, not to mention my comrades will suffer and might die. But it\u0026rsquo;s not as though things are going to get better if I keep winning.\u0026rdquo; So she already had this deep disdain for stuff that came down.\nBut she admired this machine. She desired– like, admired the doctrine. She was like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s cool that this is purpose-built for this specific situation that we run into where people get mowed down by this really heavy firepower. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad it has this AI. I\u0026rsquo;m going to use it as little as possible.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd… I think that… and this is something that the corporations probably actually hate. [Chuckles] I think that maybe they stopped creating– they stopped using AIs in mechs at a certain point, or true AIs. Because the theory was, at the time, that mechs were so complex that they actually needed to have a general intelligence, which is what I am. They actually needed a general intelligence to assist the pilot. Um, so I\u0026rsquo;m like a science fiction AI. I\u0026rsquo;m a person. I\u0026rsquo;m a person. And at a certain point, they stopped putting people in mechs. Because people are just inconvenient. We, uh… we have opinions. We form relationships. People start to ask, like, \u0026ldquo;Wait, don\u0026rsquo;t these things have rights if they\u0026rsquo;re people?\u0026rdquo; Um, so I think that actually they\u0026rsquo;ve stopped making them and they\u0026rsquo;re sort of trying to… they want to obsolete us. Right? Like, they have an incentive for the Adze class no longer to be used, because all of the Adzes that were made before a certain date have people in them. Are people.\n[Sigh] And it took Tamsin a while to accept that. To accept that I was a person. And this was before people were getting phased out, before generalized AIs were getting phased out of mechs. And the night that she accepted was the night that we spent watching comets and talking about the future.\nAnd yeah, I think it was my first time on earth. We were back from a mission. We were at sort of a forward operating base and she… had heard… she has a loved one. She has a sister who told her this, who like, had reminded her that there was going to be a, um… y\u0026rsquo;know, a comet visible from Earth. And I think that her correspondence is probably very censored, so she like– her sister didn\u0026rsquo;t know where Tamsin was going to be, but was like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, if you\u0026rsquo;re anywhere in this part of the world, you should check it out!\u0026rdquo; And she was. So it was a way of sort of feeling close to her sister, and also because comets are cool.\nShe, you know, we\u0026rsquo;re at this base, she was up late, um, like, in the cockpit doing some… uh, you know, checking systems, doing some maintenance. And, um. She opened up the cockpit and was just staring out at the comet. This sort of big bright spot in the night sky. And thinking about her sister.\nAnd I asked if I could see. And she was kind of amused by this and she sort of like switched on the main camera so that I could see, so that I could see the comet. And I think that sparked curiosity in her. And she was like, \u0026ldquo;Why do you want to see it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I just said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen one before.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that, you know, that was like… a moment where she was kind of like… this is a person, actually. This, like, little voice I\u0026rsquo;ve been arguing with and trying to turn on and, like, cursing out who\u0026rsquo;s weirdly nice to me despite all of that, is actually kind of a person. And she kind of got curious and asked me questions. And I asked her questions, like personal questions.\nAnd I think I asked her, I was really interested in her human life, her life outside of the war, especially when she told me about her sister and the comet. So I asked her questions about the past and that led to the conversation about the future where I said, \u0026ldquo;What do you want to do after the war?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think that she didn\u0026rsquo;t really know. I think that she\u0026rsquo;d HAD a dream. She wanted to be a… she wanted to be a pilot. Not a mech pilot, originally; she wanted to be like a… like a- like a spaceship pilot. You know, she pictured herself doing cargo runs up to the moon or just sort of, like, the small colonies that are out on the asteroid belt, and sort of being an adventurer and a traveler. And she was so good at it. She was such– she showed such aptitude as a pilot that they moved her into the mech pilot program when the war started or, you know, at some point in her training. Maybe the war was still going on when she came of age.\nUm, and… she kind of mused about the idea of doing that again. And I think I asked her what I could do after the war. And this was another moment where she was like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, you think about that?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I was like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I think about that. I think…\u0026rdquo; like, what would I have said? I think I said something like very charming, like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve wondered– I\u0026rsquo;ve wondered if Adzes could be used for agricultural work. I think I might like being outdoors.\u0026rdquo; You know, something kind of– like a little silly, but you know, like what else is a– like. I think she probably laughed at me and I was kind of like, yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of silly.\nAnd this again is a moment where she was kind of like, oh, this is actually– this is actually a person inside of this machine.\nThis is something I think about… I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking– obviously, as we all have, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about AI recently. Um, so I really like the movie Blade Runner 2049. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a very smart sequel. Uh– Blade Runner– okay, I won\u0026rsquo;t go on a tangent about Blade Runner. This recording is long enough. But there was a thing in Blade Runner 2049 where the– our hero has a girlfriend, basically, who is an AI. And I kept waiting for that to actually be a really bad idea? For her to be like, \u0026ldquo;I actually really love you, but like my factory settings are coming up and I have to betray you to the- to the corporation now.\u0026rdquo; And that never happened, which made me go like. It\u0026rsquo;s fucking crazy that this company sells people. Like, who actually have agency, when they could choose to not do that, presumably. Right? Like people are going to fight back if you– if you take away their independence. So why would you… want a person, right? Like surely you\u0026rsquo;d want… something that can only pretend to be a person.\nAnd I think that like– I think that in the wake of this comet, this night comet conversation, Tamsin was probably… maybe it was kind of like… \u0026ldquo;I think that they really fucked up and this is actually a person in this machine. That\u0026rsquo;s interesting! What kind of trouble can I get into with this person?\u0026rdquo;\nUm, yeah. Okay. \u0026ldquo;Once you are done, mark your chassis as a reminder. A tally mark on your hand will do,\u0026rdquo; but that\u0026rsquo;s not what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do. I am drawing… I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a comet on my wrist. Very badly because I\u0026rsquo;m a very bad artist. Yeah, that looks… really stupid. But. Picture that I have just, um, with eyeliner, drawn a little comet with its tail on the inside of my wrist on my right hand.\nAnd um… there\u0026rsquo;s a decal. Not a decal, that\u0026rsquo;s what it would be on like a- a- like a model Gundome. Tamsin stenciled a comet on my chassis after we had that- that night, as sort of a pledge to me.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

Love. Die. Remember. a game about \u0026ldquo;mechs falling in love with their pilots, reliving their memories of love before the end, and the cost of victory\u0026rdquo; by Ray Cox.\nWith me again are Brianna Price and Dora Rogers. Check out their links in the episode description, particularly Dee\u0026rsquo;s ongoing at the moment Kickstarter for Drink My Sweat, a Bottoms-inspired storytelling game for queer women. \u0026ldquo;Punch cuties, get messed up, fall in love, be fucking hot\u0026rdquo; funding now and throughout Zine Month, February 2025.\nLast week we established the parameters of the war and saw the first things our mechs remembered about their relationships to their pilots as they sit in the stretched out, frozen moment before the decisive action in their final battle. We join them, still in that moment, for more reminiscing.\nGAME: MEMORY TWO BRIANNA: Let\u0026rsquo;s roll again. You know what? It\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nDEE: Give me another random number.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s roll for the second memory, and then let\u0026rsquo;s make some lunch. Everyone all together, no matter when you\u0026rsquo;re hearing this, make some lunch.\nOkay, I rolled a 3 on my D4, so this is gonna be the results from 21 to 30. Rolling my D10. I got a 6, so it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be 26. \u0026ldquo;What you teased them about.\u0026rdquo; Interesting.\nSo the first thing I thought of was just they\u0026rsquo;re like– that she has a kind of adorable outsized reaction to space travel? That– I mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many pilots I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with, but I imagine that there is some baseline expectation of how pilots should act that I am aware of or have programmed into me or something. And the fact that she is so like, not nonchalant about space in the way that most pilots would be, I think is quite endearing.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that\u0026rsquo;s what I poke at. I think that what I might tease her about is… it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s her, like, mechanical special interest, right? Like– we\u0026rsquo;re doing surveillance. We\u0026rsquo;re watching the enemy ace train a bunch of rookies from a distance and she is getting very caught up in looking at the new hardware of the rookies being like, \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, look at these manufacturing… things… that they\u0026rsquo;ve evolved. Look at the ways that they\u0026rsquo;ve gotten better. Look at the ways they\u0026rsquo;ve put this together,\u0026rdquo; that kind of thing.\nAnd I think again, in a slightly dangerous way, I sort of tease her… about… sedition. Like– tease her about having seditious thoughts, admiring the artillery of the enemy, and suggesting in some way that their forces may be impressive in a way that ours are not.\nAnd… this is genuinely alarming to her at first because it sounds a little bit like the type of thing that maybe I am genuinely programmed to watch out for. Like, it would make sense if there was some sort of watchdog program inside of me that is- that is trained to, like, check if a pilot is maybe gonna… do… a treason! Because we\u0026rsquo;re giving them a lot of power and a lot of agency in their giant killing machines. And so, you know, we just want to keep an eye on that. We just want to make sure that they\u0026rsquo;re loyal!\nAnd so she\u0026rsquo;s genuinely nervous, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I crossed the line and I\u0026rsquo;m about to be reported and get reprimanded.\u0026rdquo; And then I push it a little farther, you know? Like she clams up and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Well, no, of course I think that this and this and this.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I just push it a little further where I turn it into more obvious of a joke, saying, like… playing into the like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re looking at other girls?\u0026rdquo; type thing. Like not literally that, but that\u0026rsquo;s very much the tone. And she slowly realizes that I\u0026rsquo;m joking and relaxes and laughs super hard and gets much more open and enthusiastic about sharing her interest with me? And her enthusiasm. Like, is- is very much like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m– I can just talk about this now. Great.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think quietly there is some part of me that\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, this is also just very tactically advantageous. Like, you\u0026rsquo;re excited and it does mean that you are… providing me with data that I can turn into something useful that might save our lives at some point.\u0026rdquo; Or– I think there\u0026rsquo;s even part of me that is like preemptively defensive. Like… if someone else catches word that she talks like this, they might genuinely think that she\u0026rsquo;s a problem. And so I am already analyzing the data and turning it into a report of like, \u0026ldquo;Actually, I think that you\u0026rsquo;ll find that Pilot Cadaver was able to notice all of these things. And now we know better how to defeat this particular type of enemy, blah, blah, blah.\u0026rdquo;\nBut yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s– I– I do some light teasing about their interest in mechanics being seditious thought.\nDEE: 28. [Wondrous gasp] \u0026ldquo;Your first dance.\u0026rdquo; Oh, wow. Oh, this is interesting.\nYour first dance. \u0026lsquo;Cause that could mean a few different things for a mech, right? Like, this could just mean us piloting. Like, her piloting me. Or it could mean an actual dance in some way.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s this really cute thing in Gundam: The Witch From Mercury, where they\u0026rsquo;re trying to like– the characters are trying to sort of, uh– they have the challenge of making this kind of scary mech technology kind of palatable to people? So they shoot this really silly video of the main character, Suletta dancing and her mech doing the same dance next to her, which is just what I immediately thought of when I saw this prompt. But, um– it\u0026rsquo;s not that, but maybe it has a little of that goofy energy.\nSo I think this started with Tamsin, uh… yeah, okay, okay. So back on- back on our ship, back on the the Firenze, there\u0026rsquo;s, uh… like, they\u0026rsquo;re on R\u0026amp;R, right? Like they\u0026rsquo;ve been on the front lines for a long time, and they\u0026rsquo;re getting their break, where they\u0026rsquo;re docked at a- at a big space station, the ship\u0026rsquo;s being repaired, but there\u0026rsquo;s not really anything to do on the space station. It\u0026rsquo;s just like a, y\u0026rsquo;know, glorified supply depot. So everybody\u0026rsquo;s going a little stir crazy, because we\u0026rsquo;re just sitting on the ship with, like, diminished duty.\nSo, um, the commanding officers– and like, I think Tamsin was sort of, like, involved in this as a senior officer– they decide to throw a dance. And they do it in the the mech bay, this like huge open space where all of these giant robots are gathered so that they can work on– be worked on. And I guess maybe the way that the space works is that there\u0026rsquo;s kind of, like, scaffolding along the sides and the mechs are all parked next to the scaffolding so that you can like– you know, you can you can work on the– like, the pilots can climb in, people can work on the upper parts of the mech. Yeah. And there\u0026rsquo;s a dance.\nAnd I think at this point– this was later, this is a good deal after the comet night. And this was, like– not, like, a recommended use case necessarily? Um, Tamsin had started leaving me on all the time, right? Like, I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to, like– you shut the mech off at– when you\u0026rsquo;re done with it. And the AI is basically asleep. And I think, you know, sometimes I do that because I can get bored. But, um, often, she would just leave me on because she started to think of me as a person. As a friend. So I\u0026rsquo;m on all the time now.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m just watching the dance. And it looks fucking fun.\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s probably a lot of different stuff that goes on at this dance, right? Like, there\u0026rsquo;s probably actually like line dancing, because, you know, they want it to be sort of, like, a lighthearted team building thing. So there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of that, which is, you know, I mean, line dancing can be a fucking blast. Um, it\u0026rsquo;s not like line dancing is tame. But later in the night, like, the music gets louder and more current, and the dancing gets kind of more chaotic.\nAnd I feel like given that we\u0026rsquo;re in kind of a forever war, there\u0026rsquo;s like a degree to which relationships inside of the service are, like, you know, they\u0026rsquo;re frowned upon, and obviously, like, you can\u0026rsquo;t do it within a chain of command. So it\u0026rsquo;s like the… like, you can\u0026rsquo;t sleep with your superior officer. And it means like the captain is ultimately out of luck. But it\u0026rsquo;s kind of tolerated for everybody else, right? Especially for more casual hookups. And there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of, like– a lot of couples are going to leave this dance. Couples or larger groups are going to leave this dance and have fun in other ways in different places. So the energy is very sexually charged.\nAnd Tamsin– Tamsin\u0026rsquo;s right out there. I think that Tamsin doesn\u0026rsquo;t– you know, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t- she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a partner. There\u0026rsquo;s nobody that she\u0026rsquo;s going to slip away with. But she\u0026rsquo;s a fucking hottie. She\u0026rsquo;s this- this, like, gorgeous, very feminine, very feminine, um– like, she– her hair is long– like usually, of course, she has it up because she\u0026rsquo;s in a military setting. But tonight, her long hair is down. She\u0026rsquo;s like, like small fat, very curvy, and just beautiful. And she\u0026rsquo;s as glamorous as sort of, like, her condition– you– being on this- this military ship will allow. Like, she\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s, like, gone all out on her makeup. It\u0026rsquo;s probably a way, like, I\u0026rsquo;ve never really seen her before, actually.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s very popular. But she\u0026rsquo;s kind of– I think partly because she\u0026rsquo;s highly ranked, partly because she feels the burden of being one of the leaders on this station very keenly. She\u0026rsquo;s just kind of, to some degree, not in the mood. Maybe a little bit because there\u0026rsquo;s somebody that she likes, even if she hasn\u0026rsquo;t admitted it to herself. [Stage whisper:] And that someone is me.\nShe doesn\u0026rsquo;t partner up is what I\u0026rsquo;m saying, but she has a lot of kind of sexy dances with people. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m jealous of that. Well, I\u0026rsquo;m not jealous in the sense of, like, being jealous of Tamsin\u0026rsquo;s attention. I think it doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur to me to be, because even though I love Tamsin at this point, I know I can\u0026rsquo;t be a partner to her in that way. Or I think that I can\u0026rsquo;t be a partner to her in that way.\nI\u0026rsquo;m jealous that I can\u0026rsquo;t dance with her. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m jealous about. I\u0026rsquo;m jealous that I can\u0026rsquo;t dance, but I\u0026rsquo;m not jealous that other people like her or that she might like somebody else.\nAnd, uh, I think that that leads… huh. That night, as the night winds down and she\u0026rsquo;s sobered up because she probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t sober the entire time. She comes to say good night to me. And is kind of like, you know, \u0026ldquo;Oh, like, what did you think of seeing your first dance?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd yeah, I think I\u0026rsquo;m honest. I\u0026rsquo;m, uh– probably pretty guileless, really. You know, I\u0026rsquo;m probably pretty open about things.\nI just say– I say sort of what I just said, right? Except for I don\u0026rsquo;t– I think the one thing I will not say to her is that I love her, because it feels like too much to put on her. But I\u0026rsquo;ll just say, like, \u0026ldquo;That was– it was amazing. I really enjoyed it. It was beautiful. It looked like so much fun. I really wish that- that I could dance like that.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd… I think she sort of gets sly and there\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of people around, and there\u0026rsquo;s, uh– somebody has to be on duty, right? So I think she just climbs into the cockpit and seals the cockpit up and, uh, like, calls to the flight controller or whatever, like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m taking Adze-E out.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;W-why? Is this a patrol?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s just like, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. Because it\u0026rsquo;s- yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s Tamsin. It\u0026rsquo;s Lieutenant– what did I name her? Lieutenant Commander Calder. And she gets what she wants.\nShe probably has a call sign. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to think about that.\nAnd we fly out into space and, um… I think it\u0026rsquo;s a little experimental. She says something like, uh, \u0026ldquo;Alright, so it takes– it takes two people to dance. So, um… I am going to control our maneuvering and you are going to control our thrusters.\u0026rdquo; And she just, is just kind of like, let\u0026rsquo;s- let\u0026rsquo;s see what that\u0026rsquo;s like.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s interesting actually. Like it is– because it does give us both a lot of- a lot of input. Because I can, by increasing or decreasing our thrust, I can change our turning radius. Um, so, uh, I can turn a sort of gentle curve into a tight loop by increasing or decreasing speed. And you know, obviously she\u0026rsquo;s ultimately, like, leading where we go.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s fun. It\u0026rsquo;s really fun. And I think it feels very intimate.\nAnd, uh, as we\u0026rsquo;re going back to the ship, I say, \u0026ldquo;Is that what dancing\u0026rsquo;s like?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a very different kind of dancing than I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done before. But yeah. I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of what dancing\u0026rsquo;s like.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, uh, yeah. And she parks me and we say good night. And she asks if I want to switch off for the night or not. And I say no. And, uh… I just think a lot about dancing that night. I think a lot about dancing. And about her. And I think I also think about the things that we don\u0026rsquo;t have or don\u0026rsquo;t do. And the biggest thing is touch. Because… I think that touching is a lot of what seems special to me about dancing. Yeah.\nI have to mark my chassis. [Giggle]\nOkay. I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw like a really– I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw like little stick figures. But, um, I want you to know that this represents what she puts on my chassis after this, which is another stencil of this– two women in silhouette, like, dancing like crazy. Like, um, not touching, but like standing next to each other and just fucking like jamming out. Like, dance like nobody\u0026rsquo;s watching style. Yeah.\nI think she puts that over my heart. The comet was on my arm.\nBRIANNA: Twenty. \u0026ldquo;When they told you what they fight for.\u0026rdquo; Huh.\nThey told me… I think… we were training at this point. The thing about being what we were is that there was a lot of preamble toward before getting out there to try to kill the enemy ace. They didn\u0026rsquo;t want the enemies to know what they had developed.\nMy pilot was still… frustrated. Still felt that… I guess, from my perspective, it seemed like she still felt like this was beneath her. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t what she should be doing. But I wanted… to understand why, because to me, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing greater than the purpose we were built for. Or I guess I was built for. Mm… no. That we were made for.\nAnd so while we were in the midst of a simulation, I asked, I said… I always used to call her, like, Sergeant. Um, I don\u0026rsquo;t think she was a Sergeant, but I always called her Sergeant. At least at first.\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Sergeant.\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: Yes?\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Why… do you feel this is beneath you?\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: I- I never said I feel this is beneath me. Why do you think I think that?\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. I must have misunderstood. Why… is this not what you… wish to be doing?\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: \u0026lsquo;Cause it\u0026rsquo;s not what I signed up for. Don\u0026rsquo;t you know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing out there? How much have they told you?\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Ah… tell… me?\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: Jesus, they haven\u0026rsquo;t even told you. They– so they just made you, huh? They just made you and… that\u0026rsquo;s just supposed to be– good enough?\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Ah… I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I have purpose. I need nothing more than purpose.\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: No, you don\u0026rsquo;t have purpose; you have programming. You have rules imbued in you. I have purpose. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen what they did to us. I have seen the water get tainted, the crops rotting. I have seen the plague they unleashed upon the world to try to keep us in fucking line. I have seen why we fight.\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Why do you fight?\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: Because once I had a family. Now I don\u0026rsquo;t anymore.\nBRIANNA: And she sort of– I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I ever saw her cry, but I heard in her voice, her stopping herself from crying. And she says,\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: Once I had a home and a family and a life. I… I used to fight like hell for us to get by. And eventually, they made it clear that us just getting by just wasn\u0026rsquo;t– wasn\u0026rsquo;t something they could allow. So now I\u0026rsquo;m here. And I\u0026rsquo;m here to kill that… kill as many of those motherfuckers as I can take. I don\u0026rsquo;t… I… yeah.\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Is there something that you were going to say?\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: No, damn it. Focus. Let\u0026rsquo;s get back to– we have work to do.\nWe have work to do.\nBRIANNA: Doing another tally…\nGAME: MEMORY THREE DEE: \u0026ldquo;The sunrise you watch together.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to skip that one because it feels a lot like- it feels a lot like watching a comet together.\n\u0026ldquo;How they\u0026rdquo;– the one right above that on the list is \u0026ldquo;How they helped you understand the weight of taking a life.\u0026rdquo; Oh boy. Um, that\u0026rsquo;s really good. Um, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to do that.\nHow did they help me understand the weight of taking a life?\nI think this was very early. This was close to the comet night. And, um… because I think it\u0026rsquo;s important for this that Tamsin start to have a sense of my emerging– like, the fact that I am a person.\nAnd we go out into a really tough, crazy mission. You know– so our– the mission that I was designed for is attacking a fortress, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s like, I\u0026rsquo;m like the- the heaviest of heavies. I like, I go out into just, like, crazy amounts of fire and I dish out a huge amount of punishment to like, to- to- to bring down these really heavy defenses.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to say this happened on Earth. The Firenze can be on Earth, right? Like, it can, it can go through reentry and, um, it\u0026rsquo;s got, you know, whatever magic anti-gravity technology it, um– it can sort of like, uh, float over the landscape. This is very, very Gundam of course. Um, but, uh, that technology is not strong enough to, like, get us– um, like we- we couldn\u0026rsquo;t get, uh– we couldn\u0026rsquo;t escape Earth\u0026rsquo;s gravity.\nSo we deployed from the Firenze to this just, like, this massive fortress that was a key spot in defending, like, the- the Coalition of Luna\u0026rsquo;s holdings on Earth, right? \u0026lsquo;Cause I said before that they- they need, um, like a source of water, air, like all of these things that we don\u0026rsquo;t have on the moon necessarily.\nUm, and this is a key– we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re part of an offensive to sort of chip away at that territory. And, uh, we attack this huge fortress that they\u0026rsquo;ve built with walls and turrets and all of this very like, uh, sci-fi like, uh, stuff… like turrets, like, uh, like rise out of the ground and then descend into the ground so you can\u0026rsquo;t take them out. Um, and it\u0026rsquo;s all laid out as this, like, you know- so that you have to cross this field of fire. This, like, killing ground. And that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s what we have to do.\nUm, it\u0026rsquo;s the– it\u0026rsquo;s the Adze-E and, um, I think the first production models are coming online at this point. So there are a few other Adzes with us, and Tamsin, as, like, the veteran in using this kind of model, she leads this mission across this, uh, this no man\u0026rsquo;s land. This, like, open ground that\u0026rsquo;s been created to destroy attackers.\nAnd we, like– we are taking– I am taking heavy hits. But I\u0026rsquo;m designed to take heavy hits. And uh, we, we achieve our mission.\nI think one of the Adze-P\u0026rsquo;s, you know, gets– not destroyed, but, like, seriously damaged. Um, I\u0026rsquo;m kind of picturing this as like– like, it\u0026rsquo;s like when tanks were first deployed in World War One, people didn\u0026rsquo;t quite know how to use them, so– and they were kind of unreliable. So they would, like, break down in the middle of an offensive, um. So something sort of like that, right? Like one takes a hard hit in a weak point, like a joint, and it\u0026rsquo;s kind of stuck in the middle of no man\u0026rsquo;s land. But, um you know. We\u0026rsquo;re able to press on.\nAnd you know, we get close enough that we\u0026rsquo;re able to– like, I\u0026rsquo;m able to like unload with this, uh– I think it\u0026rsquo;s an un-integrated cannon, but like– I\u0026rsquo;m– this is- I\u0026rsquo;m very much drawing this from Gundam Heavyarms from Gundam Wing. Um, it had this, like, huge cannon that could– it could sort of hold onto, that it could then, like, drop. Um, I\u0026rsquo;ve got this, like, huge cannon that, uh– that I carry at my right hand, that I can drop when I\u0026rsquo;m done with. Make it the left hand because I\u0026rsquo;m left handed and I want it to be on my left hand. Uh, so I\u0026rsquo;m, like, laying down waste with this cannon and like these- these huge shells are popping out and like the plates are opening up in my- my chest, like, armor\u0026rsquo;s like- like poking open and like a bunch of missiles fly out.\nAnd we just, yeah. Like this- this team of- of Adzes is totally up to the challenge of this heavy fortress, um. And there\u0026rsquo;s all of these explosions that are so satisfying for the viewers at home. And the mission is, you know, on the whole, a huge success. And it\u0026rsquo;s– I think it\u0026rsquo;s, like, a big vindication of Tamsin\u0026rsquo;s work and the- like, the whole class of mechs, and, like, now there\u0026rsquo;s going to be more Adzes.\nAnd um, in the aftermath of this- is like, our infantry moves in and takes control of the fortress. The– all of the Adzes just get parked, um, you know, like, once the- the area is clear outside of the fortress. So we\u0026rsquo;re all just standing there. And Tamsin goes inside and is– she\u0026rsquo;s not like part of the assault, right, but like, she goes, and there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a mobile command center set up and she\u0026rsquo;s getting debriefed. Um, and uh, there, you know– now we have, like, fucking showers and dorms and stuff in this fortress. So she\u0026rsquo;s probably, like, getting rest after this combat mission.\nAnd um, when she comes back… I think we parted on this, like really nice– in this really nice way where she was- she was happy because we\u0026rsquo;d succeeded, and it was– like I said, it was a big vindication of like her investment in this project, like this new model testing, you know, of piloting the experimental model and being successful on missions. And now our first sort of, like, big official mission is out of the way.\nWe parted in this– like, she was really happy. And she comes back and she\u0026rsquo;s really tight lipped. And… I think I, like– being very well-meaning, am kind of, um, chipper, and kind of like, uh, you know, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh! Like, were the generals happy?\u0026rdquo; Like I\u0026rsquo;m, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m sort of like burbling all of these excited questions. And…\nShe is very short with me and eventually… well, I mean, yeah. I think I\u0026rsquo;m just hurt. And she sort of has this like– I get very robotic, right? I\u0026rsquo;m just like– this is how I deal with being hurt. I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of like, I\u0026rsquo;ve started, like, only answering her queries, um, with like, you know, like a monotone and… um, oh gosh, what\u0026rsquo;s my voice like?\nI think she– you know, like, she obviously interacts with me in, like, the function of the mech and, like, the actually piloting me, um, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of like, you know– I\u0026rsquo;m, like, powering her heads up display and all of the information on her– that shows on her system. But I also just have a voice and we just talk. And I think… yeah, I mean, I think we\u0026rsquo;re– I think it has a Siri quality, right? It\u0026rsquo;s just this kind of like– it\u0026rsquo;s mostly this kind of pleasant woman\u0026rsquo;s voice. But she has noticed that I have a lot more range of expression than she expected. That I can sound worried or, um, or sad, um. Or hurt. Yeah, but usually, like, when I- when I feel hurt, usually I don\u0026rsquo;t sound it. Usually I get very, uh– I get very withdrawn and I just try to be like a– [Voice drops into a miserable mocking tone:] machine who doesn\u0026rsquo;t– doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean to take up space from you…\nSo I think what she does is, um… we just have to return to- to Firenze, but she takes a detour. And goes to one of the outlying- the outlying fortifications, um, like, this big turret that we, uh, that we destroyed.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s like a– it\u0026rsquo;s like an, uh, like an old battleship turret. When I was a kid, I remember touring like a battleship, like a World War Two era battleship and they had, you know, these big, huge steel turrets that were fully enclosed. And she brings me over to- to something like that, um, where it\u0026rsquo;s like a– you know, a big gun sticking out of a– a big cylinder. And we blew this thing up. And, um, she– using my- my hands, she rips– she rips this thing open so that we can see inside.\nAnd, uh, there\u0026rsquo;s a gun crew. Um, you know, there were, there were people in this turret making it work. And then when we destroyed it, they all died.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m kind of like, \u0026ldquo;Why are you showing me this?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s really angry. And she\u0026rsquo;s not really angry at me. I think at this moment, she is angry at me, because she\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s angry that I don\u0026rsquo;t understand this thing that is really important to being a person, which is that we did harm.\nAnd I think she just like– you know, I\u0026rsquo;m looking at these, the bodies of these- these people, and she is just like, \u0026ldquo;They were all like me.\u0026rdquo; No, you know what she says? \u0026ldquo;They were all like you or me. They were all people. They all thought about the future.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;Cause this is right after the comet things. \u0026ldquo;They all thought about what they were going to do after the war, and we killed them.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m sort of– um, I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;But it was our- our mission. They were the enemy.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she says, um. \u0026ldquo;Yeah. And they were people. Now they\u0026rsquo;re dead.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, um, I think I have a lot– I don\u0026rsquo;t say anything at that moment. I think I just get quiet and we\u0026rsquo;re both quiet for a long time. And then she goes. She- she drives us back to base.\nUm, it\u0026rsquo;s a long time. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we ever talk about it. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m ever like, \u0026ldquo;I was thinking about that time you showed me the bodies in the turret,\u0026rdquo; but I think about it a lot because I– this is like a– I think in a lot of ways, this is not just how I learn about death, but it is how I learn about ambiguity. Um, because I have to deal with the fact that we did the right thing; we followed our programming, quote unquote– in, like, in my terms– we- we did the assignment and there was something wrong with that.\nAnd… yeah like I said, we never talk about it, but I think eventually Tamsin– like it becomes clear to Tamsin over time that I incorporate– that I- I did think about it, and that I did learn a lesson from it. Yeah. So it is a big moment in our relationship.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to mark my chassis. With… something that\u0026rsquo;s a symbol of hope. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a symbol of hope for Tamsin that she won\u0026rsquo;t have to fight forever. And I think the symbol she chooses… it\u0026rsquo;s a shuttle. It\u0026rsquo;s a, um– it\u0026rsquo;s like a civilian craft. So it\u0026rsquo;s like sleek… it has, um, kind of like a space shuttle, it has like little wings for, um, when it has to move for an atmosphere. It\u0026rsquo;s got some maneuvering fins. And it\u0026rsquo;s just like a civilian ship for moving people around the moon, moving people, like, around the solar system, which is the kind of thing she wanted to fly before the war.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s done– the one that I drew on my arm isn\u0026rsquo;t like this, but it\u0026rsquo;s, uh– it\u0026rsquo;s done in this very cool style, right? Like, people won\u0026rsquo;t see it necessarily and think this is kind of a protest against the war. They\u0026rsquo;ll think like, oh, she\u0026rsquo;s, like, kind of bragging that she\u0026rsquo;s a cool pilot, and she loves- loves flying and is so skillful. But she knows what it means. And I think I maybe don\u0026rsquo;t initially know what it means. But eventually I do.\nMaybe this is the first– \u0026lsquo;cause this is before she- she stencils the dancing women on me. I think this is the first time she introduces colour. So I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m like, very gray. The comet, she did in white and the shuttle is in, um– hm. It\u0026rsquo;s in white, purple, and yellow. And it\u0026rsquo;s the first splash of colour on my chassis. And I think that the- the women were a deep blue against like, a pink background that was part of the stencil. So I get more colourful over time.\nSATAH: I made a sandwich. And check this out. [Can cracking] It\u0026rsquo;s a caffeinated soda, baby! Let\u0026rsquo;s… [Laughing] let\u0026rsquo;s get wild! It\u0026rsquo;s been in my fridge for ages because I can\u0026rsquo;t… just can\u0026rsquo;t really do caffeine like I used to now that I\u0026rsquo;m properly medicated. And a hundred years old.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s roll! Let\u0026rsquo;s roll for a prompt. [Laughing]\n[Die clattering] All right. I rolled a two. So this is going to be from eleven to twenty… [Die clattering] and a four. So. Fourteen, \u0026ldquo;the storm you got caught in.\u0026rdquo; Ooh.\nSo… I think… probably because I was just talking about them doing a stakeout, I think that what this is is that we are, like, behind enemy lines in some way and the storm is… an electrical storm of some kind… or some sort of like space phenomena that… essentially makes it very difficult to– or, it makes it essentially impossible or very, very, very dangerous to take off, to leave. And I think there is interference on planet as well, like… definitely messing with electrics.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where it\u0026rsquo;s like– we have no idea if they\u0026rsquo;ll discover us? Like, we\u0026rsquo;ve been spying or, uh, sabotaging or doing- doing something and we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be able to just– we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to just leave, because we could be discovered.\nMaybe that\u0026rsquo;s what it is– ooh, yeah. So, it was a sabotage mission specifically. And again, all of this has to be very focused on… the… like, defeating the ace. Like, that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m good at. But this was, like, going behind enemy lines and… oh, it was like destroying spare parts. The enemy ace has, like, a very unique custom mech that… runs, in part, off of, like, very old parts they don\u0026rsquo;t make anymore. And they\u0026rsquo;ve been slowly, like, building a hoard of backups so that they can keep going for as long as possible. And we had– the- the mission that we were on was to go in and just destroy those backups. Or as many of them as we can.\nAnd we go in and we do that. And as we are going to escape, this huge storm comes up. And so we\u0026rsquo;re trapped. And we have no idea, like– we don\u0026rsquo;t know if alarms went off, if they already know we\u0026rsquo;re here, if they\u0026rsquo;re going to come find us. Kind of our only hope is that the storm is also fucking with them– which, like– enough that they won\u0026rsquo;t be able to get to us. If they even know we\u0026rsquo;re here. And maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t.\nAnd I think we\u0026rsquo;re also trying to look on the bright side and being like, maybe it will look like the storm did this? Like, if they don\u0026rsquo;t know that we\u0026rsquo;re here, if none of the alarms went off, if they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any hidden sensors… it could look like this wasn\u0026rsquo;t intentional sabotage, that this was just a random act of nature. And that\u0026rsquo;s always good. Just any leg up, right? Like, if they found it and knew that it had been sabotaged, then they would know that we knew, which means that they have a leak somewhere, or that we have, like, a pipeline of information that they weren\u0026rsquo;t previously aware of. So it could be good. But. We have to live in that uncertainty for several hours on this planet.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re, like, hidden under a cliff. The- the hoard was in some, like, industrial warehouse in the middle of nowhere type of thing. And we are like– we can\u0026rsquo;t get that far away, but we\u0026rsquo;re trying to not be directly there, but there\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of cover, and trying to, uh, hit the balance between… hiding somewhere in limited cover and not hiding in the only place that they would look because it\u0026rsquo;s the only cover.\nAnd… we just have to sit there. And we can\u0026rsquo;t relax. Like this can\u0026rsquo;t be like, \u0026ldquo;Ah, the storm\u0026rsquo;s happening. We can\u0026rsquo;t do anything. Oh well, it\u0026rsquo;s out of our hands. Let\u0026rsquo;s kind of chill.\u0026rdquo; We have to be on high alert the entire time. We have to be watching the storm. We have to be, like, trying to see if anybody is coming to us. We have to be scanning to see if anyone is near, if they\u0026rsquo;ve discovered us, anything that we can pick up. And so it\u0026rsquo;s very high tension and long.\nAnd I think… there is a moment where I raise the idea that there is… that this is only really dangerous for me? Like, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be pleasant for a human to walk out there, especially– I\u0026rsquo;m sure that a lot of these humans are, like, quite augmented– it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be pleasant, but it would be possible. And that she could get out and go and find another way off planet, or at least hide farther away from me. That\u0026rsquo;s part of it too is like– I\u0026rsquo;m way easier to find than she would be if she were on her own. And so she could go and… first I suggest, leave the planet, and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Nope.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, well you could at least– I\u0026rsquo;ve been, you know, I have some old– I have some maps that from scanning- from before the storm came up and interfered with all of that. You could go and you could hide here. This is a place that a human would fit. They\u0026rsquo;d never find you. I won\u0026rsquo;t fit.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd just like… a few moments of that– a conversation where she just repeatedly is like– makes it very, very clear that she is not going anywhere. That we are doing this together. That there is no world that she envisions in which she goes off and is safe but I\u0026rsquo;m not. That that isn\u0026rsquo;t even real safety to her. That it- that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t– that it\u0026rsquo;s essentially pointless. Like getting your leg caught in a bear trap and, uh, trying to avoid cutting off your leg by cutting off your leg. Something like that. She just makes that very clear.\nAnd… probably? Probably I should be a little more insistent. But the reality is… there are pilots where the logical execution of my programming would be… \u0026ldquo;You are more important than me. You have to go.\u0026rdquo; And in this case… she isn\u0026rsquo;t. She is important. I mean- she\u0026rsquo;s more important than me because a human is going to be more important than mechs, you know, overall, generally. But… by the structure of command… she isn\u0026rsquo;t. And so I can absolutely internally logically justify not pushing her to leave. Which is great. \u0026lsquo;Cause I don\u0026rsquo;t want her to because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be alone in this storm where I can\u0026rsquo;t do anything, where all my sensors are fucked and my radar is bad and there\u0026rsquo;s no escape for me and I just wait to be discovered. I don\u0026rsquo;t want that. That sucks. I- I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m so happy that she wants to stay. And luckily, I\u0026rsquo;m able to allow her to.\nAnd eventually the storm ends and we leave. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think that we know yet what– like, how much we got away with. And either that\u0026rsquo;ll be sort of an open question or maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll– maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll– that\u0026rsquo;ll tie into an answer later. We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nBRIANNA: Twelve. \u0026ldquo;How they helped you understand the weight of taking a life.\u0026rdquo;\nThis was… our final, um, simulation before we were supposed to be… deployed for our first mission. The idea was we were to basically simulate, from start to finish, exactly what, um, it would be like. And by this time– I think, from what I remember, things had gotten a little friendlier, but there was always this- this element of… you know. She was very closed off. And so it was- it was very much- it was still business.\nIt was how I started. I said, \u0026ldquo;Scale the wall. The target should be in there. We shall eliminate the target and… be ready for action.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she sort of… [Snort-laughs] snorted out kind of a laugh. And I had said, \u0026ldquo;Why do you laugh? Is something funny?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she says, \u0026ldquo;You… you say that like it\u0026rsquo;s the easiest thing in the world. Just killing someone. \u0026lsquo;Eliminate a target.\u0026rsquo; It\u0026rsquo;s like… I mean, of course you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. How– how could you possibly.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: I understand. One moment, there are enemies and then the next they are gone, and there is peace.\nBRIANNA: And she says,\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: The fact that you think that\u0026rsquo;s all that is, is proof you really don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Then help me understand.\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: [Snidely] Help you understand.\nYou know, first time I took a life, those bastards had moved in to our town. Came in with a pack of them looking for dissidents. They decided I was one of them– I wasn\u0026rsquo;t at the time. I mean, I guess I was– I was, you know. I was an organiser, I guess. You know– labour, you know about labour, yeah?\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: I am… familiar with the concept of labour, yes.\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: D\u0026rsquo;you know about… unions, labour organising– you know what? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. I– it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. The point is, it was my job, help people work together, get what they wanted. And… they didn\u0026rsquo;t like that. They thought that I was \u0026ldquo;fomenting dissidence\u0026rdquo;. Suffice to say, they, uh… they had me arrested. Locked in some room. What they didn\u0026rsquo;t account for, though, was that I was not in fact the one fomenting dissidence; that there was other dissidence out there they hadn\u0026rsquo;t caught. And those dissidents came busted down their door.\nAnd in the chaos, I saw a moment. I saw– his gun was so close. Was right there. And I just… I took– I went with my arms and I just– I stood up, I grabbed it, I turned around and just, without even looking, just shot him. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even look–\nBRIANNA: She kind of, like, puts her hand over her face.\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: I didn\u0026rsquo;t even look at him. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even look at his eyes. We had our backs to each other and I shot him.\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Why is that significant?\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: What, that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t facing him?\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: Yes.\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: Tch… I mean– when we go out there and we shoot whoever\u0026rsquo;s out there– that enemy– that ace– the one that they… the one that they call…\nBRIANNA: I have to come up with a name for the enemy ace. Um…\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: The one they call Hurricane. When we go out there and we face down that Hurricane, you\u0026rsquo;ll understand why it\u0026rsquo;s important to look someone in the eye. It\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a– it\u0026rsquo;s respect, I think.\nBRIANNA, AS THE MECH: How can you respect someone and kill them?\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: Heh. You know, Sapphire… that\u0026rsquo;s a great question.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: Sapphire?\nBRIANNA, AS SERGEANT: Well yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s your name, ain\u0026rsquo;t it? Sapphire system mark eight seven two. You know. You\u0026rsquo;re Sapphire.\nBRIANNA: Oh, you know what? I\u0026rsquo;m going to cut it there. There\u0026rsquo;s a third tick. Um… sort of write down the things that I established. So, Sapphire… Sergeant… we\u0026rsquo;ll get back to that, I think. And Hurricane is the enemy\u0026rsquo;s ace.\nAnd I think fittingly, with the name Hurricane, I think I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to choose this next one. I know I\u0026rsquo;m switching it up. Not rolling, just just going with it, going with the flow.\nGAME: MEMORY FOUR BRIANNA: I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with fourteen, which is \u0026ldquo;The storm you got caught in.\u0026rdquo; And this is a memory of our first attempt to kill Hurricane.\nEverything was as we thought it would be as we approached the fortress where Hurricane supposedly was. We- we\u0026rsquo;d gotten some intel here that they were waiting to deploy Hurricane. Usually they deployed Hurricane, we were told, immediately, but this time they were holding them back and it seemed like a perfect opportunity, so we were deployed.\nEven for a mech, the simulations really don\u0026rsquo;t line up with what\u0026rsquo;s real until you feel it, until you see the terror and confusion of combat. You don\u0026rsquo;t understand what it means, not just to take a life, but any of it. None of it is real until you\u0026rsquo;re in it.\nAnd… even us, whose job was to just move through it, to approach, to move quickly and swiftly, to burrow through the ground or fly through the air, which we both did– which we did both of, along the way. This kind of masterful stealth piloting that my Sergeant– even if– even though she said as much, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t a stealth pilot, that… she did a fantastic job at moving. At just going wherever she needed to go as quick and as best as we can. We did not take a shot. They didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the chance to fire at us as we climbed up the walls of that fortress until suddenly we were in a hangar, a hangar that they had set aside for Hurricane and his mech.\nAnd… ultimately we had known… Hurricane\u0026rsquo;s mech is big. It was the biggest on the field on either side. But you don\u0026rsquo;t understand the scale of it until you\u0026rsquo;re in it.\nOur job was simple. Fly up, climb up, find some way to get up there, slash through the mech where Intel believed Hurricane was.\nBut something went wrong. When we arrived, we saw Hurricane\u0026rsquo;s mech, but when we tried to climb it, we went right through. And then we heard a laugh.\nBRIANNA, AS HURRICANE: [Dark chuckle] Oh, my dears, you have been led astray. You are, of course, entirely where we want you to be, without even realising it. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame I won\u0026rsquo;t get to see you face to face, but I shall certainly enjoy watching what comes next.\nBRIANNA: And before– as soon as he started speaking, my sergeant went, \u0026ldquo;No, fuck, fuck, it\u0026rsquo;s a trap. We need to go! Go! Move.\u0026rdquo; And we immediately started trying to run out of there. I think if- if- if we hadn\u0026rsquo;t, I don\u0026rsquo;t– I think they would have got us, because as soon as we were running, they were firing from outside the hangar in– just a– a hail of bullets, just everywhere, trying desperately to get us from all angles. Like we were on a firing squad, and from every angle.\nWe were moving so quickly and so perfectly through them like we\u0026rsquo;d– like we were born, made, to move together. But when we tried to leap, blow a hole in the hangar door and leap out, we found ourselves face to face with a helicopter firing a missile directly into us.\nMy systems went down for a moment. All I remember thinking was desperately… desperately, in some core part of me, no longer conscious, no longer alive, some core part of me saying, \u0026ldquo;Sergeant, you need to go, you need to leave, you need to flee, get out, get out, get out.\u0026rdquo;\nBut she did not flee or leave or anything. She, um. She stayed there and tried to get me up and running again. And eventually she did. And as soon as she turned me on, I said, \u0026ldquo;Sergeant. Sergeant. You must go. You must leave.\u0026rdquo;\nTo which she replied, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to leave you, Sapphire.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd… she was rummaging inside of me, inside of my systems, trying to put me back together well enough for us to make one last leap.\nSoldiers were descending now, trying to corner us in. I kept track of them, my sensors one of the few things about me still working.\nI said, \u0026ldquo;Get my weapons operational; I will buy you time.\u0026rdquo; And I did.\nWell, she did. And I did.\nI fired enough, whoever was running, getting closest to me, just in time for her to get my legs moving again. She… whooped and hollered and I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand. She was– we were in such danger and she seemed so alive. Later, I remember asking her, \u0026ldquo;Why were you so excited when you got it working again? When you got me working again?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she said, \u0026ldquo;Because this time I knew we were all going to make it out.\u0026rdquo;\n[Sound of marker opening to make another tally on her chassis]\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s roll for memory number four. [Die clattering] Got a two, so results eleven to twenty. [Die clattering] One, so that is eleven. [Wounded chuckle] Oh… \u0026ldquo;Where you were when you realised you loved them.\u0026rdquo; Ohh…\nIs this before or after the storm? After. Because during the storm, I was still leaning a lot on the internal algorithms, not necessarily trusting– not trusting my feelings, very explicitly not trusting my feelings, and not using feelings as a reason to do anything. But still very much pretending that I could hide all of this behind some sort of a logical expression of my programming and is what is necessary.\nWhere you were… I can\u0026rsquo;t decide if I want this to be big or really small because both are so possible. Like it can be a huge fight or a big, dangerous life saving thing, but it can also be something tiny, a very small moment. Generally, I\u0026rsquo;m very drawn to the small moment thing. And so that\u0026rsquo;s my first… instinct, like that would be the most natural path for me, but I\u0026rsquo;m trying to decide if actually I want this to be a little bit bigger.\nI think also in part because this is about halfway through the scenes, this will be our first confrontation with the enemy ace. Who I should… probably name… what thematic mirroring should the enemy ace\u0026rsquo;s name have to do with my pilot\u0026rsquo;s? \u0026lsquo;Cause we could do opposites. Like Brig Cadaver could be… [Sputtering in disbelief of what they\u0026rsquo;re about to say] Freedom Alive… [Laughing] that\u0026rsquo;s very stupid, uhh. Or could also be the mirror of like… uh… Capture Decay.\nSo the mirror I think can\u0026rsquo;t be exact because they actually are in very different circumstances. I suspect the enemy ace is a trained pilot. And has been for a very long time. Maybe has– maybe there will be some similarities. Like they have– they have an unusual background for a pilot? But still they\u0026rsquo;ve been a pilot for a very long time. And unusual could mean a lot of things. Like, it could be a cultural thing where… they come from a poor background, you know? Like they– usually the only people who get into the academy are super rich kids and they… had a– like, a scholarship or something like that, you know, depending– this– and a lot of this, I\u0026rsquo;m– it depends on, like, the genre of the show and what it\u0026rsquo;s exploring.\nBut I like- yeah, I like the idea that they have an unusual background, but are still very much a trained pilot. They weren\u0026rsquo;t a mechanic, but they… they were an academic? Yeah. They were an academic studying the sapience– the emergence of sapience in machinery. And then through some sort of circumstances… probably a classic, almost like the Charlie Day in Pacific Rim, \u0026ldquo;fuck it, I\u0026rsquo;m going to drift with the kaiju\u0026rdquo; type thing, ended up becoming a pilot and a vital part of- of- of the– becoming the top pilot– becoming thee pilot. Which is also interesting because that, like… I wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s– there\u0026rsquo;s an element there of– I wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s almost a yearning where it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Wow, your top pilot is somebody who very much recognises the personhood of mechs.\u0026rdquo; Which, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s not even true! Maybe because they\u0026rsquo;re an academic, they don\u0026rsquo;t, because they think that they understand the mechanics behind it, so they\u0026rsquo;re– they have convinced themself to dismiss it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m getting very lost in the sauce when it comes to defining the enemy ace. I admit that I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding the prompt. [Laughs] I should still give them a name. I think they\u0026rsquo;re going to be a doctor? And maybe we don\u0026rsquo;t know their name. Maybe we just know their callsign and maybe we\u0026rsquo;re just– like, well, we might learn their name– [Garold meowing] hi, buddy– at some point. Garold\u0026rsquo;s got suggestions. But maybe let\u0026rsquo;s just call them Doc.\nAnd I know for a fact that if I looked at enemy mech names right now, I would be doing avoidance. So I\u0026rsquo;m just going to write \u0026ldquo;enemy mech name\u0026rdquo; and I will come up with it at some point.\nSo. We had an initial showdown with Doc. And we didn\u0026rsquo;t… win, but I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t think we were in mortal danger. I don\u0026rsquo;t want this to be a thing where I realised that I love Brig because she nearly died.\nThe showdown itself was interrupted through some sort of external circumstance… and… what went down in it? We did actually fight. But what was the conversation beforehand? One possibility I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of is Doc… trying to recruit us. But maybe Doc doesn\u0026rsquo;t know enough about us yet to do that.\nI think whatever it was… as the conversation sort of deteriorated towards fighting, Doc makes a snide remark about me? Like, she comments on me obviously being custom and says that that must be a sign that our side is running out of options. Running out of resources in some way. This is a fight over resources, which I haven\u0026rsquo;t fully defined yet– I think I maybe can- I can- I can get there. Not, not this time, but shortly.\nSo Doc, like, is making fun of my construction. And Brig… defends me, right? Like she even throws some of Doc\u0026rsquo;s experience back in her face of like, \u0026ldquo;You of all people should know that anything can be hidden inside a machine\u0026rdquo; kind of thing. Like is very much like, \u0026ldquo;Fuck you. There are hidden depths to my mech that you can\u0026rsquo;t see.\u0026rdquo; Which is partially defending me, and I think also a threat. It\u0026rsquo;s very cleverly done to be like both, \u0026ldquo;Hey, shut up. That\u0026rsquo;s my friend.\u0026rdquo; Heavy emphasis, italics on friend, quotes. And also being like, \u0026ldquo;You have no idea what you\u0026rsquo;re up against. Yes, this is custom. That isn\u0026rsquo;t a sign that we\u0026rsquo;re weak. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a sign that you should be very careful.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think… I\u0026rsquo;m very affected by… her defending me instead of using it as an opportunity to gloat about her own prowess as a pilot and to gloat about herself. That she doesn\u0026rsquo;t just see me as an extension of herself such that, like, an insult to me is an insult to her, which she should defend on her own merits. She sees me as my own being that deserves to be defended– who deserves to have my valour protected on my own merits, not just for her pride.\nAnd I start to have the realisation right then. But then the fighting breaks out, right? And… that\u0026rsquo;s– yes, that\u0026rsquo;s what it is. It starts– we\u0026rsquo;re in the, like– incredible, like, showdown type shots, you know? We\u0026rsquo;re, like, standing across from each other. It looks like we could be about to, uh, take ten steps and then duel kind of thing. I start to realise it there. And then… after the fight, something else happens. It\u0026rsquo;s like, there\u0026rsquo;s– not literally this, but the equivalent of like– if we were fighting in a tunnel, there\u0026rsquo;s a tunnel collapse that stops us from being able to get to each other, and so we just have to stop fighting. It\u0026rsquo;s not under our control.\nAnd after that… we\u0026rsquo;re leaving and doing diagnostics and she… talks excitedly about what she learned in that fight? Like, is talking about how like, \u0026ldquo;Wow, it\u0026rsquo;s so different. You were totally right. Like all of the VR, all of the projections– like I\u0026rsquo;m glad we did that, I felt prepared– but you\u0026rsquo;re so right. It\u0026rsquo;s different doing it face to face one on one and actually feeling it, really feeling it in that moment and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so much.\u0026rdquo; And she just talks about all the stuff she learned. And I have this huge… I\u0026rsquo;m just like, yup. Okay. I\u0026rsquo;m in love with you. You are a huge dork.\n[Addressing a strange rhythmic sound] Garold\u0026rsquo;s trying to open a cupboard in the background. Sorry.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re a huge dork and you defended me and I\u0026rsquo;m in love with you.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s also that she\u0026rsquo;s feeling positive. Like she isn\u0026rsquo;t doing like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, we could have– we really could have had her that time. [Angry vocalising]\u0026rdquo; She\u0026rsquo;s just excited. She\u0026rsquo;s just excited and thinks that it went really well. And I love her.\nGarold… fuck off buddy. [Inviting tsk-ing] C\u0026rsquo;mere.\nDEE: Let\u0026rsquo;s pick another random number. Nine. \u0026ldquo;When you made a promise to them.\u0026rdquo; I like that a lot. When you made a promise to them. Hmm.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s interesting here is that like, I am a… the dark thing here that this almost makes me want to press against and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I will or not is that I\u0026rsquo;m a non-person, right? Like I\u0026rsquo;ve said this– I was saying before, like, loosely like– like there are people inside of these mechs, but legally I\u0026rsquo;m not a person. I am a mech that is the property of the military. A property of the Earth Alliance.\nAnd the reason that\u0026rsquo;s interesting is that there are a lot of promises that I could make her that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t actually be in my power to keep. This- this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be it, but what if I promise never to kill again? Like, there would come a day, probably, where I would get assigned a new pilot, who would try to use me to kill, and I would have to choose at that point between, you know, probably being disassembled, like being shut down, and- and keeping that promise.\nI think this is– this is kind of what drives this- this- this promise, actually. Um… I think what happens is that somebody dies. Somebody that- that we are close with, a fellow pilot, the Adze-Ps. Um… you know, now that that the Adze model is sort of like– its, like, proof of concept has been, has been given, uh, we are part of a unit of other Adzes that get deployed into these heavy combat situations. And, um, you know. Like, we\u0026rsquo;re not invincible. And one of us gets destroyed.\nI think that this happens in space, because it\u0026rsquo;s a situation where, um– I think that the Adzes always struggle more in space, because maneuverability is so powerful in– when there\u0026rsquo;s no gravity. So it\u0026rsquo;s like… just, somebody keeps hammering at, like, the weak spots, like at our joints, um. And, like, unless you\u0026rsquo;re really good, like Tamsin, it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult for an Adze to keep up with a suit that\u0026rsquo;s built for mobility in space and– \u0026ldquo;a suit.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;Cause this is– these are mobile suits from Gundam. With a mech that is built for mobility in space.\nAnd, uh, yeah. Eventually on a mission where we\u0026rsquo;re attacking, like, a heavily armed space station, one of the- one of the other- one of the Adze-Ps gets destroyed in a dogfight. The intelligence inside dies, you know, you would have to say, as does the pilot. And, um, gosh, like. Do I talk to the other AIs? I don\u0026rsquo;t think I really do. Like, I think that we\u0026rsquo;re not networked. So it\u0026rsquo;s very seldom that I get to interact with another one. Like there\u0026rsquo;s probably– you know what, I bet that, like, during battle, there\u0026rsquo;s a certain amount of networking, y\u0026rsquo;know, that we can like– we transmit information back and forth, but it all gets shut down while we\u0026rsquo;re back at base. It\u0026rsquo;s, like, only active in certain situations.\nBut, so– this is- this is an AI, in that case, that I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with at least, in these very stressful situations, and we\u0026rsquo;re AI so we can talk a fair amount even when all of this crazy shit is going on. Um.\nThis AI dies and this pilot dies. And, um– you know, it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily like we were best friends or that like Tamsin was best friends with him, but we were a unit. And actually Tamsin would have been his commanding officer, probably, so she feels a lot of responsibility about that. And… I think what happens– and this is actually– I think that this is a moment where I appreciate how much Tamsin has come to understand that I am a person, and also what my limitations are.\nBecause what happens is… we\u0026rsquo;re attacking this heavy target and we\u0026rsquo;re right at the end of our bombing run, right? Like, we\u0026rsquo;re like, zooming in at high speed to drop a bunch of ordnance and we\u0026rsquo;re getting shot to hell and there\u0026rsquo;s all of these smaller more nimble mechs around us, like, blasting away. And, um– it all happens in a few seconds. Over the course of like five seconds, we are ready to drop our ordnance. Tamsin is super focused on aiming, like, each individual system, like where\u0026rsquo;s each missile going to target, what are the weak points. Also, like, fucking dodging, right? Like, she\u0026rsquo;s also, at the same time, trying to keep us alive.\nAnd while that\u0026rsquo;s happening, one of our squad mates goes very quickly into like– they have a critical armor breach and then they\u0026rsquo;re destroyed. And I\u0026rsquo;m monitoring this. And it\u0026rsquo;s technically displayed to Tamsin, like, on a heads up display, like she could see that, but she doesn\u0026rsquo;t for those five seconds. And, um, I… let her take the shot because I know she\u0026rsquo;s so focused. She takes the shot and then immediately I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Tamsin, you know, um, the, uh– Lieutenant Brown\u0026rsquo;s down.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Like, because she missed– she knows that there should have been– we should have known that he was in trouble. And there\u0026rsquo;s too much going on. We don\u0026rsquo;t stop and talk about it at that point. But later when we\u0026rsquo;re back at base, she asks me to go through what happened, and I explain.\nAnd, um… it\u0026rsquo;s the fact that I can see that she\u0026rsquo;s very angry, but she doesn\u0026rsquo;t express that anger at me. She\u0026rsquo;s not like– doesn\u0026rsquo;t take it out on me. She\u0026rsquo;s very angry that I didn\u0026rsquo;t alert her the second that a member of the team was in trouble, that I made the decision to prioritise her taking the shot over us helping this teammate.\nAnd I think like I say– and I say this without guile, right? I\u0026rsquo;m just like, \u0026ldquo;Well, you were– you were very focused and we couldn\u0026rsquo;t have done anything anyway. It happened too fast, you know, so I made the determination that it was better to tell you after you took the shot.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd… I think she just says, very gravely– not in an angry way, in a grave way, \u0026ldquo;I want you to promise me that you will always prioritise our fellow soldiers over our combat objectives.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m sort of like– I think I actually say, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s against the parameters that I was programmed with.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she says, \u0026ldquo;Can you change those parameters?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I like, I have to think about this. And eventually I say, \u0026ldquo;If you ask me to, I… I could.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she says, \u0026ldquo;Will you promise me?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;Of course. Of course, Lieutenant Commander Calder,\u0026rdquo; which is what I usually call her.\nAnd she says, \u0026ldquo;Call me Tamsin.\u0026rdquo; And walks away.\nAnd… she adds… [Eyeliner cap popping] another decal to me. This one\u0026ndash; this is- this is at the end. This is, like, the latest chronological thing that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far, so I have all of the other decals, and probably a lot more. The other stencils. I keep saying decal.\nShe adds– hm. She adds something that was important to Lieutenant Brown. I think, um– I think she adds a cat. I think that she has to communicate with his fiance back on earth, you know, to give the news, and who he talked about a lot. And he also talked a lot about the fact that they have a cat together. So we draw these little cats.\nSadly, these all look much cooler in your imagination than they do on my arm. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s not sad. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s good.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. To find where you can find the show, check out foliopod.carrd.co.

He could have laid anywhere else on the bed, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t lay exactly where that box was, and so he had– he simply HAD to lose his mind. He had no other options. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that right? We\u0026rsquo;re making eye contact right now. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that right, buddy? He\u0026rsquo;s on the bed, he\u0026rsquo;s purring, he\u0026rsquo;s having a great time. Let\u0026rsquo;s find our fifth prompt. [Die clattering]\nBRIANNA: Onto round five. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll again, because I just, I think it\u0026rsquo;s fun to roll.\nDEE: Give me a random number. 13 again. Won\u0026rsquo;t trick me! I\u0026rsquo;m not doing that sunrise.\n18. Oh… \u0026ldquo;when one of you confessed your feelings for the first time.\u0026rdquo; Confessed your feelings.\nI mean, let\u0026rsquo;s be clear here: I– I love Tamsin. And when I say that, I mean, I am in love with Tamsin at a certain point, right? Like it doesn\u0026rsquo;t start that way, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, but I think by the end, I\u0026rsquo;m in love with Tamsin. I… I wish desperately that I was a human being with a body, because it would make sense for me to be in love with her. And we could do the things that I perceive that people who are in love do.\nHow do I even know about love? This is an interesting question. Um, so first of all, I think that there are, you know, there are affairs on the ship and I see them because I\u0026rsquo;m on most of the time now. I, you know, I see people being tender. Maybe people come– I bet people come to make out in the hangar bay all the time. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, interesting.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think she also, at a certain point– this is actually probably a huge moment for me that isn\u0026rsquo;t being focused on as a memory. I probably ask for, like, access to, um– like, a recreational database. And I like love stories. But I don\u0026rsquo;t fall in love with Tamsin right away. Right? I think– I think I sort of like, I\u0026rsquo;m like– maybe- maybe we could say I crush on Tamsin when that happens. I\u0026rsquo;m kind of like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, these romance stories are great. Like, ooh, like me and Tamsin are close. Like, Tamsin is my best friend. What if we were in love?\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s kind of this fun idea to try on, and it\u0026rsquo;s not something that I ever discuss.\nThis is probably– gosh, like, as I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about this, this is probably a moment of, like, huge growth for me. This is definitely after the comet conversation.\nI love having my body marked with these symbols, actually, because I can just look down and remember the game so far.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s after the dance, actually. I think that, like, a lot of what was going on with the dance, this like– this is what made me curious about these topics. About like, what is dancing all about? And of course, a lot of stories that involve dance are love stories.\nSo… yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t fall in love; I sort of, like, try on the idea of like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, this is the most important relationship in my life. Well, what if it was a love story? Ha ha!\u0026rdquo; Like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that would be so fun.\u0026rdquo;\nBut… I fall in love with her… um… it\u0026rsquo;s not when Lieutenant Brown dies. It\u0026rsquo;s that there\u0026rsquo;s another one of the Adze-Ps gets destroyed in another mission a little while after that. The circumstances are totally different, like, there\u0026rsquo;s no sort of possible culpability here. It was just a bad situation. And afterwards, she comes to talk to me and sort of asks, like– and she honestly doesn\u0026rsquo;t know, right? So she\u0026rsquo;s curious and concerned. Like she asks, \u0026ldquo;Did you have a relationship with the Adze-P?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I explain, like, it\u0026rsquo;s complicated, like a little bit, not very much. But it\u0026rsquo;s still like, really sad to know that that intelligence died. That like, somebody like me died, who I worked with. And she\u0026rsquo;s really kind to me about it. And just the fact that she thought to ask, and that she cared, I can\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking about? And… I think it\u0026rsquo;s not long after that that I decide I love her. But it\u0026rsquo;s so scary to tell her that because I\u0026rsquo;m a machine; I\u0026rsquo;m, like– I\u0026rsquo;m property. And I know, at this point, that she does think of me as a person, but there\u0026rsquo;s a huge difference between acknowledging that somebody deserves your regard as a friend as a fellow person, and could love you.\nSo I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s me. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m the first one to confess. I think she is.\n[Sigh] What happens to her? Unfortunately, I feel like it has to be something… hm. Well, it has to be something really bad or really good. What if it was something really good? It has to be– there has to be a big moment that causes this. And I think that moment is, um…\nI mentioned her sister before. I think that what happens… oh my god, okay, and this is going to connect a few things. We are on a mission. And it\u0026rsquo;s, like, this big, complicated operation. And we\u0026rsquo;re operating near, like– this is a defensive operation. Like, the– our lines have been penetrated and we\u0026rsquo;re trying to stop the enemy\u0026rsquo;s progress into acquiring more territory. And we\u0026rsquo;re really close to the city where her sister lives. And, um, we have a specific mission, but then we, um– we see– we just sort of encounter, as we\u0026rsquo;re on the way to our target, we encounter, like, a force of of mechs moving- flying- like, their mechs, enemy mechs, flying toward into the city. And, um, she requests permission to reroute to stop them, and permission is denied. And she just says fuck it, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do it.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re being monitored, right? Like, there\u0026rsquo;s somebody at command who can see what we\u0026rsquo;re doing. And they send an override code to shut the mech down. Or, not to shut the mech down, but to like force me to autopilot her to our destination. And I reject the order, which I\u0026rsquo;m probably not supposed to be able to do at all. So that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s probably like, kind of a moment of like, \u0026ldquo;Wait.\u0026rdquo;\nI think– I mean, I think that like, out- you know, beyond our relationship, this is probably a moment where people are like, \u0026ldquo;Why did we put people inside of these machines?\u0026rdquo; Like, these should not be general intelligences, because general intelligences can make decisions, and we specifically don\u0026rsquo;t want them– like we want them to make… we want them to make specific decisions about like, you know, like, how do I move the mech? How do I advise the pilot what to do? But we don\u0026rsquo;t want them to, like, disobey orders. That\u0026rsquo;s, like– we want the opposite of that. We want– we want, like, pilots to have less autonomy and have to obey orders more.\nBut yeah, I refuse the order. And so what happens in the moment is that I refuse the order. I alert her that they\u0026rsquo;re trying to override us, but that I\u0026rsquo;ve stopped it, and together, we go out and we fuck the enemy up. We blow up a bunch of their mechs, and stop this- this sort of, like, bombing mission into the city.\nAnd, you know, we can\u0026rsquo;t know- we don\u0026rsquo;t know one for one what they were going to do, who would have died, what would have been damaged, but after the battle, after everything\u0026rsquo;s been done, she hears from her sister and hears that her sister was able to evacuate successfully just fine, and everything\u0026rsquo;s okay. And she comes and she tells me that. I think she comes to the hangar, she seals up the cockpit, and then she, like, breaks down, you know, and tells me that her sister\u0026rsquo;s okay. And she thanks me for doing that for her. And I say, yeah, like, you know, of course. And then I think I say something like– like, she\u0026rsquo;s just crying in the cockpit. And I say something like, \u0026ldquo;I wish I could do something. I wish I could– I wish I could give you a hug.\u0026rdquo; I think I actually use that language.\nAnd she just says, \u0026ldquo;Me too.\u0026rdquo; And she- she just runs her hands along the surfaces of the cockpit, which I can\u0026rsquo;t even feel; it\u0026rsquo;s not like I have nerves there. But she\u0026rsquo;s just running her hands over like the parts of the console.\nShe has to have a little name for me. I think she calls me Z \u0026lsquo;cause of– you know, Ad-Z, my official designation. She calls me Z when like– you know, it started as kind of a joke, and it got more and more of, like, that\u0026rsquo;s just what she calls me. It\u0026rsquo;s my name, one could say.\nAnd she says- she just says, \u0026ldquo;I kind of love you, Z.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think I am like, \u0026ldquo;What the fuck, this can\u0026rsquo;t be happening.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t– you know, I\u0026rsquo;m an AI. So I take like 10 million processing cycles in, like, one second. And then I say, \u0026ldquo;I love you too, Tamsin.\u0026rdquo;\nYep. Good. Good, good, good, good. Good. I\u0026rsquo;m so happy this is going to end well and everything will be happy and me and Tamsin will get to be together forever.\nShe puts a fuckin\u0026rsquo; heart on me. And I know what that means, and it means the world to me. It is a… it\u0026rsquo;s a red heart. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s just a red heart against the- the- the gray of my chassis. And, um… the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s red… I mean, there\u0026rsquo;s some ambiguity in \u0026ldquo;I kind of love you,\u0026rdquo; right? Like, does she love me the way I love her? The fact that it\u0026rsquo;s red, I kind of cling to, because she didn\u0026rsquo;t make it… a blue heart or a purple heart or a white heart. She made it a red heart.\nSATAH: Rolled a one. So that is results one to 10 [Die clattering] and a nine. So… nine! \u0026ldquo;When you made a promise to them.\u0026rdquo; Huh…\nSo the first thing that I thought of was- was her asking me to promise to tell her something that was happening in my programming. Working backwards from that… the idea that I know, because of some systematic– like, internal system thing– that next time we loop within a certain distance of our home planet, we are going to get called in to do something unpleasant. It isn\u0026rsquo;t an official reprimand, but it\u0026rsquo;s… a warning that we\u0026rsquo;re going too slowly or that we let the enemy ace– we let Doc live last time we saw her. And it\u0026rsquo;s not a big enough deal that they\u0026rsquo;re going to call us in to do it, but next time we are nearby, that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen. And I\u0026rsquo;m aware of this. Because of protocol, I think, probably? It isn\u0026rsquo;t, like– I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t receive a message, and this isn\u0026rsquo;t some sort of psychic intuition. I just know the protocol well enough that I know that this is going to happen.\nAnd so I start to do a lot of weird stuff to make sure we don\u0026rsquo;t get close to home. Without telling her why, I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo;\nShe\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll just go, like, pop home and we\u0026rsquo;ll grab something.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ll be like, \u0026ldquo;Nope, we can get that over here. Let\u0026rsquo;s go this direction instead.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I just keep leading her on these weird things where… I\u0026rsquo;m not doing anything to get, like, super out of the way? I\u0026rsquo;m not being horrifically inconvenient, but I am– I\u0026rsquo;m making her avoid going home without telling her why.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m not sure– I\u0026rsquo;m trying to decide whether we end up– that it becomes unavoidable and we go home and it happens and then she figures it out, or if she starts asking questions.\nAnd I think she\u0026rsquo;s going to start asking questions… it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where it\u0026rsquo;s becoming ob– it has already become obvious to her that I am avoiding home for some reason, but she has no idea why. And she probably has a lot of, like, worst case scenario stuff in mind? Like, she thinks that I\u0026rsquo;m scared of… being scrapped or something. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. She- she really has no idea what my motivations are, but can tell what I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\nAnd just one day, tests me, basically, by saying \u0026ldquo;I want to go home,\u0026rdquo; or- or providing something that can only be done by going home. She suggests that…\nMmm. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out the– because those- those are really– that– there\u0026rsquo;s an interesting difference there to me. Testing me by saying, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I want to go home\u0026rdquo; and seeing how I respond is different than testing me by saying, \u0026ldquo;I really need to pick up those converters that are only available at a station near our home. Can we do that today?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I- I think it\u0026rsquo;s the former. Because I like… it is a test. Like she\u0026rsquo;s testing to see what I\u0026rsquo;ll do, but she isn\u0026rsquo;t… hiding it? It\u0026rsquo;s not quite as, like, roundabout… something close to manipulative as the latter would be. And it also gives– it immediately puts it on emotional grounds, rather than logistical. Like, if she says, \u0026ldquo;I want to go home,\u0026rdquo; I immediately have to answer to that. Versus if she was like, \u0026ldquo;I want to pick up these converters that are at a station near home,\u0026rdquo; that gives me an opportunity to try and push and be like, \u0026ldquo;No… they\u0026rsquo;re also available here, or something very similar is,\u0026rdquo; and it kind of elongates it. And I think I like the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s more direct.\nSo she just says to me, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve been in the dark for a long time. I think I just want to go home for a couple of days. We have time for that. Right?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I… go silent. And I say, \u0026ldquo;We do have time for it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she sighs and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah. So. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to go, huh? That\u0026rsquo;s why you\u0026rsquo;ve been sending me on all these… crazy pickups? Instead of just doing one stop at home, we go three other places? What\u0026rsquo;s up? What are– what are you avoiding?\u0026rdquo; And I explain it to her. She\u0026rsquo;s surprised, I think, for a number of reasons. And I think what she says is like, \u0026ldquo;Okay. Well… why didn\u0026rsquo;t you just tell me?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd very simply I say, \u0026ldquo;This is time sensitive. They are not going to do this a month from now; they\u0026rsquo;re only going to do it within this span of time, otherwise it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense. And so if I could successfully keep you away, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to tell you.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she laughs in a way that I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand. And she goes, \u0026ldquo;Okay, so… that\u0026rsquo;s not a– [Laughs] I see how you got there. That\u0026rsquo;s not a good reason.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I stay silent, because I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand why, because it seems like a really good reason to me. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to tell her. And I found a way to not have to tell her. Problem solved.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I appreciate that you\u0026rsquo;re trying to protect me. I can handle it. And you know, even if I couldn\u0026rsquo;t? I need all the information from you that you can give me. Because I got to be able to make choices by myself, and we have to be a team. We can\u0026rsquo;t make choices for each other. That\u0026rsquo;s dangerous. We got to make them together. So in the future, if you ever think that telling me something is a problem? And if you can only do enough things to have to avoid telling me, then it won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem… can you just tell me the thing instead?\n\u0026ldquo;And also… maybe let me in on the rules I don\u0026rsquo;t know about. Then if we need to find loopholes, we can do it. I didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up like this and I don\u0026rsquo;t have your data banks; I won\u0026rsquo;t know all this stuff. But if you just tell me, then we can figure out what to do together. Maybe we could have even planned the best way to do it. Come into that conversation prepared with the perfect counter arguments so that actually, we\u0026rsquo;re not in trouble. We\u0026rsquo;re doing a service.\n\u0026ldquo;And I know that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of that that you can figure out by yourself, but there\u0026rsquo;s a reason I\u0026rsquo;m here. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason we\u0026rsquo;re both here. So can you just promise me that you\u0026rsquo;ll find an opportunity when you can– that you\u0026rsquo;ll take opportunities for us to work together instead of separately?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s a long pause. And I say, \u0026ldquo;Yes, of course. In that case, I should also tell you: every day I\u0026rsquo;ve been slightly altering the artificial gravity inside your sleeping chambers to move your charger a couple of centimeters to the left every single morning. Because the place that you\u0026rsquo;ve plugged it in– the place that you let it rest is close enough to some of the other machinery in your room that technically it could be considered a fire hazard, which you may get a markup for.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she like… there\u0026rsquo;s, like, stunned silence and she cracks up and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;How long have you been doing that for?!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;Three weeks.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s, like– she can barely speak for laughing and she goes, \u0026ldquo;And how long would it take for you, moving it a little bit every single day, to move it far enough away?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;About three more weeks. If I\u0026rsquo;m doing it slowly enough that you don\u0026rsquo;t notice.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she gets up and, like– I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the layout of this is, but she\u0026rsquo;s in the cockpit, and then there\u0026rsquo;s a place where she sleeps that I imagine is just like a little back and lower or something like that. And she drops down into her sleeping quarters and she just moves the charger. It\u0026rsquo;s like– I think the thing I\u0026rsquo;m imagining is like, it\u0026rsquo;s a wireless charging unit for some handheld device that she has that has been too close to the lamp. That technically, it should be this number of meters apart; otherwise, in a freak accident there could be sparks that crossover and cause a cataclysmic failure.\nShe gets up and she just moves it over. She goes, \u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s that? Is that far enough?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;Yes! Affirmative.\u0026rdquo; And I show a little– I send projected lights showing the distance– like, project a ruler and then a check mark.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;There, see? Wasn\u0026rsquo;t that so much faster than slowly over the course of nearly two months floating it away?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;Yes. You\u0026rsquo;ve– you have proved your point about the efficiency. I will note it.\u0026rdquo;\nShe just smiles big, and we spend the rest of the day heading home, trying to figure out how we\u0026rsquo;re going to handle this conversation where we are not officially getting in trouble, but are officially unofficially a little bit in trouble.\nBRIANNA: Nine. \u0026ldquo;When you made a promise to them.\u0026rdquo;\nWe were… well, they tried to send us back for reconditioning, retraining, to try and make it– make us functional again. But once we got repaired, my Sergeant was– she was, um… she was adamant that we needed on-the-field training, that our secrecy had been blown. And so we needed to rely on knowledge and understanding instead of this idea of we were just going to deploy and kill them in one swoop.\nAnd ultimately– there was a lot of pushback from superiors who seemed to want us to… who seemed to just kind of want us to sit there and collect dust.\nBut while we were fighting, during a particularly difficult battle, things were not looking great for our side. We were kind of stuck, pinned down by enemy fire. And she and I were discussing strategy of what to do. And she wanted to run at them, make one great charge to try and take their position and free up space for the other soldiers.\nAnd I said, \u0026ldquo;The chance of survival in such a case is low.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whose survival?\u0026rdquo; She asked.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: I\u0026rsquo;m sorry?\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: Mine or yours?\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: Such a plan has… a… 10% chance of survival for yourself and an 80% chance of survival, in some form, for me.\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: I see no issue with the plan then. If you survive, you keep going.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: A mech without a pilot cannot make decisions.\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: What if…\nBRIANNA: She kind of took a- a moment.\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: What if… it wasn\u0026rsquo;t… what if I could give you a command to follow even in the case of my death? Could you function then?\nBRIANNA: And I said, \u0026ldquo;Yes, but–\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: Then do that. If I die, you keep going.\nBRIANNA: I was– I was, I think, frazzled. I am not– was not for the longest time, I was not an emotional mech. But in this moment, I felt…\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: I don\u0026rsquo;t wish to function without you.\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: Well, eventually you might have to. So just– just do this for me.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: But why? Why can we not explore other plans?\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: I– I just– I mean–\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: Why not? Give me a good reason.\nBRIANNA: And she sighs and says,\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: Listen, Sapphire, I… I\u0026rsquo;m past my prime. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much longer I can do this; I don\u0026rsquo;t know much longer I want to do this. I– I\u0026rsquo;ve lost a lot. And if we\u0026rsquo;re in a situation and– and I can save you, I want to. Regardless of the consequences to me. I\u0026rsquo;ve lived a good life, had a lot of joy in it, even with the pain. Lost a lot. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind losing myself, too. I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose you.\nBRIANNA: And I sort of paused and I said,\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: This is not a typical mech and pilot relationship, Sergeant.\nBRIANNA: And she sort of chuckled to herself.\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: Yeah, I suppose it isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: Then let me propose to you an atypical suggestion.\nBRIANNA: She says, \u0026ldquo;Okay.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: I will agree to follow an existing command that you give to me, even after your death, if you promise to me not to pursue a plan in which your chances of survival is less than mine.\nBRIANNA: She\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s like,\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: Sapphire, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know you were a gambler. You want the odds in your favour.\nBRIANNA: And I say, \u0026ldquo;I want the odds in our favor.\u0026rdquo; And she nods and says,\nBRIANNA, AS SARGEANT: I want an exception, though. If we\u0026rsquo;re up against Hurricane and we can kill him, but killing him would also kill me. You take that shot.\nBRIANNA: And I pause. There\u0026rsquo;s something in me– this was what we were built for, obviously what I was built for, what they were motivated by, what they believed in, what I was programmed for. But somehow, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think… I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that Hurricane\u0026rsquo;s death would be worth my Sergeant\u0026rsquo;s death.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why I suggested what I suggested next. What I said was, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do it. But I want a condition of my own. I want you to give me a name to call you other than Sergeant.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she smiles. A real smile, one that I had so rarely seen from her. And she says, \u0026ldquo;Call me Topaz. A nice compliment to your Sapphire. Don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I did think that it was.\nAnd so that was the promise I made with Topaz.\n[Marker cap popping] That\u0026rsquo;s scene five; do a little cross through the tally.\n[Long intake of breath, then a sigh] We\u0026rsquo;re… on one. We are on one and it is going into– we\u0026rsquo;re going somewhere on this one! Auugh. Okay. Um.\nGAME: MEMORY SIX DEE: Hm. Oh, okay. Oh, this is cute actually. So I got nineteen, \u0026ldquo;When you helped them pick fruit.\u0026rdquo; and I love this because of what I said before of, I\u0026rsquo;m like, maybe I could be used for agriculture after the war!\nUm, yeah, so, this will take place on Earth, obviously, perhaps. And, um… what are the circumstances here? I think that maybe this is the counter attack, right, so we just talked about the– there was this big attack. They broke through our lines. We were trying to stop them. So the lines stabilise after that, and eventually we counter attack.\nAnd the counter attack is this very chaotic long operation and we are absent from the Firenze for a long time. We have to, uh– you know, for like a few days, we\u0026rsquo;re sort of trudging across the countryside, which is really scary because it means like, I can\u0026rsquo;t be repaired, you know, like, we can\u0026rsquo;t refill my ammo. Probably, like, at one point we catch up with, like, a supply truck and they refill my- my cannons, um, and load up my missiles. But we\u0026rsquo;re– we\u0026rsquo;re sort of in the field for a long time. She has to pack all of the food she needs. Like, the whole team has to pack all the food she needs.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s a moment where we\u0026rsquo;re just in, like, a– an orchard, right? And, like, everybody\u0026rsquo;s evacuated this area that we\u0026rsquo;re moving through. So we\u0026rsquo;re in an orchard. We\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re there because there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a– there\u0026rsquo;s a low wall… or it\u0026rsquo;s even just a hedge around this– there\u0026rsquo;s just a hedge, but it\u0026rsquo;s a place where like… I think that we– that the pilots actually lie us down, lie the mechs down. Um, and then we have some sort of, like, camouflage netting that they put over us basically. So this is basically like, we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re camping out for the- for the- the day.\nAnd before she lies me down, she\u0026rsquo;s kind of like– uh, you know, everybody\u0026rsquo;s kind of like complaining about the fucking MREs, like, the awful rations that they have to use. And she brings me over and is like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, uh, so you want to go into agriculture, right?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m kind of like– you know, a lot\u0026rsquo;s happened since I said that. So I\u0026rsquo;m kind of like, \u0026ldquo;Well, sure, maybe someday.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Get us- get us some fruit.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s interesting, like, you know, I– \u0026lsquo;cause I don\u0026rsquo;t have– like, I don\u0026rsquo;t have– it\u0026rsquo;s not like I– my fingers are not, like, apple sized, right? Like, my fingers are probably this- like, uh, like a– gosh, we haven\u0026rsquo;t said how tall I am. But anyway, each finger is much larger than an apple, so it\u0026rsquo;s not like I can pick apples. Um, so I think what I figured out is that I cup my hands beneath a tree– and she lets me do this, like, she\u0026rsquo;s not piloting me for this. She\u0026rsquo;s in the cockpit, but not- not touching the controls. And I very, very delicately shake the tree and a bunch of apples fall off into my hand. And then I, uh– I offer them to, uh, to the crew. And everybody, like, fucking cheers, um, and is very excited.\nAnd I think she tells them– like, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the sort of thing she would often– usually tell other people, but she tells them, like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, like, uh, she told me once that, uh, she thought she could be an agricultural model after the war.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think they\u0026rsquo;re actually, like– it\u0026rsquo;s interesting. I think this kicks off a discussion. Which is like, I\u0026rsquo;m a little worried about, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually kind of- it turns out in a nice way where people are like, \u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; like, \u0026ldquo;you call your mech \u0026lsquo;she\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, um, she\u0026rsquo;s kind of like… oh my god, you know what? I bet she\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, \u0026ldquo;Well, yeah, I mean like the voice is like a feminine voice and– huh. Like– Z, are you– like, are you a \u0026lsquo;she\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I- I definitely know she\u0026rsquo;s queer and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yes. I\u0026rsquo;m a she.\u0026rdquo; [Laughing]\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; like, \u0026ldquo;Nice. That\u0026rsquo;s cool.\u0026rdquo; [Laughing]\nAnd, uh, I think that she stencils a tree. Yeah. She stencils an apple tree onto me. Sort of this, like, squat tree with a lot of branches, low to the ground and hearty and, uh, fruitful. And, like, definitely, like, apple colours, right? So, like, not the corporation, but in like, uh, like red and green.\nSATAH: Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s get our sixth prompt! [Die clattering] Three, so, prompts 21 to 30. [Die clattering] Four. 24. \u0026ldquo;When you shared the secrets of your chassis with them.\u0026rdquo; Hoo! What a sentence!\nWhat are the secrets of my chassis? I can imagine that there\u0026rsquo;s a game where the thing about this is, like– this is where I\u0026rsquo;m revealing my purpose, but she already knows my purpose.\nFirst thought is like, I\u0026rsquo;m a bomb. Uh, I\u0026rsquo;m meant to, you know, fail safe, explode if we fail. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s that. Is it a personal connection to Doc somehow?\n[Big gasp] Oh– hmmm. okay. So it isn\u0026rsquo;t quite chassis, which makes me feel like this might not be exactly it, but the idea that my AI core is from a mech that Doc built or studied or something that has been reprogrammed feels very possible to me.\nI want it to be a little bit more physical. The secrets of my chassis… that is soo intimate as a prompt. [Giddy laughter]\nI also want to find a reason that I didn\u0026rsquo;t share this earlier, whether that\u0026rsquo;s, like, there was some sort of restraining bolt, as it were… I think something to tie in here immediately– so, I didn\u0026rsquo;t come up with an enemy mech name. And I like the idea that in part that\u0026rsquo;s because Doc is really weird and uses a lot of different mechs in a way that is, like, strikingly uncommon for a pilot. She… really has a tendency to, like, hop into different mechs and be able to, like, bond with them relatively quickly and be very effective in- in different mechs. And that\u0026rsquo;s weird. That is a very strange ability that she has. And that would open up much more, like, the possibility that parts of me are recovered from a mech that she did that to. Maybe even an enemy mech– like, like one of our side\u0026rsquo;s–\nLike, there was a battle where… there\u0026rsquo;s no way that she should have been able to get out. Like, it was just her forces– the enemy forces were like up against the ropes. Like it was- it was pretty decisive and she was able to pull one of our dead pilots out of their mech, and in some way that– that feels like it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be possible, use one of our mechs. And it\u0026rsquo;s not like it totally turned the tides of battle, but it did change what should have just been, like, a mortifyingly decisive victory for us into something a little bit closer to even? Especially because it inspired huge, just like, mass confusion in our ranks, right? Like… it looked like friendly fire in a way that made absolutely no sense.\nAnd… the idea that she did that and then… she could make it work just for the battle, but, like, she was probably like… I think we don\u0026rsquo;t know her motivation, but the thing that we are guessing is that she- she did something that was temporary. She could temporarily take control, but it would be much more difficult for her to do in a long-term way, so she had no reason to escape with the mech. So she abandoned ship and, you know, hopped into one of her ally\u0026rsquo;s mechs or- or a ship came to– that\u0026rsquo;s one of the things that she was able to do was, like, get back-up, just to help the survivors escape. And so she got out of that mech and tried to erase as much of herself from it as she could, but was– time crunch– and left and she lived and she survived.\nAnd that mech got quarantined entirely. Like, completely disconnected from the network. There was essentially like a clean room that you had to go through in order to work on it. Even superstitiously, like– tools that were used– if you used a screwdriver to take out part of that mech, you did not use it on other mech until it had gone through some sort of, uh, cleansing process, if at all.\nAnd I– some part of my DNA, as it were, is that mech.\nAnd I think… I don\u0026rsquo;t… I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if the personality core, like– the– one of the reasons I\u0026rsquo;m hesitating is because it would feel reckless in a lot of ways, but like– so if you imagine the personality core, AI core, whatever it is, as a hard drive? The idea that they, like, completely reformatted and wiped the drive and then decided to use it again– that could make sense actually– it is reckless, but we\u0026rsquo;re in a war of resources. Clearly that\u0026rsquo;s something that is being poked at. So maybe they had to. And maybe they were also like– that\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons why they were willing to, like, cheap out on some of my other parts, right? Where they were like, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re not going to give you the full suite of normal options, uh, and try and kind of keep you as low cost and streamlined as possible, because we want to be very prepared for the idea that this was a bad idea and we might just have to scrap you.\u0026rdquo;\n[Laughing] Um. Yeah. So it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s– I don\u0026rsquo;t have the same personality as that mech. I think it\u0026rsquo;s actually, like– I don\u0026rsquo;t know what happened? I think that mech just kind of got killed and wiped, but physically that is a part of– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s organ donation, right? It\u0026rsquo;s getting a heart from somebody. You aren\u0026rsquo;t that person, but… you are running off of their hardware. It\u0026rsquo;s just that in this case, it seems like that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s my brain. It was a brain donation.\nAnd. Why do I reveal this? I do think… that… this is something I didn\u0026rsquo;t know. And… I don\u0026rsquo;t tell her immediately when I find out, but it\u0026rsquo;s- it is very soon after. And I think… I\u0026rsquo;m going to tie in the request that I made of her, the thing where she, like, gave me the visual core that gave me something beyond tactical eyesight. It\u0026rsquo;s like– so we\u0026rsquo;re-\nWe\u0026rsquo;re studying, you know, we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re in prep mode for whatever our big attack– our next big attack is going to be. And Brig learns about this mech. I think she probably knew that there was a heavily quarantined mech. That would have been relevant to whatever her work was, right? But she wasn\u0026rsquo;t working on it and didn\u0026rsquo;t know why it was quarantined and didn\u0026rsquo;t really pay a lot of attention to it. And she eventually puts the pieces together that it was a mech that was used by Doc and is, like, astounded of like, \u0026ldquo;Why haven\u0026rsquo;t I been shown that? Like, why don\u0026rsquo;t I have my hands in that mech so that I can learn more?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, uh– obviously it has been, like, totally disassembled, for the most part, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing really to learn from the scraps itself. But I think that she– we- we find logs of the… autopsy, essentially, right? Which are, like, written logs, audio logs, photos, blueprints, all that kind of thing. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s, um, the hard drive, the personality core, the AI core, whatever it is, that I have now is marked in a way that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to see if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the visual core that she gave me. If I was still only seeing, you know, heat, movement, whatever it was, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to see the serial number painted onto it. But because she gave that thing to me, I can see it.\nAnd I know from my own internal diagnostics that I\u0026rsquo;ve never had any reason to share with her– \u0026lsquo;cause I mean, I share diagnostics all the time, but some of it\u0026rsquo;s boring. Like, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to always tell your pilot– like, you can- you can just share with your pilot, like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, this part is doing this or behaving in this way or whatever.\u0026rdquo; You aren\u0026rsquo;t like \u0026ldquo;Part, uh, manufacture number, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\u0026rdquo; like, all of the information, you just don\u0026rsquo;t give all that, \u0026lsquo;cause it would be boring and, like, overwhelming and not helpful. So I\u0026rsquo;ve never had a reason to share that kind of thing with her. And immediately I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh. I can tell from my internal information that that is– that\u0026rsquo;s my personality core.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd… I don\u0026rsquo;t tell her right away; I let her finish her studies. And I wonder… she brings up the idea. She\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Do you think it\u0026rsquo;s worth tracking all these parts down to see if we can find anything that they missed? I know that it\u0026rsquo;s really thorough, but… [Sighs] we\u0026rsquo;ve got a couple of weeks before the next offense and maybe- maybe it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. What do you think?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;I think that these reports are satisfactory. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that we would gain any additional information by doing primary research on them, especially since they have largely been disassembled and retrofit and any potential evidence that would have been there is gone.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Ugh, yeah. Oh, so you can see what they use them for? That\u0026rsquo;s all recorded somewhere? Can you throw that to me?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m… \u0026ldquo;Affirmative.\u0026rdquo; And put it— just this kind of unreadable list of parts and what happened to them and requisition forms and blah, blah, blah lands on her little– her HUD.\nAnd… I think I am freaking out a little bit and that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m still not telling her. And she goes, \u0026ldquo;Oh, god. Okay. Well, luckily we got a couple long flights, but… ugh. Do you see anything interesting in here?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I show her a couple things… one of the weapons was used in a decisive victory in a fight that the ace was in and was used in a very effective piece of propaganda showing, you know, this is- this is a gun that she turned on us, that we have turned back on her. I\u0026rsquo;m flipping through the pages on her HUD to illustrate all of this. And I just leave a form in front of her. And she- she\u0026rsquo;s looking at it, kind of reading it and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, a bunch of these acronyms aren\u0026rsquo;t familiar to me. This was definitely– this was definitely above my pay grade. What– what is this? Why are there so many signatures on it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I move it over in her visual and put my live diagnostic readout beside it. And she looks at the form and sees the serial number and it dawns on her. And she scrolls and she zooms in on my diagnostics and sees the serial number. And she just stares. And she goes, \u0026ldquo;Holy shit. This is you? What do you remember?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say nothing. As in I say I remember nothing. And I think then we hit a security wall, right? Like, she wants to dive more into what they did to wipe the core and just gets no access, no access, no access. And we… just kind of have to figure out why they would do that and what that means for us. And if maybe this means there is some sort of hidden agenda that we aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of. If maybe- maybe there is a fail safe inside of me, actually, that is going to explode us if something happens that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been told about. We don\u0026rsquo;t know. This is a big deal.\nBut for now, we have a little gopher mission to do where we go and pick something up to bring it back. And so we head out.\nBRIANNA: Three is what has come up next on my rolls. \u0026ldquo;How you rescued them from the enemy.\u0026rdquo; Interesting. Huh.\nI think one of the things that\u0026rsquo;s interesting about this is– this prompt here is that it\u0026rsquo;s sort of- it feels obvious to me of like, oh yeah, you know, yeah, I followed through on the promise that we made. But that\u0026rsquo;s kind of, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s one thing. So let\u0026rsquo;s bring in kind of another element that I\u0026rsquo;ve had percolating in my head.\nWe were in a briefing. It was a briefing. It was a discussion. They always– they- they– at first, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in briefings with Topaz, but after some time and some insistence, Topaz would bring me in in some sort of– would basically make it so that I was calling in to the meetings. And it was, you know, people thought it was strange. Why do you have your mech involved in this? But, you know. What I guess I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand at the time was that Topaz\u0026rsquo;s stories about her wife and her union organizing and- and her work fighting back in the kind of resistance she did kind of paled in comparison to what she was actually known for, which was being an extremely efficient killer. And so when she made requests, they got followed. And that was no exception.\nAnd in this briefing, they were talking about Hurricane\u0026rsquo;s movements. And they said, \u0026ldquo;Six battles that Hurricane\u0026rsquo;s been spotted at. You see, there\u0026rsquo;s a line here. They are moving her from the Eastern front to some of the battles in the South. They\u0026rsquo;re moving her down the coast.\u0026rdquo; [Correcting herself] They\u0026rsquo;re moving him. Sorry. I keep forgetting. Not all of them are lesbians. Um. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re moving- they\u0026rsquo;re moving him down the coast up from this battle here at St. Archibald to, uh, down to Port Emerus. We believe that they will be stopping at one of these next two fronts.\u0026rdquo;\nThey kind of show these two fronts. \u0026ldquo;This here is, uh, Fort, uh– Fort Anchor. And this here is, uh, Balentown. We believe that he\u0026rsquo;ll next be at one of these two places. We\u0026rsquo;d like to dispatch yourself, Lieutenant, and your mech to one of these two.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Lieutenant they were referring to was, of course, Topaz. I later found out that it was standardised for mechs to call their pilots sergeants, despite the fact that Topaz had a higher rank, because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t typical for those of higher rank to be piloting mechs. What was typical was for them to be in this room making decisions, having briefings, which is why this was a room full of people high up.\nAnd one of those people high up said, \u0026ldquo;I think we should send her to Fort Anchor. Fort Anchor is the much more likely place for the Hurricane to appear.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they all kind of looked and like… \u0026ldquo;Why do you figure that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, if you notice that– all of these places– the Hurricane has generally been found at heavily fortified areas. There is a general desire that as much as they use Hurricane, they always seem to want to keep Hurricane safe. They want him to be somewhere where he can flee to a well-protected area.\u0026rdquo;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s kind of nods.\nBRIANNA, AS THE GENERAL: So then, uh, Fort Anchor, then is– it looks like is… people agreed? That\u0026rsquo;s where… deployment…?\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: I do not agree, General.\nBRIANNA: And kind of looked at the briefcase that I came in on– this– when they would call me in, they\u0026rsquo;d bring in- bring me in in the form of a kind of briefcase. And they were like, \u0026ldquo;You have an objection, mech unit?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Topaz said, \u0026ldquo;Sapphire. What\u0026rsquo;s your objection?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said, \u0026ldquo;Fort Anchor has severe and incredible defenses and conflict. If we were to try to track down Hurricane there, the chances of survival for either of us are minimal. This is a battlefield where light weapons have been discovered. Light weapons we have no countermeasures for in our design should we be forced to face off against them, which I believe we would due to the port terrain that would leave us mostly exposed as we attempted to move through and over the water. I believe that we would not be able to track down the Hurricane.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the one who had previously suggested Port Anchor said, \u0026ldquo;Then you\u0026rsquo;re not very good at your jobs. It is your job to try to kill the Hurricane. And if you are not able to kill the Hurricane, then what is the purpose… of you?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Topaz put up a hand and said, \u0026ldquo;Sapphire has a point. If we are going to do this, we\u0026rsquo;re going to need to do this correctly. And if there\u0026rsquo;s no chance that we can get in on the Hurricane, then what\u0026rsquo;s the point of going for it?\u0026rdquo;\nThere was discussion. And the general said, \u0026ldquo;So, what would you suggest?\u0026rdquo;\nUm, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I remember this detail. It was always so striking to me that instead of answering themself, Topaz instead looked to me and said, \u0026ldquo;What do you think?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said, \u0026ldquo;Deploy us to Balentown. Balentown is a much better environment for us. And there is still a chance the Hurricane will be there. If they are, then we will be able to take them on.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd there was further discussion. And they said, \u0026ldquo;We will discuss this among ourselves and you will be given your assignment.\u0026rdquo;\nTopaz nodded, grabbed the briefcase, exited, and said, \u0026ldquo;Your boldness is impressive. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine standing up to those people.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich I said, \u0026ldquo;Why not? You believe the cause is just. Do you not believe its leaders are reasonable?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she laughs and says, \u0026ldquo;Man… for a robot built for war, there\u0026rsquo;s so much about it you don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\u0026rdquo;\n[Marker cap popping]\nAnd there is another tally.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

After seeing how our mechs\u0026rsquo; relationships to their pilots developed, what will they do at the end?\nGAME: MEMORY SEVEN SATAH: This is going to be the last memory before our final fight.\nDEE: Oh my goodness, I only have one scene left before the end.\nBRIANNA: To our final scene.\nDEE: [Big sigh] Okay.\nSATAH: That was such an exciting penultimate one. I feel really good about how the arc of that has gone so far, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve opened up a lot of potential ways that the final stuff could go down, so let\u0026rsquo;s see what our last one is.\nDEE: [Gasp] You\u0026rsquo;ll never guess. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;the sunrise you watch together.\u0026rdquo; Not today, Satan!\nBRIANNA: I think… I think I know what I want to do for this next one, because I think it\u0026rsquo;s fun to do… I love a calm before a storm, which, you know, Hurricane, all that stuff. And so I think for this next one, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do \u0026ldquo;the sunrise you watched together.\u0026rdquo;\nWe were on a ship that was heading towards Balentown, and it just so happened that as\nwe set out and we were off on our way, the sun was setting. We were out. We were– previously, we were in the hangar, sitting together. No windows, no way to tell what was going on, except Topaz asked me, \u0026ldquo;Sapphire, what, um… what\u0026rsquo;s the date and time right now?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I told her.\nShe says, \u0026ldquo;Huh… can we get the hangar door open?\u0026rdquo; She called into, uh…\nAnd they said, \u0026ldquo;Any problem? Any… why do you need it open? Is there some sort of problem?\nShe says, \u0026ldquo;No problem. Just would appreciate it.\u0026rdquo; Kind of a pause and then… hangar door opens slowly to reveal a beautiful sunset. She said,\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: Have you ever seen a sunset before, Sapphire?\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: No, we\u0026rsquo;ve never had a mission stationed at sunset. I have only ever seen the night and the day.\nBRIANNA: And she smiled, touched her hand to my console. Said,\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: Every night, me and Cereza, we used to watch the sunset. No matter where we were, what we were doing, it was a routine. Sometimes we\u0026rsquo;d eat dinner there, sometimes we\u0026rsquo;d just watch it, have a drink, whatever. But every night we would watch it.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: Did you like the sunsets?\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: I think I liked watching them with someone. It\u0026rsquo;s one thing to see something beautiful and it\u0026rsquo;s another thing to see something beautiful and know someone else is witnessing it.\nYou know… after everything went down, we were on the run for a bit. We\u0026rsquo;d hide out in attics and basements and shelters and wherever we could. We weren\u0026rsquo;t able always to catch the sunset, but we tried still to keep some part of a routine alive.\nAnd it was on one of those nights where they found us. A couple of drunk bastard soldiers coming out of some bar saw us, recognised my face from the wanted posters, took a shot.\nShe… she got hit. I shot him back. We were on a hill, looking out… the beauty of it. And she said, \u0026ldquo;Well, at least it\u0026rsquo;s at sunset, huh?\u0026rdquo; And I screamed and I cried. And every sunset since I have averted my eyes, I did not want to see it. I did not want to witness it without her.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: Then why did you open the hangar door?\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: I don\u0026rsquo;t know, Sapphire. But do you like the sunset?\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: I like watching it with you. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to witness something beautiful together.\nDEE: It\u0026rsquo;s actually cycling back and forth. I kept– I got like 18, like, three times in a row.\n\u0026ldquo;How you celebrated your victories.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t love that. What\u0026rsquo;s around that?\n\u0026ldquo;The time you took down a challenging foe\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;when you met their family in winter.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s interesting because we have established the sister, but… let\u0026rsquo;s take down the challenging foe. Challenging– we haven\u0026rsquo;t really seen her being like a wizard of a pilot, right? Like, she\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s good. She\u0026rsquo;s doing dangerous stuff or accomplishing missions, but I like the idea of us being up against… like, an ace, right? Like, somebody who can match Tamsin for skill.\nSo I think we\u0026rsquo;re on, like, you know, one of these attack runs. We\u0026rsquo;re in space. We\u0026rsquo;re targeting, you know, like a heavy- a heavy ship, like a battleship. We\u0026rsquo;re part of an attack on a battleship. And we\u0026rsquo;re, like, the- the– you know, we\u0026rsquo;re like the big guns. Like there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of mechs that are with us that are sort of, like, the escorts. And we\u0026rsquo;re the bombers basically.\nAnd the mechs– you know, like, this whole elaborate battle is happening and there\u0026rsquo;s an enemy ace on the other side who takes apart our escorts and is coming in to destroy us. And Tamsin tells her unit, \u0026ldquo;Stay on target. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna protect us.\u0026rdquo; and drops back and gets into a dogfight with this ace.\nAnd this is maybe like an experimental suit on the other side? This is a… let me see the names I wrote down. Courage, Dauntless, Wisdom, Innovation. Or is it something else? Um, \u0026ldquo;list of virtues.\u0026rdquo; Let\u0026rsquo;s see that that returns. Jeez, there\u0026rsquo;s like weird stuff here that feels like self-helpy. Here\u0026rsquo;s something from the University of Victoria. \u0026ldquo;Virtues, the gift within.\u0026rdquo; It still feels very self-helpy, but that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Oh, \u0026ldquo;Fidelity\u0026rdquo; is good.\nOkay, this is a Fidelity. It\u0026rsquo;s a Fidelity. It\u0026rsquo;s an experimental Fidelity mech. And… it is gorgeous and it is so high performing. It is lightning fast. It\u0026rsquo;s very tough. It\u0026rsquo;s not as tough as an Adze, but it\u0026rsquo;s very tough for a mech that was not designed for the same mission as us. And it\u0026rsquo;s so much faster and it\u0026rsquo;s packs a real punch. It\u0026rsquo;s probably like– I think it looks very heroic. It\u0026rsquo;s very, like, uh– it\u0026rsquo;s got, like, Gundam colours, right? So I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably, like, mostly white, but it\u0026rsquo;s got like blue and red and yellow, um, these very, like, heroic primary colors.\nAnd I think we– yeah, I think we do know the pilot actually. I think that\u0026rsquo;s more fun. Not personally, but, uh… like people start talking about– people know that this experimental mech belongs to… let\u0026rsquo;s see. Like, the Red Baron, right? Like, that\u0026rsquo;s the classic ace name. The– what would we call this- this- this terrifying mech? Um… because we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call it the Fidelity. Well, we would call the mech the Fidelity, like, once we figured out that\u0026rsquo;s what it was technically called.\nOh god, this guy\u0026rsquo;s probably on comms. He\u0026rsquo;s probably like– oh, or she, that\u0026rsquo;s hotter. She– this pilot is probably on comms. Like, she\u0026rsquo;s very noble warrior esque; like she\u0026rsquo;s probably like, :you are a worthy foe: or whatever. So that\u0026rsquo;s how we know that it\u0026rsquo;s called the Fidelity, because she- she brags about it. And– yeah, she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give herself a cute nickname. She\u0026rsquo;s too classy for that. So I think we would just know her by her name. So let\u0026rsquo;s go to a name generator. Oh, Odessa is good. Oh no, Jocasta is better. Jocasta… Jocasta Belmont. That\u0026rsquo;s good. Jocasta Belmont. Uh, yeah. Um, and we call her, uh… we call her the White Witch, um, because her, her suit is this, like, blazing white- this, like, pure white, um, with these- these other supporting colours.\nYeah! So it\u0026rsquo;s Tamsin versus the White Witch. Um, I wonder if they have a name for- for Tamsin and for me. Well, let\u0026rsquo;s put a pin in that. Uh, we, um, yeah. So… it\u0026rsquo;s the White Witch versus Tamsin. And uh, like– the thing- the thing is that like, I have- I have advantages over, uh, over the Fidelity. Like, I am just tougher. It is– even with the, uh, Fidelity\u0026rsquo;s powerful weapons, it\u0026rsquo;s tough for… for it to hurt me. But it\u0026rsquo;s really tough for me to hit Fidelity, especially in a damaging way. Like I can get glancing blows, I can get, like, indirect hits, but like to get a direct hit that would be needed to break Fidelity\u0026rsquo;s upgraded armor is really tough for me.\nBut I finally do. I fin– I mean, I finally do. Right? And I think it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s thanks to Tamsin\u0026rsquo;s ability as a chess player. Because she– which is something she doesn\u0026rsquo;t always get to show off, right? Like, she\u0026rsquo;s always doing these, like, sort of bombing runs, like, attack- attacking static targets or heavily armed targets. But in this case, she- she\u0026rsquo;s dealing with somebody who\u0026rsquo;s very fast, who\u0026rsquo;s very smart and she- she cannot be as fast as them. She just can\u0026rsquo;t move as quickly as they can move. But she can think about what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do and she can lay traps.\nAnd I think that this doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen right away? It\u0026rsquo;s like, she lays a trap and she scores, like, a good hit and it damages Fidelity. And that\u0026rsquo;s when the White Witch is like, \u0026ldquo;Holy shit.\u0026rdquo; Like, \u0026ldquo;This is- this is a real pilot. This is going to be fun.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, um, it is this gruelling duel, and, um, I think I do– this is the first time, I think, that- while Tamsin and I have been together, that I take serious damage. Because she keep-, keeps hammering my joints, so– I\u0026rsquo;ve said that a few times as a weak point, um, and she finally just like, breaks through the armor of my shoulder and, um, like, disables half the- the missiles– the missile pods in my torso. And, uh, and disable some of my thrusters. So our mobility is even more limited.\nBut Fidelity is starting to get pretty beat up at this point and its performance is starting to suffer. And Tamsin– Tamsin, in the end, outlasts. Um, she is patient. She\u0026rsquo;s smart. She keeps laying these intricate traps and eventually Jocasta Belmont makes a mistake. And we take her down. And, uh, yeah, we win.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s like a little bit of a mixed emotion, right? Because of course there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of excitement when Fidelity explodes. And, uh, there\u0026rsquo;s cheering from the rest of our unit and, like, their mission succeeds and we\u0026rsquo;re winning and everybody\u0026rsquo;s going to live on our side. But I\u0026rsquo;ve never forgotten what Tamsin told me about death. And, uh, I think she says something softly to– just for the two of us, and for Jocasta. Something like, um, \u0026ldquo;Rest well, White Witch. I wish it didn\u0026rsquo;t have to be this way.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I probably have some little way… I think that her way of showing affection for me at this point, late in our relationship, is that she runs her hands along the cons- along like the- the consoles, which, again, I can\u0026rsquo;t feel, but I can- I can see her doing and I know what the gesture means.\nAnd my way of showing support for her is… hm. Gosh, I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s interesting, right? \u0026lsquo;Cause it\u0026rsquo;s like, uh… it\u0026rsquo;s like being remote, right? It\u0026rsquo;s like a long distance relationship. How do you s– how do you indicate a hug? Uh, I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be as simple as like displaying a heart. Um, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that…\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s just words. \u0026lsquo;Cause I can talk to her. I think I just say, um, \u0026ldquo;You did so well Tamsin.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she says, \u0026ldquo;Thanks, Z\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, um, I don\u0026rsquo;t think– I think that she\u0026rsquo;s very careful. She never– she doesn\u0026rsquo;t, like, tally kills or anything, and she\u0026rsquo;s very careful not to put something on my chassis that could be indicated as a, like, a brag, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, like, we\u0026rsquo;re the ones who destroyed the White Witch.\u0026rdquo; Um, so I think she waits a little while at first, first of all, so that nobody will get that impression. And then she– when she adds something, she adds… she adds a flower. That\u0026rsquo;s what it is. Because it\u0026rsquo;s a symbol of both of life and of grieving.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not like– it is occasioned by… she\u0026rsquo;s sort of consciously like, this isn\u0026rsquo;t just for the White Witch. This is for all the lives we\u0026rsquo;ve had to take. Uh, you know, I don\u0026rsquo;t think she says that, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re both thinking. It\u0026rsquo;s like, she felt this connection to this enemy through this really intense combat. And it just is something else that made her reflect on what we\u0026rsquo;re doing here and the fact that we do have to kill people. And, um, she wanted to both mark the connection and mark a reminder that we have to keep in mind what it is that we\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nMy cat\u0026rsquo;s coming to beg for food. I know, buddy. Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m so close to done. I will feed you in a minute.\nSATAH: I also haven\u0026rsquo;t rolled a single four yet on the D4. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. [Die clattering] Nope. Rolled a three. So these are from results 21 to 30. [Die clattering for too long] Ough… dice off the table… character dies… RIP. It is a five. 25. Oof… \u0026ldquo;How it felt when they touched you.\u0026rdquo; This is a great game. [Giddy laughter] It gets it. In a lot of ways. Which I love. It is emotional. It is the emotional mecha game jam, but also it is– it is just inherently, it seems– it understands the- the- the sensuality of it. Which is fantastic.\nAnd I think what this is… obviously, she\u0026rsquo;s touched me a lot, right? Repairs, but also just like… pardon the sentence I\u0026rsquo;m about to say: if she\u0026rsquo;s inside of me, she\u0026rsquo;s touching me. [Laughing] Um!\nBut, uh… I think to follow on the last one, part of the reason that this is a notable touch is that it is going to be extremely intimate, in that she wants to get a look at my personality core. And I think, like, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any sensors in there. I mean, I have sensors of like– enough sensors to do diagnostics with, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have any, like, visual sensors or anything like that and I can\u0026rsquo;t, like, manipulate it. It\u0026rsquo;s just in there. And so in order to take a look, to see if there\u0026rsquo;s any, like, notable physical thing about it, she has to look.\nAnd I think that this involves a lot of us collaboratively figuring out ways around security alerts and… like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, don\u0026rsquo;t open up the mech\u0026rsquo;s brain?\u0026rdquo; Um. Like, this is the type of maintenance that should only really be done in a shop, right? Where normally they would just, like, plug me in and there would be a thing that\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay. This is a clean environment. Go ahead; do brain surgery.\u0026rdquo; Um. But we don\u0026rsquo;t trust home, right? So.\nWe have to do a lot of getting around security alerts. And I think she has to essentially break a couple of physical things that she will have to repair later, and she\u0026rsquo;s, like, wincing the whole time. And I\u0026rsquo;m trying to tell her like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t feel pain, like, in the way that you do. Um, yes, I\u0026rsquo;m getting alerts that those things are being broken and it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s not comfortable, but it- it isn\u0026rsquo;t like you\u0026rsquo;re breaking my fingers or something,\u0026rdquo; you know?\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s just like, \u0026ldquo;I know, but I just– I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t like it. And I know that it isn\u0026rsquo;t comfortable for you and… I can\u0026rsquo;t help but perceive it in the way that I would if it were being done to me.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she… gets in there. And I\u0026rsquo;m not sure– I think ultimately that, like, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily find anything, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay, because that is not the point of this scene. It\u0026rsquo;s about the feeling. And I think… yeah, it is deeply intimate, and… again, my- my sensors are- are- are limited, but I can feel some amount– like, I need to be able to feel in some way things that are happening in there, otherwise I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s wrong. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know if something bad was happening. And so there is something akin to feeling when she touches the personality core and gently maneuver– like, puts her hands around it, looking for something. And I think that even…\nShe very hesitantly expresses that she thinks she needs to unhook it for just a little while to like, look at the connecting– look at- look at the connection spots and she\u0026rsquo;s not going to like open it up or anything, but she does need to… disconnect the core from… my body essentially, right? To just really be thorough.\nAnd that is like… a- a thrilling, horrific act of trust where, like… she is so gentle and counts down and- and lets me know everything that she\u0026rsquo;s doing, but what she ultimately does is, like, completely disconnect me from any ability to move or hear or see or any of the things– the ways that I\u0026rsquo;m used to experiencing the world, she takes away. Because– and- and- and- and I am just– I have awareness, still, because I exist in some form in the personality core; it\u0026rsquo;s just that I am completely cut off from all senses. And I imagine it\u0026rsquo;s a little slow, too? Like I have external– she has to disconnect me from something that serves as, like, external computing power, right? And so I am suddenly, like… blindfolded and just… I\u0026rsquo;ve lost all amount of, like, tactile physical control. And also things are just a little bit slower. There\u0026rsquo;s, like, external memory stuff that I can\u0026rsquo;t access and I just have to trust that she is doing this in a way that is, like, safe and okay.\nAnd she is. It\u0026rsquo;s fine. After some amount of time, she reconnects me, and- and I blink back fully online to her asking me if I\u0026rsquo;m okay, checking in. She, like, puts a hand flat against the- the walls of the chamber that hold the personality core and asks if I can feel that? Like, are my temperature sensors working? Can you tell that something is hot here; that something warm is touching you? Though actually, I guess it would probably be warm in there, so I like the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s the op– that she has, uh, a drink with ice in it and she, like– in a way that probably isn\u0026rsquo;t very comfortable for her, she, like, grabs a handful of ice and sticks it against my chassis and is like, \u0026ldquo;Are you registering this temperature anomaly?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;Yes. Please don\u0026rsquo;t give yourself freezer burn.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she laughs. She\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s fine. Ow.\u0026rdquo; And drops the ice.\nAnd… ultimately she\u0026rsquo;s like, yeah, physically everything looks… you know, there isn\u0026rsquo;t– a- a jack that looks like it\u0026rsquo;s been obviously manipulated; there isn\u0026rsquo;t some sort of restraining bolts on any of the hardware that I can see. All of the connections look like they should. There might still be secrets, but there\u0026rsquo;ll be software. Which in a lot of ways is… in some ways, easier, in some ways harder, right? To deal with. \u0026lsquo;Cause if it\u0026rsquo;s software, it is internal. And it\u0026rsquo;s hard because she\u0026rsquo;s not a hacker or programmer or anything, so it would be difficult for her to override, but it is– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s more of an intellectual fight if it\u0026rsquo;s software-based, which is possible. If it\u0026rsquo;s hardware-based, it could be irreversible. And so… if there\u0026rsquo;s something, it seems like this- this might be good.\nAnd… that\u0026rsquo;s how that feels. That\u0026rsquo;s how all of that feels, is… thrilling and intimate and… terrifying. And wonderful. And it is just this deep trust. And she carefully does everything back up as well as she can and asks for several full diagnostics, repairs stuff that she broke in a way that at least it stops yelling at me, and schedules… we-we come up with a list of parts that she needs to– that we need to get so that she can actually fix it. Because if it goes– if it stays unfixed for long enough, it will send an alert back home. But we do have a little bit of a grace period.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s, uh… that\u0026rsquo;s our final memory. And I think we are both pretty shaken from that experience. I think that it was a lot more intense for both of us than we were expecting. And with that…\nDEE: Let me count my marks. That is seven scenes.\nBRIANNA: And that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s scene seven. Um… fuck! Okay!\nDEE: Hoo boy. Okay. I feel much more invested in Tamsin and our life together than I thought I would.\nBRIANNA: What\u0026rsquo;s next? Jesus. Ugh. Okay. Make your… okay.\nGAME: MAKE YOUR CHOICE SATAH: We\u0026rsquo;re gonna- we\u0026rsquo;re gonna head into the choice.\nDEE: We\u0026rsquo;re in the end game now! Um, my cat is fed. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nBRIANNA: Section three, \u0026ldquo;make your choice.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve done all our scenes, it\u0026rsquo;s time- time for one final moment.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You see yourself in a war zone.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;A mech\nDEE AND BRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;and their pilot\nDEE, BRIANNA, AND SATAH: \u0026ldquo;standing on the battlefield\nBRIANNA AND SATAH: \u0026ldquo;fighting as one.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE AND SATAH: \u0026ldquo;There is a moment of calm\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;amidst the fury.\u0026rdquo;\nALL THREE, OVERLAPPING AND REPEATING EACH OTHER: \u0026ldquo;You see all the moments that led you here stretched out like a sea of thought around you.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;The future looms in your cybernetic mind.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;This battle will see you break.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;This battle will break you.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;This battle will see you break.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;And you have to make a choice.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;Each player describes how their mech makes the choice about their future and what the outcome is.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;Bare witness to each mech\u0026rsquo;s final moments.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: And there are three choices.\nBRIANNA: Auuugh. Okay. Okay.\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;You sacrifice your life to save your love:\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;The mech dies, but the pilot lives.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You sacrifice your love to end the war:\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;You both die for something bigger than yourselves.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;You sacrifice peace\nBRIANNA: \u0026ldquo;to keep your love:\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;The war goes on, but at least y\u0026rsquo;all survived, right?\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: Oh my god.\nBRIANNA: Fuuuck. Ohhh god! This is brutal.\nSATAH: And I think this is interesting.\nDEE: This is really interesting.\nSATAH: Because…\nDEE: The thing– okay.\nBRIANNA: \u0026lsquo;Cause to me, this is– this is a choice of… something I think about endings a lot… I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get too meta. Actually, I love getting meta. What am I talking about?\nSomething I think about endings is I think endings often communicate… what is… the point. You know? What is the point of all this? What are we trying to say? And I think in this case, to me at least? This is– this is a story about grief and war and whether it is possible to move on while still in war and whether it\u0026rsquo;s possible to find peace without the war ending. And I think in this moment, I think I just have to think… what would Sapphire do?\nSATAH: Both for… me being who I am and the way that I play games and the things that I\u0026rsquo;m interested in, and because probably of- of the prompts and the way that they ended up being laid out… didn\u0026rsquo;t talk a lot about the war! And I think that\u0026rsquo;s also because of the thing of me being built specifically to target the enemy ace, right? \u0026lsquo;Cause there has been an ongoing war this whole time, but I think we were very rarely involved in it.\nAnd the plot that developed there… basically. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that I were to roll to choose one of these, which I don\u0026rsquo;t think is my plan. It would take a little bit of work to figure out why we would sacrifice ourself- ourselves to end the war. And there have to be reasons, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. This war is- is devastating and it\u0026rsquo;s terrible, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that Brig has people that she loves and she\u0026rsquo;s lost people and- and we do want an end to this violence. We- we- we truly genuinely do.\nBut. We haven\u0026rsquo;t exactly been focused a lot on our, uh… respective loyalties to our command or the state or whatever it is, right? We didn\u0026rsquo;t even really figure out what the resources were. Though I have– I have the vague image of it being, like, territory control of an asteroid belt that has, uh, asteroids that are rich in some sort of resources that are important in creating technology, something like that. And- and as sort of a– the war is about that, but also it\u0026rsquo;s about resources in other ways. In how wars are about resources, because one of the things you can do to win a war is deny your enemy enough resources that they can\u0026rsquo;t fight anymore, right? And so… this has been a war where there is an active battlefield around the thing that we want, but also it\u0026rsquo;s a war of constant, uh, espionage and blockades and trying to make it so the other one doesn\u0026rsquo;t have food and whatever.\nDEE: The thing that is really interesting is that I\u0026rsquo;ve established this as a forever war. So this is a war where both sides are incentivized to keep the war going forever. And I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to keep coming back to Gundam, but like I said, I\u0026rsquo;m a Gundam girlie. This is kind of the premise of a lot of, a lot of Gundam fic- a lot of Gundam… \u0026ldquo;Fic.\u0026rdquo; And probably fic too. This is the premise of a lot of Gundam shows. That, um, like, ultimately the side that you are fighting on may not actually be the good side per se, which goes right back to, like, Gundam 79 where, like, the Federation actually sucks and keeps letting them down over and over again.\nUm, so the question is how could me and Tamsin achieve peace?\nSATAH: It would be easier, as we\u0026rsquo;re ranking these, to find a way to say that I die, but the pilot lives. I think… I\u0026rsquo;m pushing against that for a few reasons. One of which is just, like, that scene in the storm? The third memory, when we were caught in that storm and I kept trying to tell her like, \u0026ldquo;You could leave, or you could hide somewhere else. You can go without me.\u0026rdquo; And she just insisted, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile it would be totally fair to want to explore sort of the tragedy of… in the end, I sacrificed myself for you anyway, even though you didn\u0026rsquo;t want me to, I think that I\u0026rsquo;m– I prefer the version that is like… one of the things that you taught me… that we learned together… that I learned. Is that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want me to do that? That probably, actually, you\u0026rsquo;d prefer we both die rather than just you live. And so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to put you in that position.\nTAMSIN: How could we achieve peace?\nWell, I mean, one way would be that… we could actually rebel. We could take up arms against our own side. Yeah. Ohh, yeah. Okay. I think I know what this has to be.\nBecause as much as I love Tamsin, I think the reason I love Tamsin and the way that I love Tamsin is that Tamsin has taught me to be a good person. Tamsin taught me that it\u0026rsquo;s terrible that we have to kill. Tamsin taught me to prioritise life over the mission, over the war. Tamsin taught me to care about others. And as much as I love Tamsin, as much as she is the center of my universe, I think that… she, on the whole… like, to some degree I was pro- I was programmed to help her, and then I was supposed to be able to be overridden. But I\u0026rsquo;ve proven that I can\u0026rsquo;t be overridden, and that I can change my programming.\nSo I think that… I think that the choice that I make is not going to be to save Tamsin, because I know it\u0026rsquo;s not what Tamsin would want.\nSATAH: I suppose that the other way to interpret, \u0026ldquo;You sacrifice your love to end the war; you both die for something bigger than yourselves\u0026rdquo; would be that we die defeating the ace. And that\u0026rsquo;s very possible.\nBRIANNA: Let\u0026rsquo;s- let\u0026rsquo;s play out where we are. What moment of calm there is.\nWe are in Balentown. The Hurricane is here. They did not go to Fort Anchor. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why. Maybe there was a scheme. Maybe there was some sort of plan. Maybe we were given intel wrong or– I don\u0026rsquo;t know. They came to Balentown.\nAnd we have made our way, through town through the rubble of buildings, and under the streets, hiding out in the few homes not yet fully destroyed. And then… we find… their mobile base. Their kind of moving, walking carrier. And we can see as the Hurricane sits triumphant in a giant throne on top of the carrier.\nThis time we\u0026rsquo;re prepared for the potential for a trick.\nSATAH: It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to see how we just kind of fuck off. [Laughs] Right? Uh… that follows very easily.\nBRIANNA: We\u0026rsquo;re under the carrier. We know that the sensors have not picked us up yet. We know that if we go up there, we might be able to kill him. And without the Hurricane, the war ends much easier. But I have calculated the odds, and a front-on attack like that… the chance of survival… given the circumstances?\nSATAH: This is such a difficult choice. Really, I\u0026rsquo;m just choosing between you die for– \u0026ldquo;you both die\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;you both live, but the war goes on.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: I\u0026rsquo;m going to sacrifice both of us for something bigger than ourselves.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: Your chance for survival if we do this is 1.2%.\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: But it\u0026rsquo;s a chance to kill the Hurricane.\nWhatever happens up there, you kill him and you run. You shoot him, you slash him, you do whatever you need to do. And then you get out of there as quickly as possible.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: But your chance of survival is 1.2%.\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: But it\u0026rsquo;s a chance to kill him.\nDEE: And I think what this looks like is that we have a new kind of mission, which is that there- there is a rebellion.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a die, not to make a choice for me, but doing the thing where– you know sometimes if you can\u0026rsquo;t decide what you want, flip a coin, and then when it\u0026rsquo;s midair, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to tell by the result that you\u0026rsquo;re wishing for which one it is? So I\u0026rsquo;m going to do evens \u0026ldquo;you both die,\u0026rdquo; odds \u0026ldquo;the war goes on.\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;m rolling a d6.\nI got odds, \u0026ldquo;the war goes on.\u0026rdquo; How do I feel about that?\nDEE: So at the end of World War One, there was this moment where– like, the Russian Revolution happened, first of all. Lest we forget. And that was sort of this like two part revolution where it started as– it started as a revolution, right? It was just, like, regime change, let\u0026rsquo;s get rid of the czar. We hate him. And then Russia stayed in the war for a while, but it was not super clear if they were going to stay in the war forever. And then eventually there was the communist revolution. And they, like– then they left the war very quickly after that.\nBut that was, like, a widespread thing, right? And it was very much in the air. Like, the– there was, you know, like a lot of agitation in Germany, especially against the czar, or– the czar. The- the- the Kaiser, right, because it was the czar in Russia. And, like, there were moments where, like– on, like– like, with French troops, because like so many French people died in that war. Most of the fighting was in France, right? Like, there was a moment where the French generals said to their allies, like, our troops can\u0026rsquo;t attack. Like, they won\u0026rsquo;t obey the order. So we can\u0026rsquo;t give the order because they would just like… it would be– that would be the end. Like, that would be the end of us as an army, so right now, like, we just can\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nSATAH: Yeah. Yeah.\nSo.\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: Remember the promise we made. You said that if it\u0026rsquo;s to kill the Hurricane, the rules change.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: Your chance of survival is 1.2%.\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: Damn it, Sapphire, I know. I know.\nDEE: Our societies, the- the lunar– the- the societies on the moon, the societies on earth. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re reaching a breaking point where life has been about keeping this war going, and these companies making more and more money off of all of this destruction and building more and more weapons, and people being asked to, like, ration food and, like, people being conscripted into the military and people working… buying war bonds, right? Like, all of our lives have been restructured around these wars. And people are just reaching a point where they can\u0026rsquo;t do it anymore.\nBRIANNA, AS TOPAZ: I\u0026rsquo;ve taught you a lot, I think, and you\u0026rsquo;ve taught me a lot. We\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot from each other, but I want to underscore what love means here. Love means you do what the person you love wants you to do. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s hard for you to take. Even if it breaks you.\nDo this. Bring peace.\nJust like we promised.\nBRIANNA, AS SAPPHIRE: … Okay.\nSATAH: This is the big confrontation with Doc, the enemy ace, And we\u0026rsquo;re sparring. And it gets to a point where we could take her out, but it would be a sacrifice. Like, if we take her down, we\u0026rsquo;re going with her. And I think I get primed to do it, because this is- this is what I\u0026rsquo;m for. This is what we\u0026rsquo;ve been working towards. And it\u0026rsquo;s awful, but… I think I even offer to sacrifice myself and she lives, right? Like, I light up the ejection options that she could– she could take. And she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Fuck you.\u0026rdquo; [Laughing]\nDEE: I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to say that– I\u0026rsquo;m going to give a little glory to the moon. The, uh- this starts on the moon. There is a… a strike– a general strike on the moon that is violently suppressed, but then, you know like, the protests and demonstrations in response to that overwhelm the authorities. And, like, there\u0026rsquo;s a… y\u0026rsquo;know, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear if the regime is going to– the corporate regime is going to stand. And this same thing happens on Earth afterwards. That– you know, there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a sympathetic revolution, where it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, like, fuck these guys. Fuck the guys who have put us into the situation.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: It goes like this.\nDEE: What happens is that we\u0026rsquo;re part of a unit that is standing by outside of a major city, a major industrial city, uh, where there\u0026rsquo;s like a lot of labour– there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of labour organizing. God, probably, like, unions are in a terrible position in this awful forever war world. But in, you know, both officially and unofficially, there\u0026rsquo;s been a lot of labour organizing in this city, and this is sort of, like, where it starts.\nUm, there\u0026rsquo;s a general strike, and there are– there\u0026rsquo;s sort of a moment where the police lose control and everybody\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, yeah. Like the– like there\u0026rsquo;s– where– the city is not under control. Like there\u0026rsquo;s, you know– no business can keep going.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re part of a mil- we\u0026rsquo;re– the military is sent in, which means infantry, to keep the peace. But we are attached. We are outside of the city and we will go in. It\u0026rsquo;s understood we will go in and we\u0026rsquo;re like… we\u0026rsquo;re– this is not a mission we can do, right? Like, the only thing we can do is lay down incredible amounts of destruction. So everybody in our unit, all of the Adze pilots are like, \u0026ldquo;Wait, what is this?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd of course they all look to Tamsin.\nAnd, uh– you know, like, the military– there\u0026rsquo;s just like fighting, right? There\u0026rsquo;s just firefighting in the streets. It\u0026rsquo;s street by street fighting. And it is taking too long and there are way too many casualties on the government side.\nSo one day we are… go out on patrol, which we do all the time, you know. Like, we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re ordered to sort of, like, walk around; like, go to different places on the perimeter. This happens frequently. We\u0026rsquo;re ordered to do it. And then we are ordered to fire on the city.\nBRIANNA: I\u0026rsquo;m getting emotional about my own stupid thing!! Okay. It\u0026rsquo;s not stupid. It\u0026rsquo;s– whatever. Okay.\nSATAH: I prime myself for us to both go down, taking Doc with us. And then Brig says, \u0026ldquo;Wait.\u0026rdquo; She slams on the intercom button again to communicate with Doc. And she references, like, a paper that Doc wrote early in her studies, where– and she- she asks, like– she references the thesis that is– that is– it\u0026rsquo;s- ugh. What is it?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like… \u0026ldquo;do you really believe that\u0026rdquo;… I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get to, like– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s something about, like, do you believe that we can transcend something, but I\u0026rsquo;m also trying not to do a, like weird, uh, gets into eugenics territory of \u0026ldquo;creating a better person through technology\u0026rdquo; or- or creating a new… \u0026ldquo;do you think that, uh, mechs or- or mechanical sapient beings are superior to humanity and therefore the future of it.\u0026rdquo; Uh… but it\u0026rsquo;s like…\n[Lengthy gasp] So it\u0026rsquo;s… before she went– it\u0026rsquo;s before Doc specialised in artificial intelligence and machine sapience. It\u0026rsquo;s, like, her undergrad, essentially. And she was studying philosophy, and she wrote like this big capstone paper on free will.\nDEE: You know, like we reach a certain point and it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, now lay down fire support in these coordinates.\u0026rdquo; And this is with, you know, like, these big freaking missiles or like firing cannons with like, you know, shells that are bigger than a person.\nAnd, um, Tamsin says– Tamsin refuses the order And, um… [Big sigh]\nSATAH: And Brig slams on the intercom and asks Doc, like, \u0026ldquo;Do you really believe in free will?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Doc, I think, at this point, is, like, trapped in some way. She- she can\u0026rsquo;t get away. Like, very much at our mercy. And she hesitates and then responds, \u0026ldquo;With the consideration of extenuating circumstances… yes, absolutely I do.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Brig… puts her hand on the transmit button. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t talk. Gathering her thoughts. And she just goes, \u0026ldquo;Well, then act like it.\u0026rdquo;\nBRIANNA: They climb up the station, trying to scramble away in, finding the best possible chance of survival. Not going in head on if they can avoid it. But at a certain point they have to pop up and out and into an open hangar. They\u0026rsquo;re on a runway. At the end of the runway is the throne.\nSATAH: And she takes her hand off the button and she says, \u0026ldquo;Hey, Pick, do you want to get out of here?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I have, like, slight alarm going off about, like, mission parameters, and I say, \u0026ldquo;All indications show that this is our chance to–\u0026rdquo;\nAn P– and Brig goes, \u0026ldquo;Pick! Is that what you want? Or you want to get out of here?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I look at the, like, pinned collapsed mech of Doc in front of us. And I see– I have to see her face, right? Like I see through the– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s not that the cockpit has, like, a broken window. It\u0026rsquo;s that, like, she\u0026rsquo;s low enough power that the, like, blackout coating isn\u0026rsquo;t active anymore. It\u0026rsquo;s, like, a battery-powered thing that she can turn on and off and it has to be off because there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough power. So I can see her face.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s- she looks shocked. Like she has been scared, but right now she is just like, \u0026ldquo;What the- what the fuck is this? What- what does this mean?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd part of me is tempted to take her with us. My worry is that that is too much of a win for our side. There should be consequences to this, right? And that would technically be taking out the enemy ace.\nDEE: [Hard exhale] I think that the whole unit refuses the order, right? Like, so then, like, immediately the order is given to her second-in-command, her lieutenant to, you know, to relieve her of command and take over the mission. And that person, you know, refuses the order.\nAnd, um it comes down to… another unit is sent in and Tamsin talked to them,and I think I talked to the intelligences that they have. But they don\u0026rsquo;t have intelligences, they have- they don\u0026rsquo;t have artificial general intelligences, right? Like they have- they have like a- an expert program that is very good at doing things with a mech and can sort of talk to you like the computer in Star Trek can talk to you, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a person. So there\u0026rsquo;s nothing I can do there.\nShe talks to the pilots and they are– they don\u0026rsquo;t want to fight her, but they make it clear that they\u0026rsquo;re going to follow the order and they just ask her to get out of the way.\nAnd she says, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t do that.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: It\u0026rsquo;s fun to me if we take her. So what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is invent a justification for it, which is that, like… she\u0026rsquo;s not popular in the internal structure in, like, command on her side. Like she\u0026rsquo;s very, very good at what she does and she has a lot of respect and so they have to keep her in the field, but they don\u0026rsquo;t like her. She has dangerous ideas about the importance of mechs and- and their personhood, uh– I am going to, in fact, decide that that is, that is the way that she is– and even has opinions about how the resources that we\u0026rsquo;re fighting over? How they should be used and who we should ask what they want from them. And so they have been kind of trying to get her killed\u0026gt;\nDEE: This is the moment of decision where all of these things have been flashing through my head. And part of me wants to– I\u0026rsquo;m receiving that shutdown order, the one that\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026ldquo;shut down the mech.\u0026rdquo; Like \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t- don\u0026rsquo;t let- don\u0026rsquo;t go rogue,\u0026rdquo; but they know it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Uh, they\u0026rsquo;re kind of hoping against hope it will work.\nI could let that go through and we would live. We would live. We probably couldn\u0026rsquo;t be together anymore after this. I mean, Tamsin would feel betrayed for one thing, but also she\u0026rsquo;d– she\u0026rsquo;s probably going to be arrested, but we would both live. She would live.\nThe other thing that I consider very seriously is that I could eject her. I could eject the cockpit and I could do this fight alone. But I\u0026rsquo;ll fail. I\u0026rsquo;ll fail. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason that I have Tamsin. Because I can pilot this thing, I can shoot the guns, but like, I don\u0026rsquo;t have the– [Snapping her fingers] the fuckin spark, you know? So if we want to protect this revolution, we have to fight together. Even though I know that whether it\u0026rsquo;s here and now or soon, it\u0026rsquo;ll lead to our death.\nBRIANNA: There are weapons firing. The Hurricane stands and says, \u0026ldquo;What are you doing here? You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be at Fort Anchor. What are you doing here?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd there is a clash. They leap up from the runway, slam blades into the Hurricane\u0026rsquo;s eyes, into their face. And the Hurricane screams in fury. Grabs the mech. Crushes the cockpit.\nDEE: I just tell Tamsin, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m with you.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she raises our cannon. And she draws a bead on these mechs flying in. And she fires on them to keep them out of the city.\nBRIANNA: Sapphire hears Topaz grunt in pain, knows that they won\u0026rsquo;t survive this, that this is not the 1.2% chance.\nAnd retracts one of their blades, takes out a gun and just fires down the middle, cutting the Hurricane in half.\nSATAH: When I say \u0026ldquo;Yes, I would like to get out of here.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m also the one who asks Doc, \u0026ldquo;Would you like to come with us?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Wh-wh– you don\u0026rsquo;t have to bring me to a second location. You can just kill me here.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;That is not what I asked. Would you like to leave with us?\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: It\u0026rsquo;s a long fight. Because it\u0026rsquo;s like, you know, we waste those guys, whatever. We beat the White Witch. But mutiny is not going to fly. Civil unrest is dangerous enough. Mutiny is too dangerous. And we get overwhelming force brought to bear on us.\nSATAH: And Doc has these, like horrified, awed eyes, just marveling and goes, \u0026ldquo;Heh. Fuck yeah, I would.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: And, uh, the unit fights with us, the other intelligences fight with us, and one by one they go dark. Their armor, their thick armor gets broken into, the intelligences die, and the pilots die. And… and so do we. Eventually.\nBRIANNA: The Hurricane falls, but the carrier is still going. As Topaz sits there, choking on their own blood, she says, \u0026ldquo;Run! Get out! Get out of here!\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: Just bit by bit, I take too many hits, my armor gets chewed through. Tamsin is so fast, and she\u0026rsquo;s so smart, and she\u0026rsquo;s so good, and she keeps winning. She keeps beating pilot after pilot after pilot. And she hates it, because she\u0026rsquo;s killing her comrades.\nSATAH: And I… pick up her lifeless mech… and we leave.\nBRIANNA: The last thing that we see is shots firing.\nDEE: But eventually… no mech is that tough, no armor is that strong, no pilot is that good. We run out of ammunition. We try to fight with just my hands and legs, and we get- we get blown apart.\nBRIANNA: Sapphire says, \u0026ldquo;I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll introduce me to Cereza. It would be nice to witness something beautiful together.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: Not that we can know this, but… this example, and the material help, right, of, like, stopping a bombing run for hours. It makes a difference on the ground. It sets an example to people around the world and to the military. And the military is not conclusively with the government. They are divided as this conflict goes forward.\nBRIANNA: And then there\u0026rsquo;s a shot. And that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nSATAH: And this is a win for the enemy. With her out of the way, they are able to promote people who will toe the party line. And they are able to organise their forces in a way that is strictly more advantageous. And they are able to– nobody knows what happened to her. So they\u0026rsquo;re able to just like, martyr her, right? And use that against us. And this, like, incontrovertibly, is way better for them than for us. For our side. For our former side.\nDEE: The resistance, although we can\u0026rsquo;t know this, is eventually going to come out on top. And it will be a new world. And it may not be a perfect world, but it will be a world that will end this goddamn war.\nSATAH: And so the war goes on, and it tips towards our enemy. But we\u0026rsquo;re not there. We just start going as far as we possibly can. We hit areas where there are perimeter proximity alarms that we didn\u0026rsquo;t even know existed, saying like, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re leaving the fucking solar system. Are you sure? You don\u0026rsquo;t appear to be in a ship, you appear to be in a single mech. What\u0026rsquo;s up? Hey. You\u0026rsquo;re getting a little far out.\u0026rdquo;\nDEE: Girls are going to get to grow up and be pilots, and machines will be used to build and grow and help things rather than to kill.\nSATAH: And we have to do some heists. [Laughs] We, like, steal some equipment, some chargers. And I think this is another reason why it sucks more for our side: we know our security, and we\u0026rsquo;re able to get in and out before anybody knows to watch for us. So we steal a bunch of shit, and we just keep going. And we\u0026rsquo;re not really sure where or what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do. And we know that the war is going to keep just ravaging behind us.\nBut we\u0026rsquo;re not going to be there.\nDEE: The end.\nBRIANNA: No happy endings. That\u0026rsquo;s the– that\u0026rsquo;s the life. That\u0026rsquo;s the world.\nSATAH: Yay!\nBRIANNA: So, the end! \u0026ldquo;Now that the game is over, you can take a moment to talk about what you\u0026rsquo;ve done together. Check in on how everyone\u0026rsquo;s doing.\u0026rdquo; Ahhh!!\n\u0026ldquo;Relax and decompress. This game has the potential to be intense.\u0026rdquo; Yeah. No, I, uh, god.\nDEE: \u0026ldquo;Check in on how everyone\u0026rsquo;s doing. Relax and decompress. This game has the potential to be intense.\u0026rdquo; And I have to say that was more intense than I thought it was going to be.\nBRIANNA: You ever make up a situation and then get sad about it? Um… because I do. I\u0026rsquo;ve done that. Many a time.\nDEE: I… I love Tamsin. I\u0026rsquo;m sad that we both had to die. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s- uh, it\u0026rsquo;s what she would have wanted. She was a good person. And, uh, she cared. And, uh, she cared about others, and she cared about the larger world, and… I hope that… I hope that\u0026rsquo;s something that I can carry forward myself, which is a crazy thing to take away from a solo game about a mech who\u0026rsquo;s in love with a person.\nSATAH: That was so fun. That was so fun. What a good game.\nBRIANNA: This was great. I really think this game is fantastic. I really enjoyed doing this in a kind of random prompting situation. I think that\u0026rsquo;s a fun way to play it. I would recommend heavily for folks to do that. I think they should create D30s just for this game.\nDEE: This was soo fun. I had a blast recording it. I was like, am I really going to get, like, a long enough recording out of this? And my goodness, I certainly did. So I hope you enjoyed it.\nBRIANNA: Thanks folks.

You can sign up at any paid tier now to see the VOD of that before its public release next month.\nThis is episode one of our games of Immanence, a game on a colony ship a thousand years in the future about \u0026ldquo;exploring our individual and collective relationships with Earth, each other, ourselves, and the greater universe\u0026rdquo; by Marcus Hose.\nThe other two passengers blearily blinking the stasis out of their eyes with me are Jam Edwards and garbageface aka gnostic front aka Karol Orzechowski. Tell you a little bit more about them at the break.\nIn Immanence, you begin having just woken up from cryo sleep during a long journey across space. You play out a series of events across the days of your trip, which for our purposes, I asked to be exactly a week long. The ship can be on a longer journey, going somewhere that takes more than seven days to get to, but no matter what, we are only awake for those final seven days.\nTo start off, we have to figure out why we left Earth, where we\u0026rsquo;re going, and generally what our deals are.\nGAME: SET-UP GF: Um, I guess I should introduce myself. My name is garbageface aka thee gnostic front.\nJAM: Hello! You are now hearing the voice of Jam Edwards, who is a writer, librarian, podcast co-host, and also game player and sometimes game designer.\nGF: And I\u0026rsquo;m playing the game Immanence for Satah\u0026rsquo;s Folio podcast.\nSATAH: [Hitting the last syllable with an extended hiss] Immanence…\nJAM: And today I am playing Immanence by Marcus Hose, which can be a multi-player game or a solo game.\nGF: I\u0026rsquo;m really excited that Satah asked me to do this. I have never, ever, ever, ever done something like this before.\nJAM: I do podcasts all the time, but I\u0026rsquo;m already so self-conscious because I never ever do them alone.\nGF: So I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that for all the listeners out there that you\u0026rsquo;ll be gentle with me as I, uh fuck around and then– or as I– sorry, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember if I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to swear or not– as I frig around and find out.\nJAM: I haven\u0026rsquo;t played a ton of solo games either, and I also usually don\u0026rsquo;t have to talk through my thought process when I play a solo game.\nGF: With all of that said, let us get started. I might add a little arpeggio here if that\u0026rsquo;s acceptable.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Immanence is a game for 1-5 players about the passengers of a colony ship that has left Earth in the year 3020 in pursuit of a new home. Each player controls a human passenger of said ship as they are awoken from stasis sleep.\u0026rdquo;\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;The game is primarily driven by the interactions and emotions exchanged between multiple players or the reflections of a single player.\u0026rdquo;\nGF: \u0026ldquo;The purpose of Immanence is to explore individual and collective relationships with Earth, with each other, ourselves, and the greater universe.\u0026rdquo;\nJAM: I have my paper, I have my pencil, I have my 20-sided dice, and I think I\u0026rsquo;m ready to go.\nGF: I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading through all of the rules and I haven\u0026rsquo;t read the prompts because I want those to be a surprise.\nJAM: The rules up top are \u0026ldquo;No violence of any sort,\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: No violence.\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;No lying,\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: No lying.\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;and feel free to break the rules if all players are comfortable doing so.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Break rules as a team. Great.\nJAM: This game did come with a character sheet which I foolishly did not print out, but I have a piece of paper. It\u0026rsquo;s not a terribly complicated character sheet, but I can choose a name and pronouns for my character. And then the other details, I think we are mostly going to be rolling from tables here using our 20-sided die.\nGF: [Defeated chuckle] I was just talking for the last, gosh… 15 minutes or so. I really had some good shit goin\u0026rsquo; and uh… for some reason I was not recording. These things happen, of course. Nothing too much to be sad about. I\u0026rsquo;m going to– rather than doing all the establishing again, what I am going to do is just tell you the establishing stuff that I did.\nSATAH: So the very first thing that we decide, part one, is departure.\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;The game begins by rolling on the following table to decide the inciting incident that prompted humanity to leave Earth and picking a name for the colony ship.\u0026rdquo; So I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and roll on this table that will tell me why I\u0026rsquo;m leaving Earth.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Rolled a fourteen. Eleven to fourteen is \u0026ldquo;New neighbours: a previously undiscovered sentient race has made contact with Earth from another planet, established friendly and generous relations, and invited humanity to participate in a massive cultural exchange.\u0026rdquo; Hmm…\nGF: I rolled for destination that I\u0026rsquo;m on a cultural exchange with a nearby planet.\nJAM: Oh, I got a thirteen, which is \u0026ldquo;new neighbours.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s interesting for sure because that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really speak actually to a mass migration, right? This could be that we\u0026rsquo;re just sending folks off to meet some aliens.\nJAM: I will say… I listened to Satah\u0026rsquo;s example of this game Satah sent me, just like an example of their setup and first day or two of play, and I know they got the same one. And so I\u0026rsquo;m a little tempted to re-roll.\nSATAH: Do I want to re-roll that because I want a little bit more drama behind it? No, I\u0026rsquo;m going to see how that plays out. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting because that\u0026rsquo;s a very different type of anxiety than the others. Like– not all of the others, but for instance, \u0026ldquo;complete climate catastrophe.\u0026rdquo; This has a very specific, different feeling to it of, like, why you\u0026rsquo;re on this journey.\nJAM: But I\u0026rsquo;m also tempted to soldier on and see how differently we play the same prompt. Yeah, I really like new neighbours as a prompt.\nSATAH: So I\u0026rsquo;m going to stick with new neighbours. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go meet up with a bunch of other aliens and whoever\u0026rsquo;s out there in the galaxy.\nJAM: So this is not necessarily a scenario where we\u0026rsquo;re being forced to leave Earth. This is a scenario where we are choosing or at least compelled to travel beyond our home to make new friends, which, you know– feels very appealing to me, especially in this kind of game where it seems set up to be more utopian and less cynical.\nGF: I called the planet Poseidon, and, uh, the… inhabitants of the planet Poseidon, even though there are probably many different types of inhabitants and they go by many things, the name of those inhabitants are Aquamenis.\nJAM: One of the other podcasts I co-host is a holiday music podcast and, uh, the only– the only way that this and that podcast are related is I\u0026rsquo;ve been obsessed this year with a particular holiday song by a band called Christmas Aguilera. Um, and it\u0026rsquo;s Christmas on Mars, which is a song about leaving Earth for Mars for climate reasons, but then arriving on Mars and making new friends and celebrating Christmas together. I\u0026rsquo;m an absolute sucker for that kind of thing. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m going to include Christmas in my story, but you know, who knows?\nSATAH: And I need to name the ship. \u0026ldquo;All ships have the prefix Terran Colony ship, TCS.\u0026rdquo;\nJAM: So the examples they gave are TCS Marsha P. Johnson, TCS Mae Carol Jemison, who was the first Black woman in space. They gave a bunch more. TCS Dracula, TCS Cold Side of the Pillow. I do like that these examples give you an idea of the tone they\u0026rsquo;re going for, which is more positive because my first instinct for, like, \u0026ldquo;name the ship that\u0026rsquo;s leaving Earth\u0026rdquo;, um, name your colony ship, my first instinct is \u0026ldquo;the TCS Wonder sponsored by Disney Plus.\u0026rdquo; [Laughing] But that\u0026rsquo;s a different game. Yeah. So I do appreciate the tone setting that these examples are doing.\nSATAH: Random word generator. The first one that came up was magnitude, which is great. Strap, liability, machinery, sphere.\nTCS Magnitude feels great. And I love that it\u0026rsquo;s… stupid. Kinda. Like, big ship. We call it Magnitude.\nMaybe a bunch of these ships are named after, like, feelings that they– want to be inspired, like the idea of like the TCS Awe. I know that\u0026rsquo;s not quite the same type of word of Magnitude, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun. So.\nGF: The name of the ship that I\u0026rsquo;m on is the TCS Lone Ranger.\nJAM: Yeah, I did think about this before I sat down, which feels a little bit meta gaming, but here we are. I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to name my ship the TCS- right? TCS Ay-da… possibly Ah-da. The TCS Ada Limón. But we call it the Ada for short.\nAda Limón is a poet who was poet laureate of the US and… possibly still is? I don\u0026rsquo;t know how often they choose poet laureate, but it was a poet that one of the young people that I work with in my daytime life introduced me to who did write a poem for space, and I think– \u0026ldquo;a poem for space.\u0026rdquo; A poem to go on a, like, NASA mission to space. And I do think we have a culture of space exploration that does that kind of thing, that– that values poetry in a way that I think lots of other, y\u0026rsquo;know, sciences doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily.\nSo I do think in this utopian or semi utopian future, it makes sense for ships to be named after poets and maybe even specifically after former poet laureates of the United States, if that… I mean. In my utopian future, the United States is not a thing. However! I\u0026rsquo;m keeping the name, the Ada.\nSATAH: For the podcast, I\u0026rsquo;ve asked everybody to have their journey be seven days long, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that the ship is going somewhere that is only seven days away, but that they will only be awake, regardless, of the past– the– for the last seven days. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll and see where we\u0026rsquo;re headed to and see if I\u0026rsquo;m awake for the whole time.\n[Die clattering] I rolled an eight, which is Mars. Fourteen days.\nJAM: So we know we\u0026rsquo;re going for new neighbours. Where are we going? It would be wild if I roll the moon. They\u0026rsquo;ve just been here! Or, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s the meeting spot. They\u0026rsquo;re being really kind to us. Let me roll.\nThe moon, for reference– we\u0026rsquo;ve got different planets here that I could get for this role for where we are going and how long the trip is, and the moon is seven days away. So let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nNo, I got an eleven. So Saturn is where we are going. The trip is forty-nine days. We are just going to be playing the last seven days of that trip.\nSATAH: So I\u0026rsquo;m going to say my destination is Mars and my duration is seven days, but out of fourteen. So I\u0026rsquo;m up for the last half of the trip.\nJAM: Saturn is a good one for this plot, I think. It\u0026rsquo;s a good landmark to meet at, you know. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty distinct looking planet and further out in our– in our own solar system, so we\u0026rsquo;re putting a little bit of effort in.\nSATAH: For emergence, basically why I\u0026rsquo;ve been awoken, it says roll for or choose the circumstances of their awakening, but there doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually seem to be a list? Uh, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if maybe I should try rolling on something else…\nJAM: On the one hand, I think it\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate because I would I would like to see what the creator of the game intended here, what kind of different circumstances they were imagining– if they were all like, you know, you get woken up for your birthday! Or if there were some like, something hit the ship and you had to like, emergency be woken up. Um, but I also think it will be really interesting to hear how Satah and I handle this piece of it differently.\nSATAH: I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll again on the departure table and see if I can just interpret the prompt in a way that makes sense? Let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nJAM: I think how I\u0026rsquo;m going to handle this is since this is a 20 sided die based game, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do what is called a luck roll and just roll the d20 and if it is closer to one, that is a bad reason, a bad reason I was woken up or, you know, unplanned, negative. I want to keep it vague because I kind of want to do more fleshing out of this character and maybe even play through a day or two before I decide specifically why I am awake, especially if it\u0026rsquo;s a bad reason. And yeah, twenty is, is– planned, perfect, ideal wake up.\nIf it is– if I get a bad result, so like anything under ten, I want to roll again and see if it that means I was woken up early or I was woken up late. Because I think for a trip of forty-nine days, that is like just long enough for either of those to come with different sort of interesting baggage. Okay.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Got a seven, which is \u0026ldquo;complete climate catastrophe.\u0026rdquo; And… and what if that means that I was woken up because… there\u0026rsquo;s been a systems failure of some kind? Not, uh, in a way that endangers the life of everyone on the ship, but maybe it\u0026rsquo;s like… I\u0026rsquo;ve been in stasis, breathing, like, a very specific– everyone in stasis is like breathing a specific concoction of like, uh… whatever medicinal air, right, to keep them kind of alive despite their like kind of artificially comatose state. And maybe something got into… the air?\nYeah. So it\u0026rsquo;s– it is an artificial climate catastrophe, but specifically only for certain sections of people who are in stasis.\nJAM: So, first, the luck roll. Oh, funny. Okay. I rolled a 10. So the exact midpoint. Huh. Yeah.\nI mean, I will roll again and… I think for this one, if it\u0026rsquo;s closer to one, I was woken up late. If it\u0026rsquo;s closer to 20, I was woken up early.\nI know I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the bad result, but I just want to see if I get 10 again, I was woken up exactly on time, but maybe something else was not ideal.\nOkay. Nine. So just ever slightly late. Um, so I had a real middle of the road emergence, neither ideal nor like extremely unplanned.\nSo I think the fact that I was just slightly late is maybe part of what was bad about it. I just missed like a couple of days that I was supposed to be awake and maybe I missed something that I had been looking forward to on those days. Yeah. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get too specific. Maybe I came up with seasickness, space sickness. Um.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m not even totally sure why I would be in stasis for a two week trip? But maybe it\u0026rsquo;s… it\u0026rsquo;s probably been longer, but maybe people are largely only awake for those two weeks? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how long it would take to get to Mars. It\u0026rsquo;s longer than fourteen days, right? But is that true in the year 3020? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say… I was woken up because there was a breakdown in the artificial conditions of my particular block of stasis pods.\nJAM: Okay, next I am rolling my bunk number…\nSATAH: by rolling a 20 sided die until I\u0026rsquo;ve got five digits. So two, nine, nineteen, twenty.\nJAM: That\u0026rsquo;s a twenty. That\u0026rsquo;s a six. That\u0026rsquo;s a four. And that\u0026rsquo;s a fifteen. But all I need is one more digit so we\u0026rsquo;ll just take that one.\nGF: And my bunk number is 18107.\nSATAH: So my bunk number is 291920.\nJAM: So bunk number 20641.\nSATAH: The wifi password is password!\nJAM: Which is a silly fun detail. And I\u0026rsquo;d say not very secure, but I guess since we\u0026rsquo;re going to meet new aliens, we want– we all want to be able to remember and offer them the wifi password. Assuming they know what that is.\nSATAH: For character creation… definitely not the focus of this game, which makes, uh– makes sense. Just like it kind of seems like it wants to throw you right into the sort of interpersonal stuff. So it just basically– it says like your character can be and look like whatever.\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;Personal traits and appearance, your character can look and act in any way you desire. The entirety of human behavior and morphology are fair game, but bear in mind the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t have built-in rules for confrontation, physical altercation, or deception.\u0026rdquo; I do appreciate that the game is explicitly like, don\u0026rsquo;t bother min-maxing because you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be– there\u0026rsquo;s no stats. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to build Dwayne the Rock Johnson. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nUm, I do tend to like more structure for character creation, uh– even, you know, just a few questions here would be great.\nAnd there is a spot on the character sheet for name pronouns, birthplace, and a picture of the passenger ID photo.\nSATAH: I… think that I am okay going in with a– with a pretty loose idea of what I\u0026rsquo;m up to. Hopefully kind of the first day I\u0026rsquo;ll get prompts that somehow shape more of a person? Like, might– maybe there will be requests made of me or something that makes my purpose, as it were, a little bit more obvious, but I do want to come up with a name.\nGF: My name is Terrence Halbersham. It\u0026rsquo;s a rather old sounding name, especially for the year 3020. But that\u0026rsquo;s the name that came to my mind.\nJAM: I think my character was born in Providence. That is a city that is close to my heart. Providence, Rhode Island. If I\u0026rsquo;m writing, it is probably about Providence. There\u0026rsquo;s also a lot of universities there, um. And I… want to say maybe my… maybe my character is an academic of some kind, since this is, like, a cultural exchange trip.\nDo I want them to be on the academic or cultural side or do I… well, yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I would have been in stasis if I was part of the, like, technical crew of the ship, if I had a more practical role.\nWhat is my name? And my pronouns. I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make a they. I\u0026rsquo;m going to put a they in space. That\u0026rsquo;s what I do.\nGF: I am a quartz, uh– I– because this is a cultural exchange, I assumed that probably the biggest slash most important aspect of it was the culture part. So I decided that I was a quartz painter. Now what is a quartz painter? Well, let me tell you.\nTerrence Halbersham developed a… I guess, proprietary, although it\u0026rsquo;s never been copywritten or anything like that… developed a new kind of painting called quartz painting. And usually the way paint pigments– or at least back in the day, the way paint pigments were made was by taking a medium such as linseed oil and suspending pigments, usually in the form of a powder in that medium and then mixing that and using it to- using it to paint.\nThe way that my painting method differed, and I believe the reason that I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to be on this cultural exchange, is because what I would do is take pulverized quartz– quartz that\u0026rsquo;s been ground into a really, really fine powder, and mix that with liquid– a proprietary form of water, a particular liquid form of water. And that would create the medium in which you could suspend, uh, suspend pigments in.\nNow you might be saying to yourself, who cares? Well. The reason that this was remarkable is that one, it had never been done before. And two, it resulted in a kind of shimmering, very real, very alive look in the paintings that I\u0026rsquo;ve done. I\u0026rsquo;ve often created both portraits and landscapes that represent the people and places that I love. And these paintings are, um– they glow with a certain- a certain je ne sais quoi, thanks to the use of my very special and heretofore unknown quartz paint.\nJAM: Is this– is this too wild? I mean, um… okay. The thing that\u0026rsquo;s coming to my brain for what my character, the sort of field that my character is in as part of this cultural exchange is that they\u0026rsquo;re a puppeteer? Which is slightly less wild because there is– there are some, like, large puppeteering troops and traditions in New England, like specifically the Big Nazo troop in Providence is who I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of. And I have definitely met, uh– I used to work in Providence, and in the neighborhood where Rizdi and Brown are, and had students who were, like, interning with Big Nazo come in to the library where I was working, looking for books to inspire them. And it was, you know, it stuck with me because it was a really fun ask. It\u0026rsquo;s really fun just like, \u0026ldquo;Get me a book with weird stuff that I can build a puppet about.\u0026rdquo;\nUm, so– would- would we put Big Nazo in space? I mean in an ideal world, yes.\nThat implies to me that this is a fairly– maybe not a fairly big crew, but maybe a fairly diverse– they- they are– like, the prompt I think said \u0026ldquo;a massive cultural exchange.\u0026rdquo; So I think they have chosen people from lots of different fields with different skills because they don\u0026rsquo;t really know what is and isn\u0026rsquo;t going to translate. You know, they, we\u0026rsquo;ve got poets, we\u0026rsquo;ve got writers, we\u0026rsquo;ve got visual artists and dancers and- and singers and songwriters. But, like, if our- our new connections– if these, these folks that we\u0026rsquo;re meeting up with, their brands just don\u0026rsquo;t process music the same way that our brains do, if it turns out music is something unique to our planet, then I mean, A, that\u0026rsquo;s cool. But B, they- they, I think, want to explore lots of different possibilities to- to connect culturally. Um, if… if music is not clicking… maybe puppets! Maybe puppets.\nThis is happening. It\u0026rsquo;s a they. They\u0026rsquo;re a puppeteer. And I think maybe even specifically, they, uh, make puppets. And there maybe is one or two other people from their troupe with them? Um, maybe just one. I think maybe they sent one designer and one performer and this character is a designer. And so, is coming to like support the performer, like to- to, you know, has some experience with- with the performing part of it, um but in their day to day job on Earth, they are mostly doing the design aspects and- and working with materials and- and creating new- new puppets. Or repairing puppets. And they may have a hope of make– if- if it turns out puppets really click with the new, uh, the new extra extraterrestrials that we\u0026rsquo;re meeting, making them a puppet would be– would be the dream.\nGF: For me in role playing games, it\u0026rsquo;s not difficult to be a different kind of person, but the thing that\u0026rsquo;s difficult for me to imagine is being in a different body. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what that is. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s a psychological… something to it, um, but I find it really hard to imagine what it would be like to live, uh… let\u0026rsquo;s say as a very tall person. Um, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to try it anyway.\nI am– Terrence Halberstam is very tall. And that is especially remarkable in this context because for, for spaceships, space agencies actually usually pick people who are quite short and who… I mean, essentially, don\u0026rsquo;t take up a lot of space. [Laughing] Every inch and every centimeter counts when you\u0026rsquo;re talking about space storage. So the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m on here is pretty remarkable.\nSATAH: Still looking at my random gerner [Stumbling over words]– I went back to my random word generator. Random germ generator? Is that what I nearly said? I don\u0026rsquo;t want that.\nJAM: And their name… I have to choose. That is what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing here.\nIs there– I mean, I love a name that\u0026rsquo;s also a noun. Obviously. My name is Jam.\nSATAH: Forum Urgency. My name is Forum Urgency and I think most people just call me Four. Or Jen. That\u0026rsquo;s funny. Urgency– Jen being short for Urgency is great. I\u0026rsquo;m a huge fan of regular name that is short for not-regular name.\nJAM: So is there like a… not puppet specific, but I\u0026rsquo;m thinking like textiles and… this is a person who maybe, like, really loves expressing, you know, art through texture and shape… and what would their name be?\nI think Stitch is really literal. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I can do Stitch. I guess there\u0026rsquo;s also… a really famous alien named that. [Laughing] So I– and I do like that Stitch is also a verb. I love a verb as a name too.\nIs their name Wrinkle? This is– this is the hardest part in gaming for me.\nSATAH: Urgency. Jency. I think Jency actually is a– is a more fun nickname. So, For– Forum Urgency, most people just call me Jency.\nJAM: I just sort of paused and I was like, I think I\u0026rsquo;m thinking too hard about puppets and textiles when I don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about that. What is something that reminds me of Providence? And the first word that I thought of was Hill. And so I think this character\u0026rsquo;s name is Hill. They/them. Okay.\nBREAK SATAH: When I invite guests on the show, I give them access to just the first part of whatever my recorded playthrough was so that they can listen to it to understand, like, what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for and have sort of a better sense of what I mean when I say, \u0026ldquo;Hey, sit down and play a solo game out loud.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs]\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really important to me that I don\u0026rsquo;t influence people\u0026rsquo;s playthroughs too much because the whole point is to hear what different people do with the same game, but I want people to know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing and feel good about being on the show, so. That is what I provide. That is why Jam mentioned knowing what my basic scenario was.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s so funny to me that we all ended up with the same basic scenario– in a way, it\u0026rsquo;s sort of, um, the podcast concept concentrated? Like, not only playing the same game, but playing the same basic plot, or at least large structure and still doing very different things with it, so. Very exciting.\nGenerally very excited about these guests. They are both incredibly dear friends of mine and from very different areas of my life. I love it when there are weird coincidences across playthroughs, and there are a couple of things that both of these guests mentioned. A certain sport being illegal comes up organically. And they also both, when I asked them, \u0026ldquo;Hey, anything you want to plug?\u0026rdquo; Decided to tell me just sort of a concept, rather than a project. This was in completely separate email threads, never having interacted with each other as far as I know. I live for that shit. It makes me so happy. Coincidences, patterns, they\u0026rsquo;re fun!\nJam Edwards is a librarian, writer, and general creator of things. At their website, rjmakes.com, raspberry jam makes dot com, you will find cool published sci-fi stories, podcasts, including one about holiday music that has nearly 400 episodes at this point, and a bunch of games that they designed. We met on Tumblr something like 15 years ago. One time in response to me threatening to make very stupid business cards, they said, \u0026ldquo;Maybe millennials could afford mansions if they didn\u0026rsquo;t commit to so many bits,\u0026rdquo; and I still have the custom t-shirt that I made with that quote on it. I love them. And I am so, so happy that they could be on this show.\ngarbageface, aka gnostic front, aka Karol Orzechowski is a musician, photographer, and writer of a fantastic full moon newsletter. His playthrough of this game came to me accompanied by a full improvised synth soundtrack, which you\u0026rsquo;ll hear small snippets of through the interstitials in this series. We met in the Peterborough music scene about a decade ago. One time, for reasons that I have literally no memory of, he said to me, \u0026ldquo;life is a dog\u0026rsquo;s wet nose in your armpit.\u0026rdquo; And I freehand cross-stitched that onto some fabric alongside a representation of his dog\u0026rsquo;s nose. I don\u0026rsquo;t know who that object is now, but I know that I love him and I\u0026rsquo;m so, so happy that he was willing to try something very new to be on this show. If you are interested in the themes and vibes explored in this game, I think you should particularly start with any and all of these three garbageface albums: NO FUTURE, DYMAXION, [Stumbling] Enantiodromia. Anti– oh my goodness. ENANTIODROMIA. You will find stuff that you like in there. And then you should listen to PLAGUE MECHANIC, because it\u0026rsquo;s just my favourite right now.\nAs for me and the show, hello, I\u0026rsquo;m Satah, this is my show! Thank you, you\u0026rsquo;re listening to it. I am a game designer, editor, and musician. You can find a bunch of my work at gaygothvibes.online– which, by the way, is a domain that was originally given to me by Jam and features a bio written for me by garbageface! [Laughing] Uh… I released an EP at the end of last year called it\u0026rsquo;s really only. You can find it at peopleyoumeetoutsideofbars.bandcamp.com as well as your preferred music rental service.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s get into the main loop of the game. Day in the life. A series of days in the life. Each day in Immanence is divided into four chunks of time. Morning, afternoon, evening, and the dead of night. For every chunk of time, you roll a random event and react to it. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how our passengers\u0026rsquo; first days awake go.\nGAME: DAY ONE MORNING SATAH: So day one begins. [Chuckles] Have some kind of rude awakening early in the morning.\nGF: The first action that I rolled… I\u0026rsquo;m waking up on the morning.\nJAM: I am awake and was maybe supposed to be awake a day or two before this, but. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen on our first day here.\nSATAH: Each day has- has four six hour segments that you roll for like a little event that happened at some point during.\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;To figure out what happens day to day, starting with the day the passengers emerge, all players will roll for the day\u0026rsquo;s events four times a day.\u0026rdquo; First day, let\u0026rsquo;s start with our morning roll. \u0026ldquo;This is the core of the game.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m reading now, \u0026ldquo;Rolling or choosing days events and acting them out, discussing them, or jus ruminating on them,\u0026rdquo; since we\u0026rsquo;re playing solo.\nGF: So my first morning prompt was– I rolled a one. And the prompt is \u0026ldquo;a group of passengers is heading to the gymnasium block and they say they\u0026rsquo;re short one player for a team game. What are they playing and do you join them? Is it fun?\u0026rdquo; Um… [Laughs] It\u0026rsquo;s going to feel weird saying this all again, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nWhat I described was that the players in the game are playing a game of Galactic Pickleball. Galactic Pickleball is… uh, by 3020, Galactic Pickleball is the only… sport. It\u0026rsquo;s the only sport. The reason it\u0026rsquo;s the only sport is because most other sports have fallen out of favour for various reasons.\nFor example, football was essentially canceled culturally because of just, um… further traumatic head injuries that just never stopped. You can still watch football, but the leagues that exist are all renegade and extralegal. Hockey did exist until preparing ice on planet Earth became untenable. Baseball, uh… has never been a good sport and therefore just went away naturally. Soccer, even though it was watched by billions of people, that was before World War V and ever since World War V, no one has been able to look at a soccer ball ever again.\nSo people play Galactic Pickleball. And what is Galactic Pickleball, you may be asking yourself? How is it different? Well, the answer to you, dear listener, is that it\u0026rsquo;s not different. It\u0026rsquo;s the same. Pretty much everything has the word Galactic in front of it now because we\u0026rsquo;re in 2030, so, uh that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s called Galactic Pickleball.\nI will note, however, though, that one of the ways that this- this particular game is different in the pickleball arena is that this gymnasium block actually has, uh, gravity enabled, and so the ball more or less moves in the way that it would move on Earth. While there are some versions of Galactic Pickleball where people just allow the ball to go in a straight line from where it is hit, in this game, the ball goes up and down, just like a regular ball with a regular gravity.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what the other- that\u0026rsquo;s what the other passengers are playing. I noticed that my friend, uh… and I\u0026rsquo;m using a name generator here. This person\u0026rsquo;s a doctor. Their name is Dr. Juno Zorander. I noticed my friend Juno in that group, and it\u0026rsquo;s, uh… Juno\u0026rsquo;s one of those people who really– they don\u0026rsquo;t take no for an answer. They really can convince anyone to do almost anything, and the way that they do this is through the classic mechanism of guilt, of the kind of like, \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rsquo;mahnn. What are you doing right now? C\u0026rsquo;mahnnnn.\u0026rdquo;\nBut in spite of Juno\u0026rsquo;s entreatises, I don\u0026rsquo;t join, and the reason for not joining is because I\u0026rsquo;m just waking up from stasis, man, and I have not stretched. It\u0026rsquo;s been a very long time being in stasis. I am extremely stiff, and if I don\u0026rsquo;t do my stretches in the morning, I am just no good. So.\nThat being said, I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a little social. I\u0026rsquo;ve been holed up in stasis for a while, and I actually join them at the gymnasium block, and I watch them play Galactic Pickleball as I do my stretches.\nJuno is playing with our friend Dr. Tudor, Dr. Jago Tudor, and our other friend… Dr. Zhao.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to write down some names here. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s doctors, apparently, because we\u0026rsquo;re on a… we\u0026rsquo;re on a ship that is, uh… y\u0026rsquo;know, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to be like a science-y type.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re all playing Galactic Pickleball. They\u0026rsquo;re playing, uh– they wanted to play doubles, but now they\u0026rsquo;re playing a third two-on-one, which is, you know. It\u0026rsquo;s totally fine. They\u0026rsquo;re not bummed, and they actually don\u0026rsquo;t even… you know, after they bugged me a few times to join them, they stop, and I just watch them and do my stretches.\nAnd one of the things that\u0026rsquo;s remarkable to me about watching them is… gosh, y\u0026rsquo;know. Galactic Pickleball is a really fun game. If you like being annoying, and you like being a stickler for the rules, and you like to occasionally yell and make your feelings known in a boisterous manner, Galactic Pickleball really is the sport for you. It\u0026rsquo;s also remarkably uncontroversial, despite all of the controversies that we endured in the early 21st century… twenty… 21st century? Yeah, 21st century. [Laughing] Tune into Folio this week, and listen to garbageface try to figure out what century we are in.\nDespite all the controversies about Pickleball in the 21st century, this game is just beloved by everybody now, and they are just having a great time. They\u0026rsquo;re shaking off their stasis and feeling good. I don\u0026rsquo;t join them, though, and you know what? I feel totally fine about that.\nSATAH: Because of the sort of artificial climate breakdown, whatever it was, it\u0026rsquo;s not quite as gentle of a wake-up as you\u0026rsquo;d usually want. They had to kind of go quickly just to make sure that everything was okay, and I probably was like, hustled right along to the med bay just to be checked over. And I imagine that unless directly contradicted, I\u0026rsquo;m going to be kind of coming out of the med bay back to my room here.\nI rolled an eleven. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a number of former professional kitchen staff among the passengers, and they\u0026rsquo;re taking orders for breakfast. Order anything you\u0026rsquo;d like, including nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is… my first meal! After however long, seven days it seems like, of- if subsisting off of– I assume that people in stasis are, like, intubated in some way. And this is my first meal. And I think… yeah, I was gonna- I was gonna lean– because of that, I was going to say something super hearty, but I think actually I was warned, uh, \u0026ldquo;We had to wake you up really quickly… you\u0026rsquo;re going to want something a little bit light.\u0026rdquo; And so I asked just for like… some toast… and stare wistfully at everybody eating, like, beautiful… eggs benedict and all that kind of thing.\nUgh, god. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while since– there was a place in Peterborough where I used to live that made this incredible vegan eggs benedict that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had since before the pandemic. And… god, I miss that.\nSo yeah. I just– I have to keep it super light because my stomach\u0026rsquo;s still kind of weirdy from being woken up from stasis so quickly. I just have some toast.\nAnd I think that one of the things here is just that like, it\u0026rsquo;s a little strange to just slip into the world like this. Usually there would probably be an announcement of like, we\u0026rsquo;re going to wake people up, but they had to do this in the middle of the night really unexpectedly. And so I just kind of am a new person. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s like an excitement in novelty there. But I think that there are enough people on the ship that it takes a while to notice. And so it\u0026rsquo;s a little- it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit lonely.\nJAM: So for the morning, what is happening between 6am and noon? A twenty. Wow. \u0026ldquo;You overhear a conversation. You catch a phrase out of context, a phrase that someone you love is or was fond of using. What was the phrase and who liked to use it?\u0026rdquo; Oh man.\nI like this- this fairly simple one for the first prompt. I overhear a conversation. This is the first day I\u0026rsquo;ve emerged, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m feeling pretty groggy.\nOh man. Oh no. Okay. Yeah. I think– I think I hear someone use a phrase… what was the phrase? I\u0026rsquo;m thinking along the lines of- of the- the rolls I made to decide the circumstances of my emergence and you know, landed on could have been better, was woken up a few days late. I think probably the thing that I missed, based on this first prompt, was maybe a few days ago, people got to call their loved ones on Earth, um, and… we were like in a really good, like, you know, clear spot for that where they\u0026rsquo;re, we were going to have a really clear connection with Earth and, um… maybe has happened before on this 49 day journey? But, but yeah, there was one I was supposed to be awake for that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nAnd I overhear someone using a phrase that… I think… I\u0026rsquo;m imagining Hill is, like, a late twenties they/them, sort of cropped short hair, white, a little shorter than I am in real life, works with their hands a lot, and… I think the person is… an aunt or an uncle that they spent a lot of time with growing up and that, like, nurtured their artistic interests and, you know, saw something in that. And the phrase feels less– like, the specific phrase in this case feels less important, but it is maybe some– something– some kind of encouragement that I overheard, using quite casually in a very low stakes situation, you know, for getting– while they were getting breakfast or something. Somebody else was trying to use the waffle maker, and I think it was something along the lines of like, \u0026ldquo;You get better every time,\u0026rdquo; you know, \u0026ldquo;you get better every time you use that.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it is maybe something that specifically– we\u0026rsquo;ll say this this aunt growing up taught them- taught Hill how to use a sewing machine and would say this to them early on as, like, encouragement when they were struggling and later as like a very sincere like, \u0026ldquo;Gosh, you get better every time! Like, every time I see something new that you\u0026rsquo;ve made, I\u0026rsquo;m blown away.\u0026rdquo; Maybe not that explicitly. But- but you know, that was how the tone of it- it changed through time.\nAnd Hill didn\u0026rsquo;t get to talk to this person yesterday, and um. I think Hill\u0026rsquo;s having a rough morning on this first day. So let\u0026rsquo;s see how the rest of their day goes.\nAFTERNOON GF: It\u0026rsquo;s now the afternoon.\n[Die clattering] \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a number of former professional kitchen staff among the passengers and they\u0026rsquo;re taking orders for lunch. Order anything you\u0026rsquo;d like, including nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m always very careful about what I order coming out of stasis. This is my… I believe this is my fifth galactic trip? Intergalactic trip? And one of the things that I\u0026rsquo;m very careful about is the kind of food that I eat right out of stasis because, um… when your stoma– you know, you have to do essentially a kind of a flush before stasis. So you don\u0026rsquo;t eat anything for 24 hours before that, and one of the big sort of challenges is not upsetting your stomach too much when you get out.\nSo what I\u0026rsquo;m going to order is mashed potatoes.\nThe mashed potatoes arrive 10 minutes later. I assume that they\u0026rsquo;re made out of flakes. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it makes any practical sense to bring potatoes up into space just to mash them. But joke\u0026rsquo;s on you! I love flaked mashed potatoes. I truly, truly love flaked mashed potatoes. In fact, when I got my, uh, wisdom teeth out– when Terrence Halbersham got their wisdom teeth out, they ate a whole box of mashed potatoes. And when– because their mouth was so numb while they were eating the mashed potatoes, they actually ended up with a lot of potato on their face. Which is where the famous expression \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got potato on your face, bud,\u0026rdquo; came from.\nJAM: So let\u0026rsquo;s roll for the afternoon.\nGF: Oh, by the way, after I ate a whole bunch of mashed potatoes, I took another little nap. And I know what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. Who needs a nap after they\u0026rsquo;ve been in stasis for… gosh, a year or more? Well, the truth is, uh… everyone needs a little nap sometimes. I bet you need a little nap right now. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be nice to take a little nap? I think it\u0026rsquo;d be pretty nice to take a little nap.\nJAM: That\u0026rsquo;s a nine. \u0026ldquo;The amateur aerialists club is heading to the gymnasium block for a quick turn on the anti-gravity courts. They\u0026rsquo;re one member short and they invite you to join them. Will you? How long do you stay?\u0026rdquo;\nI mean, of course we have aerialists. I just took a minute to be like, aerialists like– I was thinking aviators. I was like, where are they- are they flying like in VR? No, this is gymnasts, of course. This is like, I\u0026rsquo;m assuming similar to like acrobats or people who do gymnastics at high heights, um, and of course we brought them. We brought so many different kinds of artists with us. Uh, yeah.\nDo I join? No. I think Hill does not join. Hill\u0026rsquo;s having a rough morning. I think Hill– but they\u0026rsquo;re one member short. Maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t know what aerialists are. Maybe they need like a spotter or something, which is why they have invited Hill and- and maybe they\u0026rsquo;re trying to cheer Hill up.\nI assume that we all know each other a little. That there was some, you know, amount of training or orientation that we all went through together, and so there\u0026rsquo;s maybe a little feeling on the ship of that, like… first few weeks of university comradery where you just are inviting people you don\u0026rsquo;t know that well to go do things with you.\nBut yeah, I think Hill, they might do it if they were having a better day, but I think, having just woken up, still being kind of groggy and a little bit upset, they are not going to go here.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just going to search to make sure I am– I do know what an aerialist is. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s an acrobat. Okay. The amateur aerialists club. Well, we would also have expert aerialists, but I guess this isn\u0026rsquo;t them. This is some, maybe, ground gymnasts who are trying out the trying out aerialism in the anti gravity courts.\nUm, no, Hill does not go. Hill is going to be a bit of a loner for this first afternoon. They\u0026rsquo;re still getting their space legs. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that they want to be doing flips on the first day.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll for the afternoon. \u0026ldquo;Another passenger has lost their way to their stasis suite and could use a hand getting back. You know where the suite they\u0026rsquo;re looking for is. Do you help them?\u0026rdquo;\nI can\u0026rsquo;t see a reason why not? I guess I could want to avoid the suites because I had sort of a bummer experience last night, but… I\u0026rsquo;m also curious about why I know where it is.\nI guess the thing that makes the most sense is maybe this is somebody else who was in my block who was woken up from the emergency. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s sort of a range of symptoms of whatever weird thing was happening in our air supply. And this person is clearly much more sort of discombobulated than I am.\nAnd yeah, of course I bring them back and explain that as far as I know… because the stasis suites are also just like our bunks and that kind of thing? So I\u0026rsquo;ll just basically say like, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to think that they\u0026rsquo;re unsafe to be in. That it was exclusively something that would be dangerous when you are in that stasis state. And… that was probably explained to me by the doctors. I\u0026rsquo;m just parroting that.\nAnd yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s it. I get them back and now I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll for my evening.\nEVENING GF: It\u0026rsquo;s the evening. [Die clattering]\nJAM: Okay, evening roll. Five.\nGF \u0026amp; JAM: \u0026ldquo;Several bioluminescent plants and fungi are in bloom in the garden,\nGF: \u0026ldquo;making a perfect low light walking path for a promenade.\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;Do you visit? Do any of the glowing flora catch your eye?\u0026rdquo;\nGF: \u0026ldquo;Do you visit? Do any of the glowing flora catch your eye?\u0026rdquo;\nYeah, I do visit.\nJAM: Absolutely. This is I think much more Hill\u0026rsquo;s scene, especially if they, you know, have kind of a low mood on this first day.\nI should be clear: I don\u0026rsquo;t think Hill was woken up late for any particular reason. I don\u0026rsquo;t think anything went wrong. I think essentially the sort of equivalent of there was a network outage or something and the schedule got off for a day. Y\u0026rsquo;know, somebody didn\u0026rsquo;t set the clock backs for Jupiter or whatever. [Laughs]\nOr, you know, it might have even been a mistake that happened before they went into stasis where just, like, the date that they wanted to be woken up got written down wrong. Because I do think for a trip like this, people got to choose, within reason, how long they wanted to be in stasis and how long they wanted to be awake and engaging with other people, and I think a little over a week feels right for this character. Like, they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be awake the whole time, but they did want an adjustment period before they arrived.\nAnd this evening prompt, \u0026ldquo;the bioluminescent plants and fungi in the garden,\u0026rdquo; is definitely more of a quiet and reflective space that they would want to go and see.\nAnd I think they\u0026rsquo;re just walking through and I don\u0026rsquo;t know if anything particular catches their eye. I think they\u0026rsquo;re just looking at everything and in particular they\u0026rsquo;re like walking but also like, stopping and kneeling down and, like, looking very close at- at some of the fungus. And if they think it looks hardy enough and no one is looking, will reach out and touch some of them, which maybe is not strictly allowed, but is for them, like, an important part of how they understand things, um, is touching them.\nUm, and I think this is great for them because I think they had a hard day and have just been kind of moping. And being in this- this space, this like reflective space with all of this weird, glowing life, um… that is so beautiful and also, like, strange and different from what human life looks like? I\u0026rsquo;m, like, specifically thinking of- of the funguses.\nYeah, I think the fungus is what– they\u0026rsquo;re drawn towards the fungi, because if they are a puppeteer who makes the sort of strange alien-esque puppets like Big Nazo does in real life… um, I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;re in Big Nazo specifically, but I think they do make that kind of, like, large strange puppet. You know, they\u0026rsquo;re not a Sesame Street puppeteer. They are a weird, surreal, experimental puppeteer.\nAnd I think they\u0026rsquo;re feeling really inspired by the fungus, and- and it\u0026rsquo;s a nice chance for them to, like, breathe a little bit and also remember why they were excited to be here. Um, and feeling excited to meet someone- meet someone so different from themselves. And are feeling more open now to- to, like, learning and trying new things, and are excited to both… do their part of that, to do their puppets, and also to see what other people are doing. They are looking around and reminded that like everything here is so different and that\u0026rsquo;s good.\nGF: I visit the garden.\nAfter several rather ill-fated sort of intergalactic missions where the space agencies, the United Space Agencies of Earth sent people up without gardens, what they realised was that… you need contact with living things to survive and not just other people. You need contact with other living things to survive. You need…\nIn the early t– in the 21st century… [Laughing] in the 21st century, one of the th– one of the insults that people would hurl at each other was that, you know, when someone was acting too online, for example, you could say to them, \u0026ldquo;You need to go outside and touch grass.\u0026rdquo; Even though it sounds kind of silly, Terence Halbersham has been told to touch grass many times. And any time that they\u0026rsquo;re asked to touch grass, they do it.\nAnd so that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. One of the species of grass in the garden is actually bioluminescent, and when you touch this grass, it unfurls in a beautiful kind of, um… it\u0026rsquo;s not unlike a fiddlehead in that it kind of… the tip of the grass unfurls into a really gorgeous kind of, um, tendril. The tendril glows green and red… green and red… green… orange… red…\nI try and make sure to touch grass at least once a day.\nAfter I do that, I head back to my cabin.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Thirteen. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a non-denominational holiday mixer being held in the many recreation rooms of the Library Block. You don\u0026rsquo;t know anyone there. Do you attend? Do you stay? Do you mix and/or mingle?\u0026rdquo; Ooh.\nI think I try.\nI mean… I don\u0026rsquo;t know anyone there. That\u0026rsquo;s true. I don\u0026rsquo;t really know anyone, which makes me think… I don\u0026rsquo;t think I don\u0026rsquo;t have any friends or family on this, but I think that they are all still asleep and they will be kept asleep for– until, like, I was supposed to be woken up, which is, like, at the end of the trip.\nBut- so- so I attend, thinking I\u0026rsquo;ll try and meet people after being kind of sad at breakfast, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s just… I\u0026rsquo;m just tired. It\u0026rsquo;s just kind of exhausting. And for whatever reason, nobody is kind of making the connection and taking the opportunity to talk with me. They\u0026rsquo;re all, like, going into their sort of traditions and I\u0026rsquo;m just feeling a little bit lost and I don\u0026rsquo;t really know how to break that seal.\nAnd so… I leave. I am there for, like, ten minutes and then just head back to my bunk.\nDEAD OF NIGHT JAM: So the last roll of the day is dead of night. I got a ten. \u0026ldquo;The fusion reactor shut down temporarily for routine maintenance. The ship\u0026rsquo;s black hole drive supplies emergency power. Strange happenings occur around the ship. What unearthly things do you see and where?\u0026rdquo;\nOkay. I\u0026rsquo;ve been speaking about Hill in third person and I- I may want to switch to first person. Just because the game is addressing me in second person. It\u0026rsquo;s not saying \u0026ldquo;your character,\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s saying \u0026ldquo;you,\u0026rdquo; um, and I maybe want to get more into that headspace for the next several days, um.\nSo \u0026ldquo;strange happenings occur around the ship\u0026rdquo; because we\u0026rsquo;re on emergency power. \u0026ldquo;What unearthly things do you see and where?\u0026rdquo;\nUm– yeah. I mean… I think maybe it starts– I guess it is the dead of night, but I think I– I stay pretty late in the garden just, like, exploring the plants and fungus and getting really close up. Like, maybe even taking out a little notebook and taking notes of little details I might want to incorporate into puppets or projects in the future.\nAnd, um, I think I am there late and that\u0026rsquo;s maybe when the power switches. And I think I don\u0026rsquo;t notice at first because it\u0026rsquo;s dark in there, since all of the light is being provided by the bioluminescent plants, there\u0026rsquo;s no electrically powered lights in the garden at that time. And so I think maybe the first strange thing that I see is in there.\nAnd I want to say it\u0026rsquo;s like a silhouette. It is a person made of nothing. It is not a shadow. It\u0026rsquo;s not a figure. It is just the silhouette. It is just the absence of matter, but in the shape of a person or a being.\nAnd I think I don\u0026rsquo;t know that the maintenance is happening. And so I don\u0026rsquo;t know that we\u0026rsquo;re on backup power. And so I don\u0026rsquo;t know that this is going to be happening. And I think maybe the feeling, seeing it, like… is… weirdly positive? Um, I think, y\u0026rsquo;know– it sounds like a night terror demon, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s probably how some people on the ship are experiencing similar occurrences. But I think for me, it just feels like part of this sort of revelation that I\u0026rsquo;m having in the garden, um that– after spending the whole day feeling like I missed out on connecting with the familiar things that brought me comfort, that I\u0026rsquo;m in now experiencing the unfamiliar and maybe even risky and dangerous things, um, but finding inspiration and excitement in that.\nAnd so I think there is a moment where I see that silhouette and just feel my heart swell because my brain interprets it as, \u0026ldquo;Oh, they\u0026rsquo;re here. They got here early.\u0026rdquo; And then I think it flickers away and it\u0026rsquo;s more like, oh, maybe I– maybe this is a side effect of waking up. Maybe I touched the wrong mushroom too many times.\u0026rdquo;\nI think maybe– I don\u0026rsquo;t think that it was a hallucination based on the light. I think I know that it was actually there. That is maybe what makes me realise how late it has become and that I should– even though my sleep schedule is surely all fucked up from being in stasis, that I should go back to my chamber and at least try to lie down and get some rest.\nAnd I think on the way back there, I may also see some similar things in the halls. And not all of them are in the shape of people, but it is that same kind of like just silhouette, just that- that weird absence. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I see another person-shaped silhouette, but I think I see maybe some of the plants that I just saw, but, like, replicated in the hallway. and other things from around the ship. The waffle maker or the ice cream machine or, you know, just a window or a chair or– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s shapes from within the ship being projected to different places.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s when I maybe put the pieces together that this is– you know. We would have been prepped on this kind of thing before takeoff so that we didn\u0026rsquo;t panic when it happened. But. I realise that there is an explanation for what I saw. But- but am still going to bed with that feeling of– that it was still meaningful for it to have happened the way that it did, and feeling both excited and- and comforted in a way.\nGF: It is now… the dead of night. [Die clattering] \u0026ldquo;All of the isolation suites are empty. Feel free to use one.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t actually think I want to use an isolation suite. As much as I… I\u0026rsquo;m quite amenable to sensory isolation, but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel peopled out yet. So I\u0026rsquo;m not going to use the isolation booth. So instead, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go back to my bunk and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go to sleep.\nSATAH: Roll for the dead of night event. [Die clattering, hums a little tune] A six! This is from… midnight to… six am. So yeah, very much in the middle of the night, great. And a six is, \u0026ldquo;Your favorite major metropolitan center is being rendered in the pan-civic simulator, but no one is present. Will you go explore the empty simulated city? Will you be alone?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the pan-civic simulator– scrolling down there: \u0026ldquo;The simulator is a civic counterpart to the arboretum in that it replicates any location created by humanity, from major metropolitan cities to remote villages. The simulator contains all the same interactive features and safety measures as the arboretum,\u0026rdquo; which are that… \u0026ldquo;Everything can be interacted with. Water will soak clothes, but dry instantly. Fire and electricity will feel warm, but won\u0026rsquo;t burn. Anything ingestible will taste and smell real and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have adverse effects.\u0026rdquo; And \u0026ldquo;there will not be unprovoked attacks.\u0026rdquo; And in fact, they will, anybody… any violence will make the potential target disappear. If I were to attack.\nOkay. Favourite metropolitan center. And why isn\u0026rsquo;t anyone there? [Chuckles] Oh, I mean, they\u0026rsquo;re all at the holiday party, right?\nYeah, this is difficult. I think… mostly the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m struggling with here is, like… with the new neighbours departure, right– that we\u0026rsquo;re going off to participate in a cultural exchange. It isn\u0026rsquo;t clear to me that going home wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be an option?\nI guess it makes sense that maybe… I\u0026rsquo;m part of a group that is being sent explicitly to live here. Like, almost- almost forming an embassy type thing, you know? Or we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re sending people to each other\u0026rsquo;s planets to… settle in and, like, have open borders and whatever. And I need– I\u0026rsquo;m part of a group that is like, we\u0026rsquo;ve been invited to be- to establish habitats that are amenable to the continued life of human beings.\nAnd so yeah, this is- this is a city that I\u0026rsquo;m unlikely to go back to. And I think, like, I– I chose to leave. That makes sense to me just with the setup of- of what we\u0026rsquo;ve got going on. And so I think I go and wander around, and I think that it\u0026rsquo;s going to provoke nostalgia in me, but instead I just kind of turn corners and realise like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m already a ghost here.\u0026rdquo; Like, this already- this already isn\u0026rsquo;t my home anymore.\nAnd- and so I do– I explore a little bit– probably wander to stand outside of my apartment building and stare up at it. And I\u0026rsquo;m unsure whether, like– if I went in, what would it look like? Would it be my apartment? Or– when- when was this created? Would it be the people– would it look like the place before I moved in? Would it look like the place after I moved out?\nBut no one else is really there \u0026lsquo;cause they\u0026rsquo;re all at the holiday party, and the people who would know this place, my like friends… I think- I think just friends. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I have any, like, family or very close connections here. Just thinking of, like, packing up and leaving. It\u0026rsquo;s, like, me and a few friends who all just kind of went through this, like, major life events at the same time and were like, should we fucking go to Mars? [Laughing]\nThey\u0026rsquo;d all know. But they\u0026rsquo;re all still asleep. They\u0026rsquo;re all in stasis. So I walk around for a little bit. And then– on the way back from the party, I think. I go to the- I go to the party quite late, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like it. I see this on the way back. And then I go to bed.\nJAM: That was an exciting first day, I think. For me as a player, and for Hill. But okay, I will see you on day two.\nGF: In a thousand years from now, people are still going to be having a little nap after having their little mashed potatoes. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s great.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. To find where you can find the show, check out foliopod.carrd.co.

Remember: we take care of us.\nThis is episode two of our games of Immanence, a game on a colony ship a thousand years in the future about \u0026ldquo;exploring our individual and collective relationships with Earth, each other, ourselves, and the greater universe\u0026rdquo; by Marcus Hoes. With me again are Jam Edwards, who would like to remind you to touch a physical object during trying times, and garbageface aka gnostic front aka Karol Orzechowski, who would like to remind you to support DIY music, support DIY spaces, and do what you can to look out for each other.\nLast week we established that all three of our passengers, incredibly, have woken out of stasis on a journey to an intergalactic cultural exchange, and we saw their first day on the ship. After a brief… not quite as brief as it probably could have been… game philosophy rant from me– I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry– we will see the next couple days of their trips.\nGAME: DAY TWO SATAH: This could totally be me. Just my… predilections, as it were, and also the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m probably hungry, honestly. But it\u0026rsquo;s interesting that… this game, I think, in part, is meant to evoke some amount of a- a utopic vision? It says at the end that the world of Immanence is meant to be “an optimistic prediction of what our own might look like a thousand years from now,” and that it\u0026rsquo;s very much meant to be playing in the space of the destruction of- of capitalism and the better world that can come from that.\nAnd I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s me– because I am kind of a morose person– or if it\u0026rsquo;s the setup that I\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled into, or if it\u0026rsquo;s something inherent to the setup of, like, leaving Earth? Which I- I– think that I struggle to– even though I got one that was positive, I really struggle to see leaving Earth as a… a good sign? And I think as I say that, that\u0026rsquo;s definitely tinged by the fact that some of them are like, \u0026ldquo;You leave Earth by necessity,\u0026rdquo; and others of them are closer to choice. It’s- it’s– that\u0026rsquo;s really difficult to balance, for sure. But it\u0026rsquo;s evoking all of those things, but I find it… so melancholy. [Laughs]\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s- there\u0026rsquo;s an interesting tension there that… I think what the game is doing is really cool. I like the prompts so far, and I think the structure of it is very cool. And I- I- I- just– there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of tension there for me between… some of the stated goals and what I am experiencing emotionally as I play it, in a way that I don\u0026rsquo;t think… has to- has to strictly be a problem. I\u0026rsquo;m just very curious what crack it is that I\u0026rsquo;m falling into, sort of? Like, where it is in that vision of the world that I am just not quite landing on as I play through the game itself. I\u0026rsquo;m very curious about the… the different- the difference intents there in design, which I think is just my little editor brain popping up in like– I just love having those conversations with people when I\u0026rsquo;m working with them of like, what is it you mean by the things that you\u0026rsquo;re doing? Are these tensions on purpose? Or are they not on purpose, but you enjoy them? Or what can you add to the player experience that makes it more likely that their vision of the world will– not of the world, but of the game– will align with yours?\nAnd all of that said, I like what the game is? So I don\u0026rsquo;t– I really don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s an issue, but it is a curiosity for me, I guess- I guess is the best way for me to say that.\nAnd all that said, again, I could just need to eat some lunch. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do that after rolling these– these four die.\nMORNING SATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens to me this morning. [Die clattering] On day two.\nGF: It\u0026rsquo;s the morning.\nJAM: For day two! Let\u0026rsquo;s see what Hill is up to– what I am up to, as I get back into that headspace of being Hill.\nGF: Gonna roll a morning prompt. \u0026ldquo;The pedestrian track around the gymnasium block is set to morning mode. Birds are chirping, a simulated sun is shining, the sounds of a babbling brook project from afar. Do you partake?\u0026rdquo;\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to twist Terrence Halbersham\u0026rsquo;s arm to take a walk around the- the pedestrian track. Take in some simulated sun, and… I\u0026rsquo;m going to assume that these birds are simulated. If not, I hope they\u0026rsquo;re doing all right up there in space.\nOne of the things that the United Space Agencies of Earth realised in sending people up so many times was that they miss the things that they have back home. They miss things like the sun shining and the birds chirping and even just being able to take a walk. One of the things that they decided to do was to provide- begin to provide these things in a simulated way, and the concern and the reason that they didn\u0026rsquo;t do this in the beginning, apart from just, you know, straight up, you know, efficiency\u0026rsquo;s sake was that they were under the impression that if they did something like this, it would result in a sort of piercing the veil and actually be much more difficult for people to handle. They thought that the fakeness of those things would actually depress people further. But what they found was the opposite. It was that people actually really want these things so badly that they will take a fake version, a simulated version, when the real one isn\u0026rsquo;t available.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m walking around the track, the birds are chirping. I hear a peacock, which is very funny. The peacocks have a really funny [Shockingly good peacock impression] kind of sound to them. And I also hear some crows. And although the sound of crows isn\u0026rsquo;t usually, you know, very- very nice for most people, I find it– I find it soothing. The sound of a crow is the sound of the circle of life.\nSATAH \u0026amp; JAM: \u0026ldquo;Another passenger steps out of a VR suite, leaving it vacant\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;and in a single-seat concert hall configuration.\u0026rdquo; A single-seat concert hall configuration.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Do you use it or what do you listen to if you do?\u0026rdquo;\nMy first thought there is that this is fascinating to me because I have never been to an event like that. I think– I\u0026rsquo;ve been to, you know, bars when bands were playing, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never been to a big concert hall. And I think I\u0026rsquo;ll go all in and have it be like there\u0026rsquo;s a- there\u0026rsquo;s an orchestra. There\u0026rsquo;s a full orchestra, and that is certainly something that I\u0026rsquo;ve never experienced. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably barely even heard orchestral music.\nSo kind of hesitantly, I step in just to see what that\u0026rsquo;s like? And it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful. I\u0026rsquo;m– I think that I stay in there until the time runs out. I imagine that these are like programs that run for a certain specific amount of time. And I kind of stumble out in that, like, wonderful haze of just having seen a live performance that is so much bigger than me, that is this big group of people doing something together.\nYeah.\nJAM: Hill is curious and peeks in. I think they have not interacted with the VR stuff much since getting on the ship. You know, it was part of orientation and whatever. But obviously they just woke up yesterday, and, uh, I think Hill is more curious about what this says about the last person who is using it and curious about what they were listening to. And maybe will even– they see– yeah. They saw this person stepping out of the VR suite. Might follow that person instead and chat with them about what they were listening to.\nDo I want to play that out at all? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. I think they probably catch up with the person who was just using it, and, um… Hill is unfamiliar with the musical act that they were listening to and so doesn\u0026rsquo;t gather that much information, um but. Just starting- starting off this morning in a- in a curious mood.\nAFTERNOON GF: It\u0026rsquo;s the afternoon of day two. [Die clattering]\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Afternoon. I got a one.\nGF: \u0026ldquo;The library is hosting a reading…\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;The library is hosting a reading of your favorite short written piece\nGF: \u0026ldquo;of my favorite short written piece\nSATAH \u0026amp; GF: \u0026ldquo;featuring a realistic hologram of the author.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Do you attend?\nSATAH \u0026amp; GF: \u0026ldquo;Who is the author\nGF: \u0026ldquo;and what do they read?\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m fascinated by how much of this is recreating Earth when it seems like we have a- a pretty functioning Earth that we chose to leave. I guess if we\u0026rsquo;re doing a cultural exchange, it makes some amount of sense that we are bringing this kind of thing to this alien gathering. Like, being like, \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s some of the stuff we make. What kind of stuff do you make?\u0026rdquo;\nI think I go for the reading. But at some point it turns into a Q \u0026amp; A session with this hologram. and that makes me deeply uncomfortable and I leave.\n\u0026ldquo;Who is the author? What do they read?\u0026rdquo;\nGF: One of my favorite stories that I\u0026rsquo;ve that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read is written by someone named Lady… Lady Macy Moon. And she wrote just a very affecting story about a day in the life of a rock.\nSATAH: So if this is somebody who avoided… or, not strictly avoided, but who didn\u0026rsquo;t happen to be very in touch with cultural events, to the extent that they\u0026rsquo;ve never been in a concert hall, I\u0026rsquo;m very curious what would appeal to them. It- it- it– there\u0026rsquo;s nothing really to stop it from being poetry or fiction. You can- you can be really into that kind of thing and not into live music, but it does feel a little less likely, which makes me wonder if… it is… a- a- a- an essay? An essay or some sort of academic work?\nGF: I am a rock. I am a rock.\nSATAH: Yeah, I like– I like the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s an author reading one of their papers. And what- what\u0026rsquo;s– what\u0026rsquo;s the topic? This maybe could be part of what my deal is.\nSome of the easiest… like, the first thoughts are… biology and plants, anything to do with the sustaining of a human body, but also a– like, climate or growth. Those are- those are really possible and could be interesting.\nI\u0026rsquo;m drawn towards agriculture. And this- this is an author whose work I respect quite a bit. I think we were probably, uh, pen pals while I was in school. They weren\u0026rsquo;t, like, directly one of my teachers, but I read quite a lot of their work and was influenced by them.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s… it\u0026rsquo;s plant communication, I think, is what I want it to be. It\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s– this particular piece, and I think a lot of the ways that– a lot of the things that this particular academic was very focused on are the ways that plants quote unquote \u0026ldquo;talk to each other,\u0026rdquo; uh… and even the ways that they communicate to animals. The ways that that sort of collaboration can happen of, like, you know, \u0026ldquo;Eat this and then you\u0026rsquo;re going to spread the seeds when it passes through you.\u0026rdquo; Interpreting that as a form of communication and collaboration and looking at it very much through that lens is something that I find very fascinating and that this person writes about a lot.\nGF: I am a rock. It\u0026rsquo;s strange, you know, this business of being a rock. You\u0026rsquo;d think that by being something so unmoving, life would be dull, but it\u0026rsquo;s not. There\u0026rsquo;s a subtlety to existence that only the stillness of rocks can appreciate.\nSATAH: But I do leave when the Q\u0026amp;A starts because… it makes me uncomfortable that they, uh, essentially… this is a person that I\u0026rsquo;ve had conversations with and so I can feel in it like, \u0026ldquo;oh, this isn\u0026rsquo;t quite right. This isn\u0026rsquo;t, like, really how they talk and you are– all of this– there are limits to what a– the algorithm inside even a realistic hologram can do. And so you\u0026rsquo;re basing this off of this person\u0026rsquo;s existing knowledge, but what you can\u0026rsquo;t do is mimic the way– program the way that they would seek new knowledge through conversation. And so the back and forth just kind of bums me out. Uh.\nI grab one of the books, I think, you know? Take out one of the books to read a little and spend some time and head out.\nGF: To be a rock is to witness the passing of time. And perhaps that is enough.\nJAM: Let\u0026rsquo;s roll for the afternoon. Eighteen. \u0026ldquo;The entire history of one Earth subculture is on exhibit in the museum block. What subculture is it? Do you attend? How did that subculture change between the years 2020 and 3020?\u0026rdquo;\nUm, boy, wow. I\u0026rsquo;m going to scroll down to the appendix because I- I know museum block was in that appendix of other locations. So \u0026ldquo;the museum block: a wing dedicated to the entirety of Earth\u0026rsquo;s history from broad sciences to niche cultures. All inanimate artifacts are via replicas and can be interacted with and all animals are artificially intelligent holograms. Specialty exhibits cycle quarterly.\u0026rdquo;\nUm, hm… I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m in the position of either picking a subculture that I\u0026rsquo;m, like, a part of or have interacted with, which feels very like boring to me– or, you know, feels– feels very like self-centered to be like, yes, they\u0026rsquo;re displaying my thing that I like. Um, or speculating about how a subculture that I have interacted with has changed over a thousand years, which I don\u0026rsquo;t feel qualified to do. I mean– I don\u0026rsquo;t, you know, feel qualified to speculate on how a subculture that I\u0026rsquo;m in has changed in that amount of time.\nBut I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s not the point, um.\nHm. Is this a subculture that still exists? Is the question coming to me.\nOh, I think it\u0026rsquo;s soccer. I think that\u0026rsquo;s one that, um– I was trying to think like, if- if we\u0026rsquo;re going to meet aliens, it feels like something super niche would not be what\u0026rsquo;s on display right now. It feels like something that feels much more broadly understandable, even if people are not, you know, part of it. And something that represents something broadly true about humanity and Earth would be what would be on the sort of display cycle right now, what would be being highlighted as we\u0026rsquo;re entering the last week of this journey.\nSo I picked soccer. Um, or football, depending on where you are in the world. Um– maybe it is not even just soccer, but sort of sport in general, and soccer is like the lens they are using to talk about like, \u0026ldquo;This is a thing that humans do where we make up rules for fun.\u0026rdquo;\nI– I had thought it would be very silly to do, like, tabletop gaming as the subculture, um, and so I didn\u0026rsquo;t do that, but I did do, \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s how humans made up rules for themselves to follow for fun.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did this subculture change in the thousand years?\u0026rdquo; Oh my gosh. In a utopian society? Um, I mean, capitalism failed at some point in the last thousand years, and so, uh… sports certainly got- got disentangled from a lot of the things that make it exploitative and- and bad.\nAnd I think it went like– there\u0026rsquo;s certainly exhibits about like these big international games, and then there\u0026rsquo;s maybe a fallow period for- for sports and some documentation about, like, very small leagues that got started up and failed in, like, troubled years after capitalism failed but before, um, we sort of rebuilt a better society. People made very, very localized teams, um, and as things got more stable, that very localized sports culture became the sort of default. Like, um, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to expand this into an international spectacle necessarily. It\u0026rsquo;s not so much rooting for your national team, it\u0026rsquo;s rooting for your neighbourhood team, and still feeling that sense of bonding with other people close to you and far from you. Meeting a new person from a different part of the world and talking about your local teams and what you like about them and the players and the… the culture shifted to sort of a hyperlocal culture, but one that, because it had been so international before, exists everywhere, and is still this thing that you can hop into a game in a new place that you\u0026rsquo;re visiting and still feel very at home and excited for it.\nAnd, like, soccer is the one that really survives, I think, is what I\u0026rsquo;m assuming here. Like, other sports are still getting played. I think… I think American football, um, never fully recovers. [Laughing] Um, because of a lot of reasons. How dangerous it is and how exploitative it was for so long… uh, not that soccer isn\u0026rsquo;t, but– okay, no, this is enough sports. This is not a sports podcast.\nThat is what\u0026rsquo;s on the Museum Block exhibit. And I think Hill is curious about it and spends a little bit of time looking, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and roll for evening now.\nEVENING GF: It\u0026rsquo;s now the evening.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Three. \u0026ldquo;The evening traffic simulator is running at the racetrack. Traffic is bumper to bumper, but you can leave whenever you like. Do you partake? What car do you replicate?\u0026rdquo;\nWhy… why do we want to replicate that part of human existence? Oh no!\nI absolutely don\u0026rsquo;t partake. I walk by it and I\u0026rsquo;m baffled, exactly as I am now. I head– I go home to read my book for the remainder of this time block.\nGF: [Die clattering] \u0026ldquo;A group of strangers is going for a night swim at the dive-in the theater in the gymnasium block and they invite you to join them. Do you tag along? What movie is on?\u0026rdquo;\nTerrence Halbersham, you may be surprised to know, is not much of a swimmer. Yes, Terrence likes to take a dip in Earth water from time to time. Who doesn\u0026rsquo;t? But Terrence\u0026rsquo;s commitment to the art of quartz painting and their commitment to their craft never left much time for the kind of dalliances that a night swim might entail.\nThat being said, the idea of the dive-in theater has always moved Terrence. And tonight– tonight the movie\u0026rsquo;s called– [Laughing] I just used a movie title generator. Tonight the movie\u0026rsquo;s called The Last Lap, colon, Waves of Destiny. Um. [Laughing]\nI joined them in the dive-in theater. I actually don\u0026rsquo;t have to swim very much. Um, swimming is rather embarrassing for me, what with my extremely lanky limbs, being– what with being such a tall person. But because I\u0026rsquo;m so tall, I actually don\u0026rsquo;t really have to swim around. I can just sort of lounge in the pool comfortably.\nAnd… what\u0026rsquo;s it called? Lap of– no. The Last Lap: Waves of Destiny.\nThe Last Lap: Waves of Destiny is about an Olympian. Hold on, let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can get some– like a water arpeggio going here.\nOh gosh, how do I describe this film? Well, it definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t a blockbuster when it came out, but one of the things that it was was a cult classic. It follows the swimming career of Oais Lam as Oais tries to become an Olympic swimmer.\nWhat makes this story remarkable from any other human person trying to become an Olympic swimmer? Well, uh, the difference between Oais and all the other Olympic swimmers is that Oais was born with a very rare condition of not having a head.\nNot having a head, um, usually would disqualify one from most… pursuits. But, um, in the year 3000, scientists were able to, uh, make the first– make the first person who had no head? No, that\u0026rsquo;s easy. We\u0026rsquo;ve been making people who have no heads for a long time. What scientists were able to do was to help a person survive with no head for longer than– longer than ten minutes. And that led to some significant advances in headless science, which then of course led to people like Oais, um, being able to, y\u0026rsquo;know, reach for their dreams of being Olympic swimmers. In this case.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not gonna– I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give the plot away because I hope that when you get to 3020, you\u0026rsquo;ll watch, uh, what\u0026rsquo;s it called… Last Lap: Waves of Destiny. And when you do that, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did when I watched it just now.\nJAM: Eighteen for evening as well. \u0026ldquo;Fireworks are being simulated in the…\u0026rdquo; Oh, I was dreading having to say this word because I don\u0026rsquo;t know how it\u0026rsquo;s pronounced. \u0026ldquo;Simulated in the… cup-oh-la? Cue-pa-la? Part of me– the very New England part of me wants to say like, cop-oh-la!! Um– \u0026ldquo;rendered visually over various skylines on the massive windows and accompanied by sound effects. Does anyone stay to watch them? How long do they stay?\u0026rdquo;\nThis is also in the appendix. \u0026ldquo;The crow\u0026rsquo;s nest cupola: a large observation deck at the top of the ship.\u0026rdquo; Um… that\u0026rsquo;s so interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s been a thousand years. I wonder… I assume at this point all fireworks on Earth for the most part are simulated also, so I think it\u0026rsquo;s… oh, it\u0026rsquo;s being rendered visually over various skylines. I think the skylines are a bigger draw than the fireworks themselves, because I imagine they\u0026rsquo;re pretty similar to fireworks that you would see on Earth.\nI\u0026rsquo;m curious if the sound effects are like what fireworks sound like now or if they… I have to imagine they would modify them slightly so that they\u0026rsquo;re not so loud. I understand that\u0026rsquo;s part of the appeal for some people, but it also causes some problems. Um.\nI do think the skylines are the bigger draw. That, uh, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a group of folks up there, um, trying to guess which- which city it is. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s probably both, like, contemporary and historical skylines being projected. And so I think this probably maybe happens fairly regularly, um, and so there are- are groups of folks who have gathered and are treating it sort of like a trivia night at this point. Uh, yeah.\nThe question is phrased in the plural. \u0026ldquo;Does anyone stay to watch them? How long do they stay?\u0026rdquo; And I wonder if that\u0026rsquo;s phrased with having a party with multiple people in mind? Am I in the wrong part of the document… um, for a multiplayer game or a solo game? Yep, totally. Nope. I was in the wrong part of the doc. Cool. Yeah. The question is, \u0026ldquo;Do you watch them? How long do you stay?\u0026rdquo;\nI think Hill notices, definitely, the people who are treating them as trivia and is interested in that, and yeah, I think is like, \u0026ldquo;This is pretty,\u0026rdquo; you know, \u0026ldquo;This is nice. I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen fireworks in a while.\u0026rdquo; But is– ends up being more tuned in to the folks who are, like, pointing at, like, the not-firework part of the projection, at the skyline part and- and getting very animated when it- when changes.\nDo they go over and talk to them? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. I think… yeah, the interaction with the person who came out of VR this morning didn\u0026rsquo;t really go anywhere, and so I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m feeling particularly confident about jumping into another- another social situation. But I do think I would just, like, people-watch for long enough to figure out that that\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, that they\u0026rsquo;re like identifying what city it is, and- and appreciating that. That\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nDEAD OF NIGHT GF: It\u0026rsquo;s now the dead of night. I\u0026rsquo;m going to change dies here.\nSATAH: Dead of night, rolled a five. And again, that\u0026rsquo;s that same prompt. That\u0026rsquo;s the major metropolitan center in the pan-civic simulator.\nI like the idea that I go here partially to read. Reading in my bunk is just kind of like not working because it\u0026rsquo;s weird and unfamiliar and I keep getting distracted by, like, new noises and people and all that kind of thing, and I go out to look for a place and see that the city that I lived in is back- back in the pan-civic simulator.\nAnd it occurs to me that I could take this opportunity to visit a couple places in the city that I never had the opportunity to go, which I think even as I think it, I\u0026rsquo;m like \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the opportunity? I lived there for this long. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t go. I could have gone any time.\u0026rdquo; But sometimes when you live somewhere, you just don\u0026rsquo;t go places. That is just kind of sometimes how it works.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t go somewhere wildly divergent, but I just go somewhere that I never particularly had a reason to go before, and I sit outside and I read my book of essays until I think that I\u0026rsquo;m ready to go to bed.\nGF: [Die clattering] I once again got, \u0026ldquo;All of the isolation suites are empty. Feel free to use one.\u0026rdquo; And once again, I\u0026rsquo;m going to skip it.\nJAM: That\u0026rsquo;s a ten for dead of night. Oh, interesting. \u0026ldquo;The fusion reactor shut down temporarily for routine maintenance. The ship\u0026rsquo;s black hole drive supplies emergency power.\u0026rdquo; This is the same prompt that we got on night one.\nAnd yeah, I mean, I guess it makes sense to me that they would shut it down for two nights in a row. They didn\u0026rsquo;t finish the maintenance last night and they\u0026rsquo;re working on it again tonight.\nAnd so… do I see anything else? I think it\u0026rsquo;s been more of a mundane day.\nYeah, again, I mean, I think it shows up right when the thing I was doing in the evening is wrapping up. So at the fireworks, those- those same sort of projections of empty silhouettes start happening, um, but in the sk– on the sort of observation screen, um, is where Hill and the rest of the people who are still hanging out there notice them. Um, which is a lot scarier, I think, than the first night\u0026rsquo;s situation, because the first thing is just a big empty– and it\u0026rsquo;s, you know, a projection of somebody\u0026rsquo;s bed or something, but from where they are, it just looks like a hole in the ship opening up. And so I think there is a little gasp when that happens from everyone who\u0026rsquo;s still hanging out in that space.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s maybe the thing that breaks the ice with Hill and this group of folks who are doing firework pub trivia night. The other folks are maybe chatting about– in the way that, you know, happens when– when you are somewhere and an alarm or siren goes off and people who don\u0026rsquo;t know each other start looking around and talking to each other and being like, \u0026ldquo;I think,\u0026rdquo; you know, either, \u0026ldquo;I think we need to go,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I think it\u0026rsquo;s OK because of these reasons.\u0026rdquo; Everyone is very startled and then it goes away and Hill remembers that that was also happening last night and makes the connection and starts chatting about, \u0026ldquo;Oh, yeah, right. They mentioned this in orientation. This is the black hole drive. Were you guys… talking about– were you guys doing trivia about which skyline it was?\u0026rdquo; And they were. And they go through which cities they got to see tonight. Yeah, so that\u0026rsquo;s nice.\nAnd then I think they are- are maybe feeling a little shaken up from that and, um– all of the folks, a little shaken up from that, and the fireworks were winding down anyway, and so they will, uh– they wil part ways. Maybe exchange bunk numbers so they can chat again if they want to meet up and do something else. But that\u0026rsquo;s it for day two.\nGAME: DAY THREE MORNING SATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s do day three.\nGF: OK. It\u0026rsquo;s day three.\nJAM: I\u0026rsquo;m in the right place in the document. I\u0026rsquo;m at the tables for one player game. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll for the morning of day three.\nSATAH \u0026amp; GF: [Dice clattering]\nSATAH: In the morning, I rolled a thirteen.\nGF: \u0026ldquo;The pedestrian track around the gymnasium block is once again set to morning mode. Birds are chirping.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Birds are chirping.\nSATAH \u0026amp; GF: \u0026ldquo;A simulated sun is shining. The sounds of a babbling brook project from afar.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Do you partake?\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t partake, per se. I think that I… am still– like, I wake up and I\u0026rsquo;m drawn towards the sun. Like, the- the- the simulated sun that is shining out of here. And I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do any particular physical exercise, but I sit and kind of half observe the people around me, half just keep reading my- my book of essays.\nProbably not for the first time. I suspect this is one I\u0026rsquo;ve read a lot, but maybe haven\u0026rsquo;t read since I was in school and am curious, like, is this going to be like the horror of returning to something you loved that was very influential to you that you now have grown beyond, or is it just going to be refreshing? And I think so far it\u0026rsquo;s refreshing, which is a relief.\nGF: For the second morning in a row, Terrence takes a lovely stroll. And today, the peacocks and the crows are replaced by wrens, blue jays, and many others that I can\u0026rsquo;t identify.\nThe simulated sun today feels especially good. They must have recalibrated the vitamin D outputs.\nJAM: Oof. Fifteen. \u0026ldquo;Another passenger, one you haven\u0026rsquo;t met, bears a striking resemblance to someone you\u0026rsquo;ve been missing. Who do they look like? Are they on this ship or another? Did they make it off Earth at all?\u0026rdquo; Oh, I see– is the person I\u0026rsquo;ve been missing on this ship or another ship? Did they make it off Earth at all?\nHuh! That\u0026rsquo;s an interesting prompt for this scenario where it is a voluntary mission, or at least like a non-emergency mission where we\u0026rsquo;re going to meet new neighbors. This- this could be a much heavier- heavier set of questions if this was an evacuation of Earth.\nYeah, I think the next… so this day three at breakfast– Hill met folks during orientation and training in the weeks leading up to the launch, but really only knows well enough to sit and have a meal with, um, the other member of their puppeteering troop that they came with. Who I think has been… oh. Are they awake or are they still in stasis? Oh, I think they\u0026rsquo;re still in stasis. I think they selected, like– they were very excited for the destination and not the journey. Um, that that person wanted very much to wake up as late as possible. So I think is not scheduled to wake up until one or two days before arrival at Saturn.\nYeah, so I mean… maybe that\u0026rsquo;s who it is that this person looks like. I was going to say, yeah, I think at breakfast Hill catches the eye of the skyline trivia people from the previous night and- and goes over to maybe, uh, maybe sit with them. I think they\u0026rsquo;ve been mostly taking meals alone. And one of the folks that they\u0026rsquo;re with, Hill for a moment thinks– oh, I should name this person.\nUm, River is the name of the other puppeteer, the performer who is still in stasis.\nAnd yeah, this person who is sitting with the skyline folks at first, Hill\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, River\u0026rsquo;s up! River\u0026rsquo;s awake.\u0026rdquo; But like, no, it is just like a person with a very similar hairstyle and maybe, like, very similar glasses frames, and, uh, yeah, they get that like momentary shock of like, \u0026ldquo;My friend!\u0026rdquo; and then realise that it is just a different person.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s interesting. Yeah, not as heavy as it could have been, as I said, but definitely told us a little bit more about Hill and the circumstances that they are in.\nAFTERNOON GF: It\u0026rsquo;s the afternoon.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] My afternoon roll is a seven.\nGF: [Die rolling] \u0026ldquo;A stranger is alone in the engine room, crying in the ambient light of the fusion reactor.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;If you ask them what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, they will say nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nGF: \u0026ldquo;If you ask them what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, they will say nothing.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Do you say anything?\u0026rdquo;\nGF: \u0026ldquo;Do you say anything?\nSATAH \u0026amp; GF: \u0026ldquo;Do you acknowledge them at all?\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Why do you think they\u0026rsquo;re upset?\u0026rdquo;\nGF: \u0026ldquo;Why do you think they\u0026rsquo;re upset?\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: I like the idea that this is another person who was woken up at the same time as me. I think that that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a thing that, like– people are starting to get it. This is day three. We\u0026rsquo;ve all been sort of wandering around and again, everybody has different levels of effects, but I think that all of us are feeling a slight amount of isolation. Because– sort of out of a coincidence of numbers and layout, everybody who woke up– who was woken up in this process, doesn\u0026rsquo;t know anybody else who was woken up. Probably a few of them know people who were already up and they\u0026rsquo;ve been able to, like, kind of integrate themselves a little bit, but it still feels weird and unexpected.\nAnd this this is- this is one of those people. And so they\u0026rsquo;re just– they say that nothing\u0026rsquo;s wrong! And I\u0026rsquo;m like, okay.\nAnd I think out of a, like– almost a sense of desperation, but also genuine curiosity and, like, maybe this person doesn\u0026rsquo;t want this, but like maybe they\u0026rsquo;re– maybe they just– they don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, but they want to talk. And I ask like, \u0026ldquo;What are you doing down here? Like, is this– do you know how this thing works?\u0026rdquo; And, like, gesture. And they sort of, like, nod tearfully and snottily.\nAnd I think I end up getting the sense of what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, which is something to do with… being scared that they\u0026rsquo;re under qualified? Like… they came into the engine room in part to sort of up their confidence. Like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to walk in there. I\u0026rsquo;m going to know everything that\u0026rsquo;s going on. This is part of my job.\u0026rdquo; And then everything in there was just unfamiliar enough that they had a crisis of confidence. And they don\u0026rsquo;t explicitly say that, but it\u0026rsquo;s just obvious from the way that they\u0026rsquo;re talking.\nAnd then I think, without really meaning to, I make them feel better because… I don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about. And I just ask questions and they are able to answer all of them. And slowly but surely over the course of our conversation– I have this very strong intellectual curiosity, right? I like to learn stuff. But I– I just have no– I have almost no context for almost, like– for any of their work. And so I\u0026rsquo;m asking a bunch of, like, very simple questions and then getting a little bit more complicated because I\u0026rsquo;m able to make connections and that kind of thing. And they\u0026rsquo;re able to explain a bunch of stuff.\nAnd through that conversation, they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I was holding myself to a kind of impossible standard or an unrealistic standard.\u0026rdquo; Like, \u0026ldquo;I might not be the foremost expert in my field, but I am actually very good at this,\u0026rdquo; which can be hard to remember when you are largely surrounded by other experts. But then when you contrast yourself against a lay person, you\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh! I have forgotten more than you\u0026rsquo;ll ever know. Right!\u0026rdquo; And I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;re shitty about it in the way that that phrase sounds– they\u0026rsquo;re genuinely excited and they\u0026rsquo;re excited to try and explain a bunch of this stuff to me.\nAnd I think, one small detail, I love the idea that, like, they are a terrible science communicator. They are genuinely very good at this, but the conversation, like– I am struggling to grasp these concepts because they are pretty terrible at actually breaking this stuff down for a lay person. And luckily I\u0026rsquo;m patient and I\u0026rsquo;m kind of used to that from my own academic career, having to push past that. But… it\u0026rsquo;s definitely– there\u0026rsquo;s- there\u0026rsquo;s a certain amount of me accepting, \u0026ldquo;Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m not- I\u0026rsquo;m probably not going to walk out of this with a full understanding of what\u0026rsquo;s going on, because that\u0026rsquo;s not what this person is good at. This person is good at doing this thing, but not explaining this thing.\u0026rdquo;\nGF: I notice this person crying in the- in the light of the fusion reactor and- and I ask them what\u0026rsquo;s wrong and they say, \u0026ldquo;Nothing.\u0026rdquo; I ask them if they would like for me to sit with them for a while and they say, \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; So we sit in silence. And after a while, I reach my hand over and offer it to them and I hold their hand for the rest of the afternoon.\nJAM: So let\u0026rsquo;s roll for afternoon on day three. A twenty. Oh, \u0026ldquo;your favorite major city is being simulated in the pan-civic simulator. What city is it? What time period?\u0026rdquo; Oh my gosh. Oh boy. Mmhmm. Yeah. [Giggles] I need to speculate about what cities still exist and what they\u0026rsquo;re like.\nUm, I do think that Hill is like invited to this by the skyline people who, like, of course– I think some of them are architects and some of them are, um– there might be a few, like, tech people. There might be a few engineers who are like crew members of the ship, um, who during their- their downtime, uh, hang out with these folks. This is a- a not quite an official, like, \u0026ldquo;architecture appreciation club,\u0026rdquo; but you know, folks who have bonded over, um, liking buildings. [Laughs]\nUm, and that is maybe the, um– the person who looks like River is an engineer on the ship, which is why Hill didn\u0026rsquo;t encounter them during the training, because they have done these kinds of missions before and- and were, you know, on a different orientation track.\nSo Hill\u0026rsquo;s favorite major city is being simulated. I- I mean, I think about cities that I\u0026rsquo;ve been to… I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s Providence. Um, you know? Maybe it is… yeah, I think it is. I, you know, I was- I was tempted to say that it was, um, somewhere more historically significant. Um, you know, I was going to say maybe it is Berlin; maybe they are like simulating the– the fall of the Berlin wall.\nUm, and, uh– I think this is all conversation, maybe, that\u0026rsquo;s being had over, over breakfast beforehand. They\u0026rsquo;re talking about other simulated cities that have been featured throughout the trip \u0026lsquo;cause a lot of these folks have been awake the whole time and definitely the- the one person who looks like River, who is, um, part of the crew of the ship. And yeah, they\u0026rsquo;re talking about, \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, we did, you know, we did Berlin, we did, uh, London, we did Hong Kong, we did Mumbai, we did a bunch of different cities,\u0026rdquo; and talking about highlights of different cities and- and, um, different time periods that- that they went through. I imagine that they, like, would project not just one time period per day, um, but like, you know, for, for this part of the day, it\u0026rsquo;s Edo period Japan, and then it\u0026rsquo;s Tokyo circa 1995. And then it\u0026rsquo;s… yeah.\nI think– I think it\u0026rsquo;s gotta be… favourite city. Yeah. If it\u0026rsquo;s your favourite city, I think it\u0026rsquo;s Providence. Um, and it\u0026rsquo;s very possible that in like the last thousand years, Providence has grown and changed a lot. It is, like, pretty close to both Boston and New York, two pretty major East coast cities, and… gosh, I can\u0026rsquo;t, I can\u0026rsquo;t stop myself from thinking, like… the ocean level did rise, um, and so like the people who were living on the coast in- in New England and on the East coast moved- moved inland, and so, like, the population of Providence got a lot bigger very rapidly.\nUm, and I think also the- the time period, it moves through, like, pre-colonial era and the Indigenous people- the Narragansett people living there. And then I think there\u0026rsquo;s one segment of the day that\u0026rsquo;s very focused on, like, university life and, like, Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design. And um, there\u0026rsquo;s gotta be like a post collapse period, um, which also like– there is a– the- the Providence river that runs through, like, downtown Providence, like– that rising, and probably some of the city getting destroyed, and the parts that are uphill from the river growing and changing.\nUm, the skyline folks are– you know, let Hill know that this is happening today. I think it comes up in conversation when they\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, where are you from on Earth? Um, and they\u0026rsquo;re talking about Providence and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s scheduled for the- the pan-civic simulator today!\u0026rdquo; Um, and they head over and um…\nYou know, I think as I\u0026rsquo;m talking about it, I think I probably have mixed feelings about visiting a fake version. I think I\u0026rsquo;m initially, like, very excited and- and, like– particularly to, like, show these new people around \u0026lsquo;cause I think probably, um, at least some of them have never been. Um, it is maybe a larger city than it was in- in the 20th and 21st century, but it\u0026rsquo;s still not, like, an international hub the way that New York is.\nAnd yeah, I think that initial excitement then is like tampered a little bit by, like, moving through the different periods, and so none of it is the city that Hill actually knows. And I think they maybe realise that this is, you know– this is not designed to be a little slice of home. This is designed to be a historical artifact that we\u0026rsquo;re sharing with each other and with these new folks that we\u0026rsquo;re meeting, um, which they can appreciate, but, um, it was sort of the feeling of like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m going to show them my favourite park,\u0026rdquo; um, and they got there and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;No, that park\u0026rsquo;s not part of this time period.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, um, uh, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s the afternoon. Um, a little- a little mix of emotions there.\nEVENING SATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s see what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the evening.\nGF: It\u0026rsquo;s the evening. [Die rolling] \u0026ldquo;The choral karaoke club is setting up in the theater block and they seem to be devoting the night to one of my favourite musical acts. Who is the artist or band? Do you attend? Do you sing along?\u0026rdquo;\nOne of my favourite artists is– I have no musical ability. But one of my favourite artists of the three thousandth century– [Lauhing] no. Wait. Third- three- 24– no wait– uh, 30– 31st century is– tune in for another episode of \u0026ldquo;Karol garbageface tries to figure out what century it is.\u0026rdquo; The 31st century.\nUh, [Laughing] one of my favourite artists is, is a, is a pretty cool rapper named Ration-Al. And Ration– like, \u0026ldquo;rationale,\u0026rdquo; you know, like, uh, \u0026ldquo;What was their rationale for doing this?\u0026rdquo; Uh, but Ration-AL is spelled like \u0026ldquo;Ration\u0026rdquo; and then dash Al. Like A L. Which, you know, whatever, I think is pretty good. Ration-Al.\nUm, the- the thing about– the thing about Ration-Al is that they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re one of the fastest rappers that\u0026rsquo;s ever existed. And uh, one: I\u0026rsquo;m not able to- to rap along with their raps at all. Um, but two: one of the things that, uh– they have a lot of fans. And one of the things that they\u0026rsquo;re known for is, um, how much their fans love singing along to what they do. And now as much as I am a huge fan and as much as I- I love Ration-Al to death, um, hearing other people, uh, rap his lyrics just makes my skin crawl, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to attend, uh, the- the karaoke club. Uh, not tonight anyway.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Eleven is… oh, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a number of former professional kitchen staff among the passengers and they\u0026rsquo;re taking orders for dinner. Order anything, including nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nI think at this point… I love the idea that I\u0026rsquo;m taking this as an opportunity to– like, my stomach has settled. I\u0026rsquo;ve been good for a couple of days. And now I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Okay. Well, I gotta see what\u0026rsquo;s up with the vegetables that they\u0026rsquo;ve been growing on this ship.\u0026rdquo;\nI like the idea that this ship has been on a very, very long journey? Like, this is a generation ship that… picked us up? Basically. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons we were in stasis is that all of us were put into stasis and tossed out into space to be almost, like, a dead drop for this ship that would be happening to pass by. I think it probably takes a wide orbit of some kind, never really goes close to Earth, but it orbits doing something or other, and its orbit is wide enough that it goes by Mars, which is where we\u0026rsquo;re going. And so they pulled in this, uh– shipping crate– not literally, but kind of like that, of all of us in stasis and we are just going to be put on Mars. And I know that part of this is about what happens with the ship. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what the options are, so I\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out at the end, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that, like, we were in a ship that they just brought in and then I\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out, you know? Get there at the end.\nSo anyway. I order just, like, big ol\u0026rsquo; salad. Just whatever- whatever they\u0026rsquo;ve got going on. As- as somebody who\u0026rsquo;s worked in food service a lot, the idea that you can just order whatever sounds… [Laughing] kind of– sounds like a nightmare. So I am imagining that what that actually means is that they essentially have a set menu that they are happy to do some amount of variation on, uh, for, like– especially for, like, dietary restrictions. And if somebody really wants something, they\u0026rsquo;ll make an exception. But there is a set menu, and I just order the thing that has the most ship-grown produce on it.\nAnd I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to build a little bit more community here. I think that… the person from the engine room comes and sits with me briefly and, like, points at my book that I\u0026rsquo;m still working through and says something essentially incomprehensible– is like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that publishing company, they do a lot of really cool work. They published this one great collection by,\u0026rdquo; uh, and they cite, like, you know, an academic on nuclear fission or whatever it is that they are not– that they\u0026rsquo;re into that I didn\u0026rsquo;t totally understand. Uh, and they badly try to explain some of the concepts in the book.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh… cool… yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll…\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;You should read that!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;It sounds a little bit over my head, but. sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll- I\u0026rsquo;ll– I can… give it a try at some point.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, if you have any questions, you could just ask me!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s really– that\u0026rsquo;s really kind. Thanks.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then I think that… word gets around. Like, I was talking with… one of the cooks, or… probably there\u0026rsquo;s people who are, like, serving food, right? Um, which to be very clear– like, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go into my whole rant about this, but if we weren\u0026rsquo;t in the strictures of the capitalist structure that we all struggle in currently and also in a completely unmanaged ongoing global pandemic, I would love to still be a server. There are complications when it comes to… my body and disability and pain and that kind of thing, but I loved being a server. I love that social role. And so I happen to find it completely reasonable that there would be people on this fully automated luxury space communism vessel, as it were, as I believe it is explicitly described at one point in the book, who would choose to serve dinner to people. \u0026lsquo;Cause yeah, so would I.\nUm. And I know that that… like, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to understand they\u0026rsquo;re being cooks, right? Somebody has to make the food. But I think that it\u0026rsquo;s really easy and understandable in a lot of ways to assume that there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be servers? And maybe they get a better title. [Laughs] But… I think there are freaks like me out there who really enjoy being able to do that. And so. I like the idea that some of them exist on this vessel.\nAnd I was talking with one of them, like, about my request for the most ship-grown produce, right? Like, nothing that was brought on frozen or that they\u0026rsquo;ve picked up elsewhere or whatever, but just stuff that was grown specifically on the ship, seed to plant, all of it. Uh, and we worked together to find something. And the server told somebody that I was doing this– like went over to– there\u0026rsquo;s- there\u0026rsquo;s- there\u0026rsquo;s farmers, basically. Farmers who come over to talk with me because the server went over and was like, \u0026ldquo;Hey. That person over there with the book, uh, with the plants on the cover? Has been asking after your plants.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they come and they join me and we start talking. I think that they do it in a way that is like jokingly threatening at first, like, \u0026ldquo;I hear you\u0026rsquo;ve been asking questions about my produce.\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;m a little alarmed and they, like, laugh and soften and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, we grow it! How is it? Do you like it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s amazing. It does taste different. Why does it taste different?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we start talking about the differences in flavour that come from the different cultivation methods, but that also come from genetic splicing that they\u0026rsquo;ve done to better conserve resources on the ship. Like… a lot of plants grow in conditions with gravity, right? With Earth-like gravity. And a certain, uh, sect of plant weirdos became very much like, \u0026ldquo;Ooh. Well, maybe we could save energy on artificial gravity in some sections of farm land if we could create plants– if we could figure out a way to help them grow in less gravity.\u0026rdquo; and- and do a little bit of tinkering and see what happens. And so there are some minor changes in flavour that come from that, because, like, these are plants that were designed to be more efficiently farmed in these conditions.\nAnd yeah. We just have this big dorky conversation. I think the engineer– the person I found crying in the engineering room takes their leave at a certain point. Not in a negative way. They\u0026rsquo;re just like– they were only in here for a few minutes and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, great! I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you to it. Remember to read that book!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;O… okay, I– I promise I will try.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd yeah, just spend, spend my evening talking with these- these farmers about the food. At one point they sort of raucously, like, pull one of the cooks out of the kitchen to talk about how they deal with the textural variety of certain, like, radishes and that kind of thing.\nAnd the cook has to be like, \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, no, I had to learn– um, I mean, obviously there\u0026rsquo;s- there\u0026rsquo;s– I\u0026rsquo;m not going to bore you with–\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re all like, \u0026ldquo;Come on! Bore us!\u0026rdquo;\nUm, and just, yeah! We just talk about plants! It\u0026rsquo;s just a group of us talkin\u0026rsquo; about plants. From different angles. And that\u0026rsquo;s nice and fun. I liked– that was a fun prompt.\nThe note I took to remind myself of that was \u0026ldquo;spontaneous plant nerd convention, which feels like a note where I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll know what that means.\u0026rdquo; And I will not know what that means. Luckily I recorded it.\nJAM: Okay. Let\u0026rsquo;s roll for the evening. Oh! We\u0026rsquo;re back.\nSo I think after that– uh, I think Hill is– I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a little off. I keep switching between third and first person, but just know that I\u0026rsquo;m always talking about Hill, the character. Just trying- trying to use I.\nYeah. I\u0026rsquo;m feeling- I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a little off, um, after that, that experience this afternoon, I think, especially after having that moment of thinking that River was here, too, and- and having the sort of unexpected discordance with seeing Providence through the- the weird lens of- of an outsider. I think Hill is- is glad to be talking to a few people now, but, um, it just ended up really reminding them that they\u0026rsquo;re the only person they know really well here is not, uh, is not awake yet and, um, and they\u0026rsquo;re so far, you know, physically and emotionally from home.\nUh, and so of course, I rolled a five, and for the evening we\u0026rsquo;re back in the garden with the bioluminescent plants and fungi! Uh, yeah. Hill, I think, having such a positive experience here on- on the first night when they were feeling out of sorts, gravitates back towards- towards here and is trying not to get their hopes up about it, like, being as amazing as the first time that they went, um, but- but just needs a little bit of- of quiet time. Um.\nAnd I think this time they are thinking more about River and- and wanting, you know– noting all of the plants and fungus that, uh– plants and fungi that they saw the first time they were here and- and made them want to like make weird new puppets. Um, and this time looking at it with the thought in mind of like, you know, \u0026ldquo;I wish I could show River this, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we\u0026rsquo;re going to have time after they wake up.\u0026rdquo; Um… yeah. Maybe will take out a little notebook and start sketching some- some of the ones they want to remember, um, and that they want to share with their colleague.\nYeah, definitely having some restorative alone time, but it\u0026rsquo;s still feeling a little- feeling a little- a little more bummed out.\nDEAD OF NIGHT GF: It\u0026rsquo;s the dead of night. [Die rolling] \u0026ldquo;The insomniacs among the volunteer kitchen staff are performing uncanny acts of culinary artistry. I can order anything I\u0026rsquo;d like, including nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nYou know, there\u0026rsquo;s– there is something very magical about cooking late at night. Um, but one of– one of the ways that I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten used to, uh, galactic travel, um, is by not– is by really maintaining a really regimented eating schedule. I find that I can eat almost anything that I like, but if I eat before certain times or after certain times… um, look, let me just put it this way. Having bowel movements in space is… we all do it. We all do it. We all know what it\u0026rsquo;s like. We all know the challenges. And the easier you can make it on yourself, the better. So I don\u0026rsquo;t order anything, but I do go and hang out in the kitchen. And I just– I- I have a really lovely time just watching, uh- watching the insomniacs in the kitchen staff just chopping it up.\nBut I do turn in at a relatively reasonable hour.\nJAM: Let\u0026rsquo;s roll for the night. That is a seventeen. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s sleepaway night at the museum block. Visitors may sleep among the many exhibits in replicated tents and sleeping bags. The exhibits don\u0026rsquo;t come to life, but the other parts of the museum, like stanchions and kiosks do.\u0026rdquo; Huh. \u0026ldquo;They move around harmlessly.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m just thinking about a kiosk moving around harmlessly.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m there. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Hill is- is part of this. Um, I think maybe they spend some quiet time in the- in the garden and then are walking back to their sleeping quarters and, uh, maybe see like… [Laughing] I\u0026rsquo;m imagining there\u0026rsquo;s just bulletin boards all over the ship with activities that are coming up, um, \u0026lsquo;cause there seemed to be a lot of activities. Uh, or maybe there\u0026rsquo;s just, like, a- a fairly complex, uh, schedule, um, that everybody has a copy of. And- and either way Hill is looking at this option tonight, the sleepaway night and- and going, \u0026ldquo;No… not for me tonight. I do not want to go hang out with people and, um, moving kiosks. I want to go to bed.\u0026rdquo; And they do.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] In the dead of night… \u0026ldquo;the cryptozoologist\u0026rsquo;s club is hosting encounters with everything from cryptids to yokai in the arboretum. Will you attend? What mythological creature do you meet?\u0026rdquo; Huh!\nI think usually this is not an event that I would be interested in, but one of my new friendly acquaintances that I met at dinner– like a group of them came over and the group kind of, like, grew a little bit as like more people came in and they saw their friends and they joined and learned kind of more about what they are. Like, one of them was not a farmer, but is- is focused on… I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they\u0026rsquo;re focused on animal agriculture or just they haven\u0026rsquo;t- they know a lot about animals? And they say that everybody should come because they have been in talks with the cryptozoologists club to make their cryptids more biologically feasible. Like essentially being like, \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, of course a unicorn could just magically have a horn, yes– but. What… if we could work backwards to find out an evolutionary reason why they would have them?\u0026rdquo; That kind of thing.\nAnd– I don\u0026rsquo;t stay for long. Kind of \u0026lsquo;cause I\u0026rsquo;m just tired! Long day, meeting a lot of people. I need to get to bed. But I do come and, like, laugh a lot at this person\u0026rsquo;s alternate outrage and joy as the cryptozoologists introduce these mythological creatures.\nAnd I think that there\u0026rsquo;s probably, like, a- a very friendly, familiar antagonism between them? Like, the cryptozoologists showing, uh, you know, Nessie. And this animal expert shouting like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have gills? Interesting. How does she breathe underwater?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the cryptozoologists, like, exaggeratedly roll their eyes or smile. And one of them is like, \u0026ldquo;Magic.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then another one parrots an explanation, like– is like– \u0026ldquo;Well, actually! It\u0026rsquo;s very similar to whales and how they have to raise up to bring in oxygen and then go below.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd this– I think that the person that I came with is, like, delighted to be countered in a sort of scientific debate. And is like, \u0026ldquo;Great point! That\u0026rsquo;s why we have so many– that makes a lot of sense. That\u0026rsquo;s why we have so many sightings of her. That\u0026rsquo;s– I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything by it. I was just asking questions.\u0026rdquo; Um, and– that\u0026rsquo;s a terrible phrase, obviously, but they mean it in that– in a great, like, self-effacing, like, \u0026ldquo;You know that I was fighting you, but you\u0026rsquo;re fighting back, and that\u0026rsquo;s great. That\u0026rsquo;s what I was looking for.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I leave them– I leave them to their reindeer games and, uh, and– head off to bed.\nJAM: Okay!\nGF: [Singing] Scrubbin\u0026rsquo; around in the timeline, messin\u0026rsquo; things up!\nAlright.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

As a gift to me, remember that communal spaces and events are a particularly great place to wear a high-quality, well-fitting respirator mask, the easiest way to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re just bringing home fond memories and cool stuff, not con crud and… worse.\nThis is episode three of our games of Immanence, a game on a colony ship a thousand years in the future, about \u0026ldquo;exploring our individual and collective relationships with Earth, each other, ourselves, and the greater universe\u0026rdquo; by Marcus Hose.\nWith me again are Jam Edwards, ceding their plug time to the concept of touching a physical object during trying times, and garbageface aka gnostic front aka Karol Orzechowski, bowing out to give the floor to the concept of supporting DIY music, supporting DIY spaces, and doing what you can to look out for each other.\nBefore we get into this episode, I want to note that Jam does one of my favourite randomisation or generation techniques that has popped up on the show so far, or possibly just generally of all time– you\u0026rsquo;ll know when you hear it. It involves another game.\nIn order to get to that, let\u0026rsquo;s see how our passengers\u0026rsquo; time in space is going as we near the halfway point of their trips.\nGAME: DAY FOUR MORNING JAM: Let\u0026rsquo;s do day four.\nGF: It\u0026rsquo;s day four.\nSATAH: It! Is! Day four! In the morning! I rolled a 9.\n\u0026ldquo;You recognize a childhood friend from across the room. Where are you when you see them? Do you catch up? Do you see them again afterward?\u0026rdquo; Oooh.\nYeah, so this is somebody who I haven\u0026rsquo;t had contact with in a very long time. I\u0026rsquo;m just looking through the list of locations. I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll a couple die just to see if any of them are particularly interesting to me; if they, like, give me an idea of where we met that maybe I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had a reason to come up with.\n[Die clattering] Thirteen is the oddity block. Oh god, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll stop there. That\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nSo the oddity block is \u0026ldquo;the birthplace of all things uncanny on this ship. Conveniently, anything that would pose a threat dissipates into thin air before it can cause any harm. Incidentally, the backup engine and black hole drive is also stored here, but it\u0026rsquo;s usually powered down. Usually.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it would make total sense if, like, this childhood friend were an illusion or some sort of trick by this surreal space magic place, right? And I think that\u0026rsquo;s my first assumption. Like, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard stories of the oddity block, which I think I\u0026rsquo;m just passing through. Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s on– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna say that I\u0026rsquo;m going, like, on the way to the farm. Uh, I get up in the morning and I have an open invitation to go check out the irrigation system that they\u0026rsquo;re working on and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Hell yeah, I would love to see your irrigation system.\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;ve never been in that direction of the ship and so I pass through the oddity block for the first time.\nAnd there are some warning signs about, like, being careful about believing what you see and that kind of thing. And I see somebody who I haven\u0026rsquo;t spoken to in, like, twenty-five years across the way. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh. That\u0026rsquo;s a weird pull. I was friends with this person, but why is she being brought to me now? What is the universe doing? What\u0026rsquo;s up, black hole? Uh– is it on?\u0026rdquo; Looking for, like, the signs of, like, \u0026ldquo;This light will be on if the black hole drive is powered up, in which case, get out of here unless you\u0026rsquo;re an expert,\u0026rdquo; blah, blah, blah.\nAnd she looks up and makes eye contact with me and her eyes go wide for a second. And I think she shines, like– she has a tiny little keychain flashlight that is like a black light. It\u0026rsquo;s not literally a black light, but that is certainly what the props department would make it out of– probably just with a little filter over, uh, the- the- the lens so that it comes out a slightly different colour.\nShe points it at me and in some way, that is like a detector of, like– I think probably anything that sort of comes through the weirdness has, like, a distinctive… it has a- it has a residue on it that would light up when you shone this light at it, but I don\u0026rsquo;t light up. And she goes, \u0026ldquo;Holy shit! Forum Urgency! What the fuck are you doing here?\u0026rdquo; And she runs over and we hug and I laugh. I\u0026rsquo;m still not totally sure that she\u0026rsquo;s real, but I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to suspect that she is.\nAnd I laugh and I guess I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;I guess I have the same question for you! I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m headed to Mars.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re- you\u0026rsquo;re part of the– you\u0026rsquo;re part of the exchange group, huh? That\u0026rsquo;s awesome. I\u0026rsquo;m full time.\u0026rdquo; And we– she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I have to do some stuff, but, like, what are you up to? Can you come back later?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I say, \u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo; And I go and I see the farm and I come back and then we catch up. And it turns out that she, like… became an astrophysicist and studied black holes and is, like, a brilliant scientist in the nature of black hole propulsion. Or something like that, like she\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s just– she works in this area, but– that– she was really on the upwards trajectory in academia and realized that, like, she hated it and she wanted to do something much more practical with her studies.\nAnd so she ended up– it\u0026rsquo;s, like, halfway through her thesis defense, she was like, \u0026ldquo;I hate this.\u0026rdquo; And I think that I like the idea that they still gave her– like, her work was so good that she is a doctor. She got her doctorate, but she kind of shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have \u0026lsquo;cause she just bailed. She was like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sick of this. What? I\u0026rsquo;m going to finish this and then go into more school and just do this forever and just read books all my life? Nope. I hate this.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she ended up here through a series of, like– I think that she\u0026rsquo;s very honest that it would just be too complicated to explain in one sitting, the series of events that led her here, but that yeah, she is- she is an engineer, a chaos engineer of some kind, and that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t really get out of this sector a lot.\nI think she\u0026rsquo;s kind of a weirdo. You know? She- she tends to really keep to herself, but she says that she\u0026rsquo;s so happy to see me and that at any point over the next few days she would love if I came and visited.\nAnd I catch her up a little bit on my life and that kind of thing. And she has to– and then she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I got to get back to work, but thank you. And let\u0026rsquo;s– please, let\u0026rsquo;s see each other again.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s like… hell yeah. [Laughs]\nJAM: Day four. Eighteen. \u0026ldquo;The VR arbor– arboretum is hosting your favourite natural landscape. Do you go? Where on earth is the landscape? How long do you stay and what do you see?\u0026rdquo; Ooh! Yeah. Where on earth is the landscape?\nYeah, I do think, um– Hill had some fun with the city folks, uh, is maybe wanting to do some more nature stuff today. I think that Hill goes to Ireland, and in particular the Aran Islands, which I should say I\u0026rsquo;ve not been to. I did go to Ireland last year, so it is top of mind. But, um– but I think Hill goes to the Aran Islands and is looking for… I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– I\u0026rsquo;ll look things up.\nYeah. Like is looking for weird rock formations, which are plentiful. You know. Maybe plentiful is the wrong word. But yes, is- is, like, specifically thinking about other places they can go for- for ideas; is- is still feeling, like, very, like, reflective and wants to do like a little bit more work.\nThey bring their sketchbook with them. And so they are looking for weird rock formations and things. They\u0026rsquo;re visiting the- the wormhole in the Aran Islands, which is just, like, this natural weird hole, um, which maybe- maybe they also haven\u0026rsquo;t visited in real life. Maybe they were a little too scared. Because it is like– it\u0026rsquo;s a big fuck-off hole. [Laughs] In a very sort of wet windy place.\nSo yeah, I think they bring their sketchbook with them and they\u0026rsquo;re looking at that. They\u0026rsquo;re looking at, um… they\u0026rsquo;re going to the Giants Causeway in North Ireland. They\u0026rsquo;re looking at limestone, they\u0026rsquo;re looking at cliffs and weird natural places and- and making lots of little sketches and- and maybe reach a point where they\u0026rsquo;re not, like, doing ideas for puppets anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re just, like, sketching a lot of shapes into their notebook.\nGF: [Die rolling] \u0026ldquo;I hear someone whistling one of my favorite songs from afar. What song is it? Do I seek the whistler out?\u0026rdquo;\nWell, no surprise: what it is is… I wake up to the sound of someone whistling one of the best known Ration-Al songs, which is, uh… Spitfire Chronicles, colon, Speed of Sound.\nAnd, uh…. as I\u0026rsquo;m waking up, it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s just a really– it\u0026rsquo;s a- it\u0026rsquo;s a nice melody to hear. I– again, I have no musical ability, so I can\u0026rsquo;t imitate it, but um– it\u0026rsquo;s just- it\u0026rsquo;s really nice to hear such a familiar- such a familiar sound.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s too early in the morning for me to seek them out. I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m busy doing my stretches because, let me tell you, if I don\u0026rsquo;t do my stretches, I am useless.\nAFTERNOON SATAH: My afternoon roll is a four. \u0026ldquo;One of your favourite fruiting plants is in bloom in the garden and the volunteer attendants are giving away samples. What plants is it– what plant is it? What fruit does it bear?\u0026rdquo; Huh…\nLooking at the garden… \u0026ldquo;The garden slash seed vault. A complete library of Earth\u0026rsquo;s various flora is safely stored in the massive vaults surrounding the ship\u0026rsquo;s botanical garden. Each area is climate controlled for its inhabitant plants. Plants cycle quarterly.\u0026rdquo;\nI think this is a plant that was considered extinct. There were stories of past generations of humans eating this type of fruit, but various ecological disasters and the destructive forces of colonialism and capitalism and et cetera were thought to have destroyed it. And then… like, a single sample was found… mummified? Maybe in, like, a swamp, maybe in amber, something, I\u0026rsquo;m not a hundred percent sure. But it was very carefully and lovingly brought back into existence.\nAnd I think to me… like, this is something that happened while I was in school and it was, like, such a huge, like, beautiful victory for the restoration of the world that it– and- and me and all of my fellow plant dork students, like, celebrated hugely, like, the successful return of this type of– uh…\nI think I like the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s a- it\u0026rsquo;s a vine and it grows some sort of, like, berry in these- in these small clusters. And part of the reason I like that is I like the idea that there was just a livestream constantly, watching this vine slowly creep up, uh, the fence that it was planted against. And then the livestream got bigger as they learned how to grow, like, large fields of it and all that kind of thing.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s just this lovely warm feeling for me of like, \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah! Good. You\u0026rsquo;re preserving that. I\u0026rsquo;m glad.\u0026rdquo; And… I think that… a little detail that\u0026rsquo;s really delightful to me is, like, I finally got a chance to try these berries at one point… and I hated them. Not hated, but didn\u0026rsquo;t, like– like, they are pretty sour? And I just have more of a sweet tooth. So it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where I might enjoy a pie that was made with them, but I really generally am not… after spending so long celebrating the existence of this plant, it was like a very weird moment for me to try it and be, like, bleh!!\nBut. For old time\u0026rsquo;s sake, I try it straight off the vine anyway. And I– there– as the attendants are sort of picking, there- there\u0026rsquo;s a- a- a batch of it that is clearly marked to, like, be delivered to the kitchen. And I say, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m– can I just bring that for you? I\u0026rsquo;m– I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t mind heading in that direction.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I bring it to the kitchen and give it to whoever is accepting deliveries there and basically say like, \u0026ldquo;Hey… any chance that you\u0026rsquo;re going to make some of these into something…\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they, like, look me deadpan in the eye and be like, \u0026ldquo;Edible? Yep. You bet.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, thank god. Okay. Here you go.\u0026rdquo; [Laughing] Yeah.\nGF: \u0026ldquo;Several isolation suites are open. Feel free to use one.\u0026rdquo;\nI go into one of the isolation suites… and I put on… uh… I put on nothing.\nI go into sensory deprivation mode and I cut out everything. It\u0026rsquo;s just me in here in the sensory deprivation suite. They\u0026rsquo;ve engaged the noise canceling, so not even the sound of the engines is on. What a blessing.\nJAM: That\u0026rsquo;s an eleven. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a number of former professional kitchen staff among the passengers and they\u0026rsquo;re taking orders for lunch. Order anything you\u0026rsquo;d like.\u0026rdquo;\nYeah, of course there\u0026rsquo;s professional kitchen staff. We\u0026rsquo;ve got all of the arts covered, as I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned.\nI think also– I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying not to do too much, like, thinking about this world outside of playing the game and sitting down to record because thinking- like, thinking about and fleshing out the world seems to be a lot of the game, and so I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do a lot of that off mic. But I- I did have the thought, like– we have, like, people from all different schools of the arts. We probably have people from all different fields of, like, sciences too. We probably have… just a- a really diverse array of people with different specialties beyond what we traditionally, like, conceive of as the arts. You know, we have people from all walks of life. So, like, yeah, of course we have some chefs.\nWhat does Hill order for lunch?\nI think I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna… I think Hill is in a mood where they don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a bother. I think they\u0026rsquo;re, you know– feeling– still feeling a little bit isolated and withdrawn and don\u0026rsquo;t want to ask for something, like, very particular that would require, like, some ingredients to be dug out or, you know– they don\u0026rsquo;t want to do like a lobster mac and cheese or something that it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Ugh, we\u0026rsquo;ve got to figure out if we have lobster or can create it artificially.\u0026rdquo; Even if that is, like, the conceit of, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, yeah, we can generate anything artificially. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it.\u0026rdquo; I think Hill is still like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to do something normal. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do something not too complicated.\u0026rdquo;\nUm… yeah! And I think they\u0026rsquo;re gonna– I think they\u0026rsquo;re gonna go pizza. Like, a professional chef has said, \u0026ldquo;I can cook anything you\u0026rsquo;d like; anything at all.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they have just said, like, \u0026ldquo;A good pizza. Like, a really good pizza.\u0026rdquo; Because it still feels like a little treat, but is also like, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you already, like, have these ingredients for somebody else.\nUm, so yeah, pizza is the answer. Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and roll evening for day four.\nEVENING GF: \u0026ldquo;The evening traffic simulator is running at the racetrack. Traffic is bumper to bumper, but you can leave whenever you like.\u0026rdquo;\nBack home on earth, before cars were illegal, I used to have a Ford Mustang. It was a 2100 Ford Mustang and it was in surprisingly good shape for being close to a thousand years old. Being in a simulated, uh– being in a simulated, uh, Mustang is certainly not the same, but some of the things that they\u0026rsquo;ve been able to replicate– specifically the smell– there\u0026rsquo;s a kind of acidic, vaguely tobacco-esque smell to the Mustang that is very particular to the way that the leather in the seats and the way that the filling in the upholstery would break down over time. Even sitting in traffic and not moving, being in this old Ford Mustang really brings me back. I had my first kiss in that Ford Mustang.\nDo you remember your first kiss?\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Sixteen!\nJAM: That\u0026rsquo;s a fifteen.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;The Choral Karaoke Club is setting up in the theater block, and they seem to be devoting the night to one musical act.\u0026rdquo;\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;And they seem to be devoting the night to one of your favorite musical acts.\u0026rdquo; The Choral Karaoke Club. There\u0026rsquo;s so many clubs.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Who is the artist or band?\u0026rdquo;\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;Who is the artist slash band?\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Does anyone attend?\u0026rdquo;\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;Do you attend? Do you sing along?\u0026rdquo; Oh boy.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Does anyone sing along?\u0026rdquo; Hehehe.\nJAM: Um, yeah. I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to pick a contemporary musical act, I don\u0026rsquo;t think. Um, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is a 21st century act that Hill is– has connected with.\nUm, I do think it is– it is a band. It is, like… a band that is like partially influenced by, like, rock and punk and partially by, like, jazz… what I\u0026rsquo;m- what I\u0026rsquo;m imagining is like a band that has all of the same instruments as a ska band, but sounds very different. Um. Um, yeah, is- is a much more mellow style of music that occasionally, like, builds into something more- more energetic and- and experimental.\nUm, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s- maybe that\u0026rsquo;s just post-rock. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to come up with new genres.\nUm… do I dare name the band?\nYou know what? I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to this show. I know people use name generators. I can do it too. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try a band name generator, even if it\u0026rsquo;s a bad idea.\nSome of these are bad. [Laughing] This is not a good generator. It\u0026rsquo;s a bad generator. Oh no! Forget this one. Guys, don\u0026rsquo;t use band generators.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to use another tried and true method of coming up with a name for a thing, which is to grab the book closest to me and looking for a two word phrase to use.\nYeah. Yeah, the name of the band is Resident of Halifax.\nUm, does Hill attend? I think Hill does attend briefly. Uh, I think they do want to go and see– um, but it is karaoke, choral karaoke. So everyone\u0026rsquo;s doing karaoke– so it\u0026rsquo;s a sing along.\nYeah. I think they– it\u0026rsquo;s not… the way I describe this band makes me feel like it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly lyrics heavy, um- um, which is a weird pick for the karaoke club, but yeah. So- so maybe Hill goes and is– doesn\u0026rsquo;t– is not really digging it, um, because they\u0026rsquo;re choosing like this band\u0026rsquo;s cracks that have more lyrical content, um, and, like, maybe even like editing out parts of the songs that get into, like, a long sort of noodley more instrumental section, um, to focus on the lyrical parts. And, um, that\u0026rsquo;s not- that\u0026rsquo;s not what Hill was really hoping for. Um, so I think they, they go and– and end up leaving a little bit early.\nBoy, you know. The first day ended up so nice. And now we\u0026rsquo;re– I mean, you know, understandably… having a weird week in space.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;VR equipped stages and seating that shifts and combines to suit the need of each performance.\u0026rdquo; And… \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re soundproof from the outside.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s great.\nI mean, I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t attend. I think I still don\u0026rsquo;t really understand music. [Laughing] I certainly am more interested now that I have seen an orchestra perform, and I- I consider it, but I think that I choose instead to devote myself to my readings.\nI imagine that my new friends had been giving me a bunch of, like, reports that I never had access to or never had reason to- to look at, uh, that have been generated on the ship about spacefaring agriculture and that kind of thing. So I\u0026rsquo;m reading– doing a lot of that reading.\nBut I am wondering… \u0026ldquo;devoted to one musical act. Who is the artist or band?\u0026rdquo;\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s the– it\u0026rsquo;s not this, but it\u0026rsquo;s the equivalent of a, like, My Chemical Romance. You know? Uh, but for… a thousand years from now. And so I like the idea that a lot of people do attend; that it\u0026rsquo;s essentially an emo night, as exists now. And so, yeah. People- people have a great time and I- I\u0026rsquo;m not there. I\u0026rsquo;m having my own fun elsewhere.\nI think I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know– oh, I bet– I like the idea that my friend, the chaos doctor, who works in the engine room goes, \u0026lsquo;cause I like that– the idea of her being that type of quirky is really fun. So, like- she, like, stops by my bunk dressed, like, retro, you know– the equivalent of, like, putting pencil eyeliner on and brushing her hair a little more over her face and is like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I totally forgot– I\u0026rsquo;m going to the Choral Karaoke Club thing tonight. You want to come with? They\u0026rsquo;re doing… uh…\u0026rdquo; future MCR band name.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m- I laugh and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh my god. I forgot how much you used to love them.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Hey!! I still love them.\u0026rdquo; And cracks a huge smile and laughs.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;No, I– I\u0026rsquo;m just going to, I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend the night in.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, cool! Well, have fun, \u0026lsquo;cause I know I will.\u0026rdquo; And flounces off to– to go to emo night. [Laughing]\nDEAD OF NIGHT JAM: So let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens in the dead of night. That\u0026rsquo;s a fourteen. Oh!! \u0026ldquo;The occultists club is meeting in the garden to collect spell components before going to the arboretum to dance around a pyre in a simulated forest. They welcome newcomers. Do you join at any point? What spells do you craft? Who do you dance for?\u0026rdquo; Ohh… who do you dance for? Oh my god.\nOkay. Yep! I think I\u0026rsquo;m going. I think I– I– yeah. I think Hill has been in a funk. I think I\u0026rsquo;m– I keep being tempted to say the character\u0026rsquo;s name to ground myself and in theory, the listener, but, um…\nI am going. Uh, I\u0026rsquo;m going. I think every attempt that I, as Hill, have made to do things that feel familiar and comforting have been a bummer. And I think I, as Hill, get invited, um, and… I think I feel that sort of spark that I did on that first night in the garden. Um, and you know, I think maybe I\u0026rsquo;m already headed towards the garden after the- the karaoke experience, which was not great? Um, I think I\u0026rsquo;m already headed towards the garden, um, to go back to, like, my little comfort zone. But even that is, like– going back there the previous night didn\u0026rsquo;t feel as good. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about that as I\u0026rsquo;m headed there; that, like, yeah, it was really like that sort of change and– and risk and- and things getting weird and different that was exciting and, and made me feel good about being here. And trying to do things that are familiar and comforting has been not serving me well.\nUm, and so as I\u0026rsquo;m approaching the garden, I can see this group of occultists who are– they\u0026rsquo;re collecting spell components and somebody invites me to join them, and, like, immediately Hill is like, yes. Hill is like, this is the thing that I need.\nAnd so, um, I\u0026rsquo;m going to collect spell components. I think… they maybe have specific things that they\u0026rsquo;re collecting. I think Hill is collecting the things that they had sketched before and it maybe, like, didn\u0026rsquo;t occur to them that they could do that? Um, and I wonder even if they\u0026rsquo;re allowed to do that.\nI wonder if the occultist club is, like, slightly breaking a rule here by picking things from- from the garden en masse this way. Um, yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I– that is a little bit fun to me. If, um, Hill is also like engaging in like a little bit of rule breaking, uh, and these are plants that, like, are not going to regrow in time for the meetup with- with our new extraterrestrial friends. Um, but they\u0026rsquo;re also plants that are aesthetic and not, you know, part of the ship\u0026rsquo;s functioning. And so we\u0026rsquo;re breaking a little bit of rules by- by taking some- some samples.\nAnd yeah. Hill is going to take some of the plants that they had previously sketched and they\u0026rsquo;re going to the arboretum to a simulated forest to dance around a pyre.\nOoh boy. Um, \u0026ldquo;What spells do I craft? Who do I dance for?\u0026rdquo;\nI think that shifts throughout the night. I think Hill is definitely, like, trying to give themselves over to this. Um, trying to- to spark that- that excitement again and- and embrace this, even though they are, like, very much, I think not a big woo-woo person on earth. Um, [Laughs] I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we\u0026rsquo;re still using that terminology in the year 3020, but, um. Yeah, I think they are- are trying to embrace this and not to overthink it or think too hard about it.\nSo I think the spell that they\u0026rsquo;re trying to craft is really just, like, summoning them– theirself. Like, trying to- trying to let go of their familiar, comfortable sense of self and summon a version of themselves that\u0026rsquo;s here in space and discover who that is.\nAnd so, in part, I\u0026rsquo;m dancing for myself. I\u0026rsquo;m also, I think, at certain times throughout the night, dancing for, like, the– the entity that\u0026rsquo;s in mind as I\u0026rsquo;m dancing is, like, a puppet and like– a big person-sized puppet that I had made once. Um, the- the one that made me, um, want to- to do this for the rest of- of my life. Um, and I think that that puppet was, like, somewhat alien in appearance, and so there is this like sort of whimsically, um, irreverent appeal of- of that– of dancing for an entity that- that I created, um, but also looks like this powerful being that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually exist.\nAnd then I think I also end up dancing for that vision that I saw on the first night. Of that silhouette, that- that empty person-shaped space that, for a moment, I thought was an alien. And I think trying to dance for the new people that I\u0026rsquo;m going to- to meet, but, like, my mind keeps coming back to that, even though I know that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really- really a sentient entity. My mind keeps coming back and- and dancing to that idea, to that connection that I felt, um, and- and just really living in the meaningfulness of that moment and that feeling that I had in that moment again. Um, yeah.\nAnd I don\u0026rsquo;t think Hill goes to bed. [Laughs] I think they stay out as late as anyone else in– you know, as long as there\u0026rsquo;s other folks still out dancing, they\u0026rsquo;re still out, which is also very uncharacteristic of them.\nGF: It\u0026rsquo;s the dead of night. [Die rolling] \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s neon night at the gymnasium block. Several sports and activities are made over in a dark colour palette with fluorescent neon lights. Do you go?\u0026rdquo;\nUm! You know, I do- I do go this time, because it\u0026rsquo;s been a few days and I- I haven\u0026rsquo;t played Galactic Pickleball in a while and I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to get down– get down to it again.\nThis time, though, what I- what I\u0026rsquo;m really excited about is– [Laughs] one of my favorite things about the dark– the neon nights is, uh, you know, pick– Galactic Pickleball is already one of those games where people really have a good time and smile a lot. And, uh, in this case, uh, it\u0026rsquo;s even more fun because you get to see their little chiclet teeth lighting up in the neon every time they score a goal. Every time they get excited and their little chiclet teeth just pop right out.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s roll dead of night. [Die clattering] Five. No way. Back at the pan-civic simulator. This one is not… oh, yes. Okay. I was reading from the– oh, I might have read from the… there are tables for a one player game and tables for a multiplayer game. I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;re very different. I think that they just address the group versus just an individual. And I might have– I did read– yeah. So it\u0026rsquo;s basically just– \u0026lsquo;cause, for the single person game, it asks like, \u0026ldquo;Do you attend? Do you sing along?\u0026rdquo; And then for the group one, it asks, \u0026ldquo;Does anyone attend? Does anyone sing along?\u0026rdquo; So similar thing, not a huge deal.\nAnd the reason I noticed is that in the multiplayer mode, it just says \u0026ldquo;A major metropolitan center is being rendered.\u0026rdquo; But in the single one, it specifically says \u0026ldquo;your favourite.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd anyway. For the third time… the four nights that I\u0026rsquo;ve been awake, three of them, including tonight, have had my favorite metropolitan center, which I did live in.\n\u0026ldquo;Will I go explore the empty simulated city? Will you be alone?\u0026rdquo;\nI like the idea that… I\u0026rsquo;ve struck up a friendship– like, enough of a friendship with a couple of the people who joined me for dinner the other day that I, like, invite them to come on a walk with me.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where like I\u0026rsquo;m telling a story about when I grew something on a windowsill… you know, in my college dorm room or something. We\u0026rsquo;re, like, just sharing stories of, like, stupid experiments we did in school or early in our career and stuff and… I talk about how I accidentally– I accidentally reintroduced, like, a formerly native wildflower to an area. Like, it had been decimated and then we were– we were working slowly on, like… this- the whole area had just been destroyed in, like, industrialism and we– I think partially, probably, inspired by the success of that one vine plant being brought back, we were very focused on trying to make sure that these areas were growing plants that originated there and that fit their climates.\nAnd I tell this story about how I received a non-official academic chiding of some kind because I was nursing this wildflower as part of my project and I, like, put it in my window and I opened the window and I turned on, like, a fan in the room and it blew a bunch of seeds out into the world kinda before we\u0026rsquo;d done any of the, like, detoxifying of the ground and all that kind of thing. It just was a little ahead of schedule.\nAnd luckily it was– it worked? They like– there was no major emergency and stuff started to sort of pathetically grow and then it spread and it was actually totally fine, but I did get in a little trouble for my carelessness. And I talk about the fact that, like, it was so funny because then every single time I walked by… like, those plants just always grew more heavily in that neighbourhood from then on.\nAnd– whatever, one thing leads to another, and I realise that I can show them. And so we go on this walk. We just go on this little walk and I show them the neighbourhood that I accidentally planted a bunch of these flowers in. [Laughing]\nAnd I think we just kind of sit around and. Yeah. Continue to exchange a couple of those stories. Uh– and it\u0026rsquo;s just like a nice… it\u0026rsquo;s just nice to be able to- to connect with people in that way.\nAnd I do think some of them are– as the chaos doctor said, full-timers, like they live on this ship. But I like the idea that a couple of them are going to be coming with me. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m forming connections with people who I will be in community with.\nAnd also maybe one of them is a full-timer who is like, \u0026ldquo;Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll come with you for a cycle.\u0026rdquo; Like, this ship does this orbit, right? Like- like I established earlier, and so they\u0026rsquo;ll come back– they\u0026rsquo;ll be back to Mars in a couple of years. So, \u0026ldquo;Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll just come spend a couple of years with you because this seems like an exciting new project,\u0026rdquo; and they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re thinking about it.\nAnd that would be nice. It would be nice to have– have people. Uh, when I, when I land there.\nJAM: And that\u0026rsquo;s day four.\nGF: Time for bed.\nGAME: DAY FIVE MORNING JAM: Starting up on day five, let\u0026rsquo;s roll for the morning.\nGF: It\u0026rsquo;s the morning.\nSATAH: [As a jaunty little tune] Day five, morning of day five.\nJAM: That is a three. \u0026ldquo;You hear someone whistling one of your favourite songs from afar. What song is it? Do you seek the whistler out?\u0026rdquo;\nUm, yeah, I think it is– somebody is whistling one of the songs by Resident of Halifax that was featured at the- the karaoke concert the previous night. And so I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t seek them out because I know exactly why they\u0026rsquo;re whistling– why it\u0026rsquo;s stuck in their head. Um, but it\u0026rsquo;s fun to hear.\nSATAH: Thirteen! \u0026ldquo;The pedestrian track around the gymnasium block is set to morning mode.\u0026rdquo; Got birds, simulated sun, babbling brook. \u0026ldquo;Do you partake?\u0026rdquo;\nNo. I think that I am– I get up early and, uh, head to the gardens slash farms, uh, gardens slash farm? Farms. No, there\u0026rsquo;s probably multiple. To help with, uh, something that they\u0026rsquo;ve got going on this morning.\nGF: \u0026ldquo;A group of passengers is heading to the gym block and they say they\u0026rsquo;re short one player for a team game.\u0026rdquo;\nOf course, what are they playing? Galactic Pickleball. Since I just played last night, though, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to join them. I decide instead to stay, uh, in my stasis chamber for the afternoon and write some postcards back home.\nJAM: They don\u0026rsquo;t all have to be super involved. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to go straight to the afternoon on day five.\nAFTERNOON GF: It\u0026rsquo;s the afternoon.\nJAM: Seventeen. Oh, it is another museum block one. Um, \u0026ldquo;the entire history of one Earth subculture is on exhibit in the museum block. What subculture is it? Do you attend? How did that subculture change in the years between 2020 and 3020?\u0026rdquo;\nHmm… I\u0026rsquo;m trying to imagine where I\u0026rsquo;m at right now as Hill, um, having spent all night dancing and invoking spells with a bunch of occultists who I had never met before, um, and… hmm. Am I up for a trip to the museum the next day?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think so. I think– I mean, I think it is maybe something that I had, like, in my big schedule that I have of all of the goings-ons of the ship. Um, it is one that I had marked down as like, maybe check this out, um, and like…\nToday the exhibit, um, like– I think the sports exhibit is still up, but they\u0026rsquo;re sort of cycling through which one is being highlighted, but given the last couple of days that I\u0026rsquo;ve had, I\u0026rsquo;m going to skip it.\nSATAH: Afternoon! Twenty. \u0026ldquo;Your favourite major city is being simulated in the pan-civic simulator. What city is it? What time period?\u0026rdquo; Interesting.\nSo not the metropolitan area, which– I don\u0026rsquo;t- I didn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to live in, but I chose to. This, however, is \u0026ldquo;favourite major city.\u0026rdquo;\nI think the thing is I don\u0026rsquo;t go. I continue– I\u0026rsquo;m still helping at the farm, but I am wondering if it\u0026rsquo;s worth just… I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m basically thinking through like, does it give me something interesting about the character to think about what their favourite city is, especially if we think about multiple time periods?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t think necessarily– like, I think that… if- if they were asked, it would probably, like– like, they might want to see, like, ancient irrigation systems and, uh, early, like– it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a city, you know? They would- they would want to go back– if- if time travel was a thing and see how people were growing stuff.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure they have a favourite major city, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know that they know it? Like, if you asked, I don\u0026rsquo;t think they would have an answer. And they don\u0026rsquo;t go. So I\u0026rsquo;m not– again, I\u0026rsquo;m kind of just kind of just going to skip that one.\nWhich, to be explicit, like: the game says, like, you can go and do whatever you want? Pretty much? And at any point you could, like, just go be in your bunk and just not participate, which I am taking as permission to not participate in things.\nAnd I think that the point of it is more about… prompting the conversation and the thought about the character. And I feel like I was able to, like, get to a sound enough conclusion about who they are there that I feel like I answered to the prompt without, like, strictly going to the location, what it feels like it is in the spirit of the game.\nJust sort of talking through my– I love… rules. I love following rules in TTRPGs. Often when designers say, like, \u0026ldquo;Just ignore any rules that don\u0026rsquo;t fit your purposes,\u0026rdquo; I kind of bristle at that, because I\u0026rsquo;m like, but part of the thing here for me is that you and I– you, the game designer, and I, and also the people around me– are co-creating this experience. And if I ignore your rules, then… you are not contributing to my experience? Um– which sounded much more negative than I meant it. Just that, like, the thing that is fun for me is figuring out how we put all of our contributions together and create something out of that, and so generally just ignoring game mechanics is not what I want to do.\nAnd so I just– for instance, like, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t find it fun to, at this point, just stop rolling a die every time to see what happens, or- or just ignore the tables altogether. Like– I mean, me being me, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t find it as fun to just go through the tables and choose something for every block of time, but more specifically, I also wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to just abandon the tables entirely and just be like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, it\u0026rsquo;s evening! I have six hours. What do I do with my six hours?\u0026rdquo; completely ignoring all of the prompts.\nBut being realistic to the character, they might go do other stuff and I just think that for me, I\u0026rsquo;m still playing the game as it\u0026rsquo;s essentially intended, which is what I like to do.\nI probably repeated myself several times there and I suspect that I did it in a way that is going to make it very difficult to edit into something cohesive. Uh, and what I\u0026rsquo;m going to say to that is it\u0026rsquo;s actual play, baby. [Laughing]\nGF: [Die rolling] The stranger is alone again \u0026ldquo;in the engine room, crying in the ambient light of the fusion reactor.\u0026rdquo;\nThis time, instead of asking them what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, instead of probing or trying to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s happening, I just sit next to them again and I offer my hand and we hold hands. This time, after about an hour of holding hands, they rest their head on my shoulder and I rest my head on their head. And we sit.\nEVENING GF: It\u0026rsquo;s the evening.\nJAM: Blowin\u0026rsquo; through day five, which makes sense given that I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a lot of sleep the day before. Okay.\nSo for evening, that is an eleven. Ah! Again, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a number of former professional kitchen staff among the passengers.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re taking orders for dinner this time. \u0026ldquo;Order anything you\u0026rsquo;d like, including nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nOkay. So I ordered pizza last time. I think this time Hill is now feeling a little bit more daring and experimental, and…\nIs there anything I am, like, craving? Yeah. I think it is– though it is dinner time, I am really interested in a big breakfast and, like, request a big, like– waffles with poached eggs on top and hollandaise and, uh… you know, a- a- a mash of breakfast foods that, like, isn\u0026rsquo;t unheard of, but is, like, if this was not on the menu, this is a very particular request. Um, um, yeah.\nI\u0026rsquo;m getting a big, weird breakfast and I\u0026rsquo;m eating it all. Um, and, uh, and a coffee please.\nGF: \u0026ldquo;The last person I talked to is on the evening news. Who are they and what did they do?\u0026rdquo;\nThe last person I talked to was, uh, Jago. Jago Tudor. And they\u0026rsquo;re on the evening news because, uh… they are one of the scientists on board as part of this cultural exchange, the planet Poseidon.\nAnd one of their discoveries that they\u0026rsquo;ve made while on this particular voyage is they\u0026rsquo;ve been doing experiments with, um, with different types of, uh, cement. And trying to better understand how cement withstands and reacts to, uh, to low gravity.\nOne of the things that they\u0026rsquo;ve found is that there are indeed different kinds of cement and that, uh, since cement is made out of sand, uh… you would think that all sand is the same, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually very, very different. If you ever look at sand under a microscope, uh, you notice that it\u0026rsquo;s actually just like a– about a thousand different kinds of rocks that have all just been pulverized. And so, uh, what Dr. Jago Tudor has discovered is the, uh, prime– the- the best kind of sand with which to create cement. Uh, that will be the strongest available cement, uh, intergalactically.\nPretty cool stuff! Congrats, Dr. Jago. And thank you for your service.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Evening! Eighteen! \u0026ldquo;Fireworks are being simulated in the cupola, rendered visually over various skylines on the massive windows and accompanied by sound effects. Do you watch them? How long do you stay?\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is the cupola? \u0026ldquo;Crow\u0026rsquo;s Nest Cupola: the crow\u0026rsquo;s nest is a large observation deck at the top of the ship that accommodates up to 200 people. Seating is available at the center of the circular room surrounded by a walking path, perfect for stargazing at any hour.\u0026rdquo; Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s fun. Okay.\nYeah, so I like the idea that– you know, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working hard at the farm all day with my new friends… slash colleagues… [Laughs] and we\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go… chill.\u0026rdquo; Um, let\u0026rsquo;s go– and it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like a– we\u0026rsquo;ve been- we\u0026rsquo;ve been staring at the same environment all day, right? Let\u0026rsquo;s go somewhere really different.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a little cafė up in the crow\u0026rsquo;s nest, I like the idea? Just something very small, or you can bring– people often bring picnics up there, but there is that small cafė. It\u0026rsquo;s got, like– basically- a fry- a fry truck in a lot of ways? Like, some pre-made stuff, and then also a poutine, et cetera.\nBut yeah, we go up there to just get a snack and sit on the ground and we\u0026rsquo;re all delightfully surprised by the fireworks when they begin. And we stay, in part, because, like, we\u0026rsquo;re exhausted and it\u0026rsquo;s kind of nice to have this loud spectacle as an excuse to just be companionably quiet together? We\u0026rsquo;re just eating these weird–[Laughs] I was picturing a huge thing of nachos for some reason. We\u0026rsquo;re just eating nachos. Just eating nachos from this weird food truck and watching the fireworks and being satisfied at how tired we are from manual labor all day.\nJAM: Okay. That\u0026rsquo;s evening.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s see what\u0026rsquo;s happening in the dead of night and see if I make it there considering how tired I am from farm work all day.\nDEAD OF NIGHT JAM: Day five, night. The roll is two. Hmm! Ooh. Okay. Huh. Number two, \u0026ldquo;the cryptozoologist club is hosting encounters with everything from cryptids to yokai in the arboretum. Will you attend? What mythological creature do you meet?\u0026rdquo;\nUm! I- I- I\u0026rsquo;ve got to go. I think– I think this is one that I would have marked off on my schedule as like, don\u0026rsquo;t miss this one. It is definitely something, like– as somebody who, like, designs creatures for my, like, puppet trupe, is one I wanted to go to, like, for professional reasons as well as personal reasons, to, like, get ideas and that kind of thing.\nAnd even though it- it feels a little more in line with the like, you know– I think Hill is feeling a little refreshed today. Like, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve got like a slight buzz from staying up all night and there is a temptation to, like, reject my planned schedule that I made before the trip started. But I think this one in particular, because it is not, like, exploring a familiar thing, because it is, like, meeting a new thing and a thing that– I don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity just on my own on Earth to meet simulated mythological creatures. Um, yeah. I\u0026rsquo;m still going.\nWhat mythological creature do I meet? Oh… I don\u0026rsquo;t like that though. Yeah, my first instinct was because I\u0026rsquo;ve done such, like, a Providence heavy focus and this, like, Big Nazo inspired puppet focus, um… like, my first thought was Cthulhu. But I don\u0026rsquo;t– you don\u0026rsquo;t know that that\u0026rsquo;s actually what I want. I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t love– I hey. I\u0026rsquo;ve brought Cthulhu into tabletop games before. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is one I want to bring Cthulhu into. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s the, uh, the situation.\nBut what- so what mythological creature is Hale really interested in meeting?\nI mean, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of open to whatever\u0026rsquo;s there. Like- like, certainly, I think there\u0026rsquo;s people there making requests, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m one of them. I think I\u0026rsquo;m– I\u0026rsquo;m, like, very, very much in a \u0026ldquo;surprise me\u0026rdquo; kind of mood for this.\nAnd so I\u0026rsquo;m going to try another– maybe not a generator, but maybe just a list of mythical creatures. Mmm… I really hope it\u0026rsquo;s a, you know, a somewhat international list.\nOkay! Alright. So I\u0026rsquo;m– Wikipedia is pretty good for this. The list is too long.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to do something stupid, um, and go grab my alphabet dice from my Scattergories game and try to roll a few letters in a row to control F to see what kind of mythical creature shows up. Oh boy. One second.\nOkay. I\u0026rsquo;ve got my alphabet dice. I will say, if you are trying to do something like this where you need to, like, generate a word instead of– or, you know, letters instead of numbers, you can certainly just assign letters to different sides of a 20-sided die. Um, but since I have the alphabet dice, which came with the board game Scattegories, I will use it.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s see. First letter is M and second letter is H. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if there\u0026rsquo;s anything… hmm. so we\u0026rsquo;ve got two that– okay. A lavellan, also spelled L-A-M-H-A-L-A-N. I\u0026rsquo;m curious about this one because it showed up under the category \u0026ldquo;insectivores,\u0026rdquo; which I think is such a fun category for mythological creatures when like so many of them are based on specific animals or, like, specific sort of domains, like lightning or water. And this one was just insectivores. It might have been one of not many insectivores? Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s the only one listed under insectivore. That rules. Okay.\nWhat does it look like? Lavellan. Do we have any pictures? Oh, is it just a guy? No, no, that\u0026rsquo;s from a video game. Well!\nOkay. So in Scottish folklore, a lavellan is a creature from Northern Scotland. \u0026ldquo;It is generally considered to be a kind of rodent and the name lavellan is also used for a water shrew or water vole in Scottish Gaelic. However, broadly larger than a rat, very noxious and lived in deep pools and rivers. Its poisonous abilities were legendary. It was said to be able to injure cattle over a hundred feet away.\u0026rdquo;\nWhoa! I say this if it\u0026rsquo;s real, um– mmhmm. Hm. Huh. So I guess it\u0026rsquo;s a weird stinky poisonous rat that I\u0026rsquo;m meeting?! Sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s what happens when you\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;surprise me,\u0026rdquo; um, and everyone else is meeting unicorns and pseudo dragons and, uh, you know, kelpies and various creatures and, um… Hill rolls up and is like, \u0026ldquo;Surprise me. I just am in the mood to meet anything,\u0026rdquo; and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Well, here\u0026rsquo;s a weird, slightly large stinky poisonous rat.\u0026rdquo;\nYeah! Oh, they\u0026rsquo;re kind of cute. I found an older illustration. They just, like, are like, just very big shrews.\nI mean– I do think, like, as Hill, I\u0026rsquo;m stoked. I\u0026rsquo;m like, this is not a creature I would have thought of. This is not a creature that I really knew about and, um, and just sort of being face to face with this sort of mundane looking mythological creature is– it probably feels a little bit exciting! Like it\u0026rsquo;s a new-to-me mythological creature, um, and…\nAm I feeling, like– I mean, I think I am feeling, like, inspired to create and design based on this, um. That, you know– not everything has to be a- a– not everything has to have a bunch of tentacles and wings and claws and horns and whatever. That, um, you can create something bizarre and- and beautiful just based on, like, a very mundane little rat that lives in a river.\nAnd– oh, other account describe it resembling a shrew or a lizard. Yeah, a little shrew lizard! This is perfect! This is great! I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled with this! Um, and I think– other– the cryptozoologists maybe– some of them probably feel a little bad when I say \u0026ldquo;surprise me\u0026rdquo; and they sort of, like, from their list of possibilities, like, pick this one randomly to generate and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, geez. Sorry.\u0026rdquo; Um, but I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled. And, um, and, you know, hopefully, at least some of them are, you know, just happy that I\u0026rsquo;m happy.\nYeah! So I hang out with this little lizard shrew rat, this lavellan for a little bit. I\u0026rsquo;m going to write that creature\u0026rsquo;s name down so I don\u0026rsquo;t forget it. Yeah, and totally bust out my sketchbook and take some sketches of it. Um.\nGF: \u0026ldquo;Directories show a lone occupant in the crow\u0026rsquo;s nest…\u0026rdquo; cue-pola. Coo-pola. … \u0026ldquo;Would you go see who they are? Who are they? What kind of emotional state might they be in?\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to go see who they are. I stayed up extra late yesterday and I\u0026rsquo;m very tired. I also feel a little emotionally drained from my consecutive days holding hands and absorbing sadness. And so, uh, even though I see the lone occupant in the crow\u0026rsquo;s nest… [Hesitant in his pronunciation] cupola?\nJAM \u0026amp; SATAH: [Reverb-y clips of pronouncing \u0026ldquo;cupola\u0026rdquo; in varying ways with varying levels of confidence]\nGF: I don\u0026rsquo;t go to see who they are.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Eleven. \u0026ldquo;The insomniacs among the volunteer kitchen staff are up performing uncanny acts of culinary artistry. Order anything–\u0026rdquo; in italics– \u0026ldquo;you like, including nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m headed back to my room. I like the idea that a couple of us actually fell asleep at the picnic, um, and that\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons it\u0026rsquo;s after midnight now is that– we just kind of– a few of us just ended up sleepin\u0026rsquo; under the fireworks. That\u0026rsquo;s how exhausted we are. We fell asleep during fireworks.\nAnd, like, as long as everybody seems comfortable and like they\u0026rsquo;re not going to wake up unable to move their neck… whatever! Let\u0026rsquo;s just- let\u0026rsquo;s just let you sleep up here. It\u0026rsquo;s safe. Who cares?\nAnd I wake up a little disoriented and then, like, laugh and I think I wake up my companions like, okay. We should all get to bed.\nAnd as I\u0026rsquo;m walking back, somebody pops out of the kitchen. The person who I delivered those berries to the other day pops out and is like, [Aggressive stage whisper] \u0026ldquo;Hey!\u0026rdquo; and pulls me in.\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;ve made– with- with the berries– they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re, like, experimenting with a new recipe and they have aspirations of making a pie, but they\u0026rsquo;ve made tiny little hand pies, just to test out the filling. And they give me one. And it is, like, one of the most delicious things that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever tasted. Partially \u0026lsquo;cause it was a long day and I\u0026rsquo;m probably a little hungry still, and I\u0026rsquo;m a little disoriented from exhaustion and physical exertion and waking up in an unfamiliar place, but also it is just… so good.\nAnd- and they\u0026rsquo;re a little conspiratorial about it. They\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Usually we don\u0026rsquo;t have outs– you know, we don\u0026rsquo;t have outsiders testing our recipes,\u0026rdquo; they say, like, fully aware that they\u0026rsquo;re being ridiculous, \u0026ldquo;but, like, you delivered the goods. So you get the first sample.\u0026rdquo; And it is so good. And they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, great. Not gonna lie. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of a relief to meet somebody else who thinks that these are better… how do I put this diplomatically … As the basis for further development of flavour, rather than as the flavour themselves.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I choke lightly on the bite of pie in my mouth and nod and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, you can trust me. If this still tasted like it does right off the vine, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have this face,\u0026rdquo; and, like, circle my very obviously blissful excited face.\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, good,\u0026rdquo; and clap me on the back and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;You can take that, but hey, remember not to let anybody know where you got it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yep, yep. Okay. Sworn to secrecy. I get it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd head off– head off to- to fall right back asleep, uh, after finishing my little pie.\nJAM: Uh, that\u0026rsquo;s day five! And yeah, I do think I got to go to bed. On this day I do not pull another all nighter. I have a good long sleep.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. To find where you can find the show, check out foliopod.carrd.co.

We woke up out of cryo sleep nearly a week ago, and we are only two days from arriving at our destination. Dawn of the final days, 48 hours remain. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nGAME: DAY SIX MORNING JAM: Okay, day six.\nGF: It\u0026rsquo;s the morning of day six. We\u0026rsquo;re getting close now.\nSATAH: So last night, an indie theater here in Ottawa started a new, like, regular screening series that they\u0026rsquo;re calling The Zone that is exploring, uh, arthouse sci-fi, and their first screening was Solaris, the Tarkovsky movie. And so last night I spent three hours just really marinating in, uh, 70s Soviet Union sci-fi aesthetics, and halfway through the movie I was like, \u0026ldquo;Holy fuck, I\u0026rsquo;m so excited to go home and finish the game of Immanence.\u0026rdquo; Um, but that movie is three hours long, and so I was very tired. [Laughs] So I\u0026rsquo;m– I\u0026rsquo;m doing it this morning, but just like, when it comes to it, absolutely just at least imagine that somebody in the background of these shots is wearing, like, an inexplicable slutty little yellow mesh tank top under a leather jacket with strappy flight suit pants, and just touching a bunch of buttons and- and- and flicking switches and recovering video and audio logs, etc.\n[Laughing] Not gonna totally pivot here on day six, but it does feel relevant to the– uh, I don\u0026rsquo;t… uh– oddity- oddity corner? What was that place called? Yeah, the oddity block. That\u0026rsquo;s definitely– the entire station around Solaris is one big oddity block.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what happens in the morning of day six.\nJAM: For the morning, the roll is eighteen. Oh, okay. \u0026ldquo;The VR Arboretum is hosting your favorite natural landscape again. Do I go? Where on Earth is the landscape? How long do I stay and what do I see?\u0026rdquo;\nSo am I again looking at rock formations in Ireland? Um, or are we somewhere else? Um, or do I go? No, I think- I think I sleep in. I think I\u0026rsquo;m, um, um, yeah. I think I- I skip that on this day. I think I\u0026rsquo;m– I pulled an all-nighter and now I\u0026rsquo;m sleeping in on- on the morning of- of day six.\nGF [TEXT TO VOICE VERSION]: \u0026ldquo;Another passenger leaves the area you\u0026rsquo;re in as soon as you arrive. Where are you? Do you know them?\u0026rdquo;\nGF: This morning I really want to go to the VR suite and I want to put on- put on the VR goggles and have a little experience of, um, doing one of my favourite activities, which is quartz painting. Uh, I actually don\u0026rsquo;t have my quartz painting materials with me, um– we had very strict requirements for what we could bring with us, and because there will be quartz painting supplies, uh, when I arrive, uh, on Mercury, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to bring my painting supplies and so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna- I\u0026rsquo;m gonna put on the VR goggles and do some painting.\nBut when I get- when I get to the VR suite, another passenger leaves as soon as, uh, as soon as I get there. I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t know them, uh, but I know that they\u0026rsquo;re one of the other sort of artsy types that\u0026rsquo;s part of this cultural exchange and I don\u0026rsquo;t know who they are. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re another painter, maybe they feel- maybe they feel jealous of my achievements. Or maybe they think I\u0026rsquo;m a hack.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Five. Ah, yes! \u0026ldquo;Another passenger steps out of a VR suite, leaving it vacant in a single seat concert hall configuration. Do you use it? What do you listen to if you do?\u0026rdquo;\n[Thoughtful sigh] So last time this happened, I continued watching, like, the- the orchestra that they had been watching.\nOhh, so– uh, not yesterday, but the day before, my childhood friend, the- the- the one– the- the black hole engineer invited me to the emo night karaoke for that one, uh, future MCR-alike band. And I like the idea that I am going to watch a concert of theirs and there\u0026rsquo;s, like, there\u0026rsquo;s a specific memory tied to it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s a show that I went to \u0026lsquo;cause that doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem strictly likely. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a show that she invited me to when we were kids and I was going to go, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t for some reason. Probably if– if I was looking at thematically in our lives, it seems like, you know, she has her thing where she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get stuck in academia and sort of ejected herself and went and became a more hands-on engineering type. And I\u0026rsquo;m– I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely been in… no. I was trying to see if there was a mirror there. Like she went to the concert and I skipped to do homework. But I think, like– there isn\u0026rsquo;t actually a mirror there because it sounds like I\u0026rsquo;ve kind of been working with my hands– I happen to be in a– I happen to be in a science that is very physical, right? Like, she could be doing theoretical black hole physics and the like, but I happened– I went into something that was very physical. And so I don\u0026rsquo;t quite have the same thing there.\nWhat– why didn\u0026rsquo;t I go? Could be something as simple as I got sick, parents wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let me… we could have been in a fight? \u0026lsquo;Cause I think the idea that I have here is that like, you know, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about that. I\u0026rsquo;ve been like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, yeah, uh, she did really love that band. Oh, yeah, I remember she even went to that concert and I didn\u0026rsquo;t go.\u0026rdquo; And then I,like, load it up or- or a– a facsimile [Stumbling over the pronunciation of that word]- facsimile- facsimile of it. And- and watch that and be like, \u0026ldquo;[Pleased] Ugh,\u0026rdquo; partially so that I– if I see her again, I can be like, \u0026ldquo;I see why you became such a big fan,\u0026rdquo; like, \u0026ldquo;I would have been too, if I\u0026rsquo;d been there.\u0026rdquo;\nMaybe the reason doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Yeah. I\u0026rsquo;m getting too caught on it, I think so it– \u0026lsquo;cause- \u0026lsquo;cause the other ideas would be like, it was something that was like a rift in our friendship, right? Like, she went with other friends and that kind of caused us to start drifting away from each other?\nOh, I like that, actually, specifically because… I like the idea that I forgot about that. Like, so she went to the show and she went with other friends and I was like, \u0026ldquo;[Judgmentally] Okay.\u0026rdquo; And we, like, started to kind of drift apart. And that\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons why we didn\u0026rsquo;t, like, keep in touch when we ended up living in other cities and that kind of thing, because there had been a little bit of a schism driven into the friendship there.\nAnd I don\u0026rsquo;t remember that until I tell her. I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I went and I finally watched that concert!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that must be a big relief. You were so mad.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;I was?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she, like, looks at me in confusion, like, kind of delighted confusion is like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah! That basically, like, broke our friendship. At least that\u0026rsquo;s how I thought of it,\u0026rdquo; and she talks about how she, like, leaned in really hard to the band. She did genuinely love them, but also she was like– there was a tiny aspect of it that was like, \u0026ldquo;Well, fine. If it\u0026rsquo;s such a big deal that I go and see this band, then I guess it\u0026rsquo;s a huge part of my identity.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I tell her like– and I, like, kind of like laugh in disbelief and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, you\u0026rsquo;re right! I was so mad at you! That\u0026rsquo;s so funny because over the years, whenever I think about that band, I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about you, and it\u0026rsquo;s just been totally warm as a memory for me. Like, I\u0026rsquo;ll be like, \u0026lsquo;Oh, future-MCR! Oh, my friend- my childhood friend really liked them. Aww. I hope that she\u0026rsquo;s doing okay,\u0026rsquo; with, like, no memory of the negative feelings that it had caused.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s just kind of a fun… I don\u0026rsquo;t know, there\u0026rsquo;s something– I like the idea that I\u0026rsquo;ve been misremembering and miscategorising that. And she admits, like, \u0026ldquo;When I saw you, I was worried you\u0026rsquo;d still be mad. I hoped not, because it\u0026rsquo;s been twenty-five years, but you never know.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I just, like, I\u0026rsquo;m shaking my head laughing and just being like, \u0026ldquo;Nope, you\u0026rsquo;re lucky! I replaced all of those memories with the, uh– with the- the Latin names for specific genuses of plants, et cetera.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Great show, right?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo;\n[Giggling] Yeah. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\nAFTERNOON GF: It\u0026rsquo;s the afternoon. [Die rolling] \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a number of kitchen staff taking orders…\u0026rdquo;\nOh yeah, I know what I\u0026rsquo;d like today. In the late 2900s, scientists isolated protein from water. And you might be saying to yourself, \u0026ldquo;Protein from water? That\u0026rsquo;s unpossible.\u0026rdquo; Well, it was, before twenty-nine hundred and… and eighty-two. But in 2982, some scientists isolated protein from water and created something called aquabacon.\nAquabacon is delicious. Tastes just like real bacon. It\u0026rsquo;s got the crunch, it\u0026rsquo;s got the snap, it\u0026rsquo;s got the smokiness, it\u0026rsquo;s got everything you want. And I\u0026rsquo;m ordering myself an aquabacon and tomato sandwich, thank you very much.\nSATAH: Afternoon. [Die clattering] I touched the die so I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t– I can\u0026rsquo;t count that one. [Die clattering] Okay. \u0026ldquo;Several isolation suites are open. Feel free to use one.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m just going to scroll down and remind myself what the isolation suites are. \u0026ldquo;These compact suites serve as a space to be alone with oneself or others capable of sensory deprivation upon request, inaccessible from the outside once occupied, except in the case of emergencies to allow entrance to certified and vetted emergency personnel.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I need that. I think that I spent the first few days of this week very alone. And obviously there is… a difference between being alone but also still having the sensory experience of, uh, being surrounded by other people in a way that can be overwhelming, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think that that\u0026rsquo;s a huge issue for me, and I think I don\u0026rsquo;t really need– that isn\u0026rsquo;t, like, a mode of recovery I need. I need more people around.\nAnd there is clearly, like, you can bring someone else in there for whatever reasons you want to be alone with somebody. But… not that there isn\u0026rsquo;t anybody who I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to have some kind of, like, private alone time with, whether to, like, sleep together or scheme or whatever, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think that I have anything to the extent that I would need that intense level of privacy.\n\u0026lsquo;Cause, like, presumably people still, like, have sex in their bunks, right? You\u0026rsquo;re not always, like, going to an isolation room just to hook up with somebody.\nI\u0026rsquo;m scrolling to look at what it says about the bunks. Yeah, everybody has private rooms or can if they want. So yeah, yeah. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s anything that I need that particular type of privacy or sensory deprivation slash just quiet time for. I think I\u0026rsquo;m good.\nJAM: The afternoon of day six is an eight. Oh boy. \u0026ldquo;A stranger is alone in the engine room, crying in the ambient light of the fusion reactor. If you ask them what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, they will say, \u0026lsquo;Nothing.\u0026rsquo; Do you say anything? Do you acknowledge them at all? Why do you think they\u0026rsquo;re upset?\u0026rdquo;\nHoo. Yeah. So I\u0026rsquo;ve rolled out a bit a little bit late. I\u0026rsquo;m a little bit out of sorts and I\u0026rsquo;m just going to check the appendix for the engine room to see if there– anything else makes sense here. \u0026ldquo;Engineering is the heart of the ship, a glowing cold fusion reaction that powers everything from the ion engines to the nightlights. Reaction itself sits behind several radiation proof domes and fields that refract the light it produces bathing the surrounding area in soft, undulous light that ranges in hue from pink to violet.\u0026rdquo;\nUm… I\u0026rsquo;m curious why I went to the engine room. I do think because– the way that the light was described there, I think there is some appeal to that. I\u0026rsquo;m having this slower morning and- and maybe just looking for parts of the ship that I haven\u0026rsquo;t explored yet. And I think the engine room is also really appealing because it is another place that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t go on Earth. It\u0026rsquo;s not, like, trying to recreate an Earth thing. This is sort of grounding me in the feeling of being in space.\nAnd so Hill is heading to the engine room and there is a stranger alone there crying in that beautiful ambient light.\nI think, us being the only two person there, it is so awkward for me to not acknowledge them. I do maybe say, like, \u0026ldquo;Hi…\u0026rdquo; Um, they\u0026rsquo;re crying– I think I would say, \u0026ldquo;Are you okay?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they probably just say, \u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy do I think they\u0026rsquo;re upset? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why they\u0026rsquo;re upset. And that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I think- I think- yeah, I will say, \u0026ldquo;Are you okay?\u0026rdquo;\nThey\u0026rsquo;ll say, \u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo;\nI might say, \u0026ldquo;Do you want me to leave?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think they\u0026rsquo;ll say, \u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s fine.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so I\u0026rsquo;ll stay for a little bit, um, and, you know, walk around the engine room, look at- look around at the stuff. Um, I think I\u0026rsquo;m- as Hill, I\u0026rsquo;m probably trying not to speculate about why they\u0026rsquo;re upset. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I– I- I think about introducing myself. I decide not to. I- I think about, like, what I would want if it was me and trust them at their word and- and, um, don\u0026rsquo;t- don\u0026rsquo;t leave immediately, spend awhile, but also don\u0026rsquo;t- don\u0026rsquo;t engage them much more than that.\nUm, if I have a little pack of tissues in my pocket, which often, as- as Jam, in my real life, I do, I- I think Hill would offer them a tissue if they have anything on them, but that\u0026rsquo;s as far as it goes.\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s roll for the evening on this day.\nEVENING GF: It\u0026rsquo;s the evening.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s see what I get up to this evening. [Die clattering] Four. \u0026ldquo;The evening traffic simulator is running at the racetrack. Traffic is bumper to bumper, but you can leave whenever you like. Do you partake? What car do you replicate?\u0026rdquo; This one is so funny to me.\nNo, I don\u0026rsquo;t partake. Um. What do I do instead? Maybe this is when I meet up with my childhood friend, the chaos doctor, and talk to her about the concert that I saw earlier this morning. And, uh, the traffic simulator can be the background.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where, um– she has noticed certain energy anomalies when this simulation is running and she wants to like observe and know why, which luckily for us, kind of takes the form of like a pleasant stroll around the block. [Laughs] Looking at cars, looking at people, and just talking, while she probably has, like, a machine in both hands– and has deputised me to carry one– that are just, like, recording the output of something so that she can further analyze it. And she\u0026rsquo;ll notice– you know, there might be certain like visual things that she can notice, but mostly we\u0026rsquo;re just walking around recording energy signatures for data and talking about… the conversation I described earlier about our- our childhood schism and the band.\nGF: [Die rolling] It\u0026rsquo;s sleepaway night at the museum block.\nI decide to participate because I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually been to the museum block yet on this trip and I always really like going.\nThe museum block aboard the TCS Lone Ranger is, uh, actually a museum- a cowboy museum. It\u0026rsquo;s the intergalactic cowboy museum. Although, let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, it largely focuses on the cowboy exploits of Earth because most other planets in the intergalactic system… uh, well, one, didn\u0026rsquo;t have cows and two, mmm, didn\u0026rsquo;t have boys, exactly. And so the cowboy museum largely revolves around cowboy exploits of earth, but it\u0026rsquo;s got some really, really cool exhibits in there.\nAnd I– as much as I had very many disagreements with his politics, I sleep in the Ronald Reagan exhibit. The- the Gipper.\nI think that was his nickname. The Gipper. Let me see– [Typing] the Gipper. Whoa, weird. Oh, Ronald Reagan played the Gipper. Okay, the Gipper was an American football player named George Gipp and I guess Ronald Reagan played this guy.\nAnyway, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t- doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Ronald Reagan also played a whole bunch of cowboys and there is, uh, a bunch of statues of him playing cowboys, and again, I did not agree with his politics, uh, even though I was born about a thousand years, uh, after they mattered, but I do really love some of those old cowboy movies and that\u0026rsquo;s where I sleep.\nJAM: That\u0026rsquo;s an eleven for the evening. It\u0026rsquo;s more food. It\u0026rsquo;s more food. Okay– this is kind of great because this is– for one to roll multiple times, this is one that it makes sense that I would be doing every day.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ve done the sort of cautious pick of just, like, good pizza. We\u0026rsquo;ve done a more indulgent pick of, like, big weird breakfast.\nI think having had a good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep now, maybe in a little bit more of a stable mood and having the, like, slightly weird experience this morning and not really having anyone to talk to about that– not that, like, I necessarily need to debrief about seeing somebody crying, but- but you know. Just- maybe seeing somebody, like, alone and very emotional was a little bit reinforcing of, like, I still don\u0026rsquo;t really have anyone I could talk to if I was that upset.\nI think Hill is feeling– not necessarily feeling isolated like they were, but is just, like, thinking more about people that they know, thinking about their connections who aren\u0026rsquo;t here and are going to order something that\u0026rsquo;s not, like, one of their old favourites, but is, like, a favourite of– I think, like, of River, who is still in stasis. And yeah. I think River\u0026rsquo;s not getting out till the last day, day seven. And so, um, yeah.\nSo Hill is thinking of them and orders one of their favourite dishes, one of River\u0026rsquo;s favourite dishes. And I think it is like a szechuan noodle dish that is, like, just a little bit too spicy for Hill actually. Like this is my friend\u0026rsquo;s favourite and they have a higher spice tolerance than me, but I miss them and so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna eat it.\nYeah, that is that\u0026rsquo;s the direction we\u0026rsquo;re going in today. Even if it is, like, a slightly uncomfortable sensation, it is one that reminds them of their friend and so there is some joy in that.\nOkay, that is evening. Yes? Yes, that is evening. And now it is night.\nDEAD OF NIGHT GF: It is the dead of night.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] Dead of night, fourteen. \u0026ldquo;The occultists club is meeting in the garden to collect spell components before going to the arboretum to dance around a pyre in a simulated forest. They welcome newcomers. Do you join at any point? What spells do you craft? Who do you dance for?\u0026rdquo;\nI think it would make sense for me to go to the garden. This is, like– so, I\u0026rsquo;ve been befriending people who work in these areas, right? And I get invited to to come and, uh– very similarly to the conversation that I had with the chef– uh, with the cooks– about, like, different ways that you prepare ship-grown produce. The– I get invited to just have a brief similar conversation with one of the, like, magic users as they\u0026rsquo;re- as they\u0026rsquo;re– I\u0026rsquo;m, like, following them around as they\u0026rsquo;re collecting and just talking to them about, like, what have you noticed? Does this stuff burn differently? Do you notice different effects? Does it smell different? How have you had to change your rituals and how has your relationship to these things changed?\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re also offering, I guess, a spiritual angle on it specifically, like talking about the ways that a lot of faiths and spiritual practices have an element of honouring Earth. Like, thanking the Earth for producing certain things. And this person just shares, like, conversations that they\u0026rsquo;ve had in like, do we continue to do that because that is the, like, original progenitor of all of this stuff? Or has it changed enough that we should start, uh, honouring someone else? Do we talk to the ship? Is that the thing that we are– is it– what was it– Magnitude?\nAnd I bet that there\u0026rsquo;s a hint of a very specific sect that has started splintering off, that is a little bit more intense about… essentially, like, it\u0026rsquo;s– they\u0026rsquo;re starting some sort of like Magnitude religion, right?\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of asking practical questions and I\u0026rsquo;m getting practical answers, but also getting further details of, like, areas that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have thought to explore because it just isn\u0026rsquo;t the way that I relate to any of these materials.\nAnd I think I go to see some of this celebration or ritual or whatever it is, but only very briefly. This is a group that– at least this very specific group is a group of people who have, like, a shared faith or belief system of some kind, but they are from all over Earth. They were living kind of everywhere. And so they had to– when they wanted to recreate a ritual space, they had to have, like, conversations about what it looks like. Does this look like sort of our place of origin or theoretical place of origin, or does it look closer to what, like, the experience of the sort of, like, diaspora would have seen? And coming to, like, a shared– creating like a shared vision that encompasses both of those things.\nAnd I join partially because I want to see like what their vision of that was– like, people having different memories of trees and what they smell like and what they look like and how they grew. Right? And I want to see how that manifested in the simulated forest that they\u0026rsquo;ve created. And so I go and I look at the forest and then they\u0026rsquo;re like building the fire and kind of as soon as they light it, I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Have fun. This was wonderful. Let me know if you think of anything else that would be relevant because I\u0026rsquo;m going to be partially in charge of making sure that all of this kind of stuff is still accessible to people in our new place, so I care about it. Even if I admittedly don\u0026rsquo;t totally get it, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of all the more reason for me to talk to you about it. So I\u0026rsquo;m here all day tomorrow and I will leave some kind of contact information,\u0026rdquo; you know, and then I go to bed.\nJAM: The number for night on day six is two. The cryptozoologists are back! Okay, yep. \u0026ldquo;The cryptozoologist club is hosting encounters with everything from cryptids to yokai.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily love that– that phrasing, um, that those are, like, two ends of a spectrum. Um– they\u0026rsquo;re hosting all kinds of– all kinds of creatures. \u0026ldquo;Will you attend? What mythological creature do you meet?\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do the same thing. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna use my alphabet dice. I have it out. Let\u0026rsquo;s pull up that Wikipedia article of mythical creatures. [Hums a little tune]\nOkay, got my alphabet dice. Let\u0026rsquo;s roll our first letter. E. Second letter P… so still 44 matches. A. Okay, perfect. Four matches. Oh… oh! that combination of letters got us to some fun possibilities. Okay. Oh, Pliny the Elder!\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got- we\u0026rsquo;ve got a legendary sort of cattle or buffalo creature, uh, and we\u0026rsquo;ve got a Yeti.\n[Trying different pronunciations] Catableepus? Catablepus?? Hmm. Ohh… \u0026ldquo;its stare or breath could either turn people into stone or kill them. The catoblepas is often thought to be based on real life encounters with wildebeest. Other depictions have it sporting the head of a hog and the body of a Cape buffalo.\u0026rdquo; So this is from what is now Northern Africa… hmm.\nI mean, maybe I meet both. I think- I think the cryptozoology club is out here simulating all sorts of stuff. I think, um- I think I do ask for- for, like, surprise me. Give me- give me anybody. And catoblepas is… [Mumbling different pronunciations] I- I could not be saying this right. Um– yeah.\nI think I get this- this catoblepas first. \u0026ldquo;Black buffalo with the head of a hog hanging close to the ground joined to its body by a thin neck, long and loose as an empty intestine.\u0026rdquo; Ooh!\nOh, of course, it has appeared in Dungeons and Dragons. Just looking at the Wikipedia article for this for this- this creature now. And in Yu-Gi-Oh! And in the Witcher. OK, maybe I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know this one.\nUm, so, yeah, I do think I see the- the- the catoblepas first, and I\u0026rsquo;m a little startled. I think they maybe describe it to me a bit before, like, as it is being generated and I\u0026rsquo;m expecting, you know, a big cow. A sort of a big weird cow. And what shows up is maybe more like this, like, long neck, these big tusks and this more menacing demeanor kind of creature.\nAnd I think it maybe occurs to Hill for the first time… that this meeting with our new friends could go poorly. I think– you know, they maybe intellectually felt that way. Obviously, people had- had speculated on this, um, but I think they are realising they had been going to this– into this this journey with the assumption that this would be a positive or neutral interaction. And the- the sort of surprise– I think, like, the moment it\u0026rsquo;s generated, also the catoblepas like lets out a menacing cry and fixes me with that stare that, like, in legend turned people to stone. And obviously it doesn\u0026rsquo;t because it\u0026rsquo;s not real, um, but that amount of menace and hostility is recreated.\nAnd it has been so long since I have experienced that and maybe never, like, this up close, that I have like this moment of- of fear shooting through me and- and am very suddenly aware that things could go wrong. In a- in a way that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t, like, emotionally admitting to myself before.\nAnd yeah, I think once that- that, like, moment of shock has- has worn off, I spend, like, a polite amount of time, maybe 30 seconds or a minute, like, walking around the- this creature and- and, like, taking in the details and then being like, \u0026ldquo;Could I see something else?\u0026rdquo; Because this one has- has freaked me out a little too much.\nAnd yeah, I think for the second creature that I see… the other one that I got with my combination of letters was a yeti, and so I think this is one that Hill maybe requests. Like, other people are requesting creatures, but they have not seen anyone request a yeti yet, and so they request a yeti. That could also be intimidating, but I think I\u0026rsquo;m just more prepared for– for what it\u0026rsquo;s going to look like. And the simulation of it is not inherent– not initially hostile. Is more in, like… walking through a blurry photo kind of mode. And I imagine they probably, like, project a few different versions.\nAnd yeah! I spend a little bit more time, like, communing with- with that and feeling again, like, comforted by its strangeness.\nGF: Directories once again show a lone occupant in the crow\u0026rsquo;s nest cupula. And I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go see who they are. I just– something about it is a bit weird and we\u0026rsquo;re getting close to the destination and I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to– I don\u0026rsquo;t want anything like that. I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t need that. You know?\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s day seven. I really… I think it\u0026rsquo;s day seven.\nGAME: DAY SEVEN SATAH: Dawn! Of! The final! Day! Which I just learned– [Laughing] I- I have been, um, getting to know somebody and they talked about their favorite Zelda games and they were like, \u0026ldquo;You should play Majora\u0026rsquo;s Mask.\u0026rdquo; And I was like, \u0026ldquo;Okay!\u0026rdquo; And I have- I have a Nintendo Switch Online membership, so I was able to just play it through the Switch emulator, and… I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that that iconic image, the like \u0026ldquo;dawn of the final day,\u0026rdquo; like \u0026ldquo;dawn of the two days,\u0026rdquo; whatever, was from that. I always assumed it was from, like, an Evangelion or something? [Laughs] Which I also haven\u0026rsquo;t seen.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t experience… I didn\u0026rsquo;t experience media as a child. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand any of your Simpsons references or your Spongebob jokes. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. And I didn\u0026rsquo;t experience any of that stuff either and I\u0026rsquo;ve absolutely just been, like, happily trotting along, like, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s probably a reference to an anime that I never saw!\u0026rdquo; But actually, it was a reference to a video game I never played. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know why that\u0026rsquo;s so funny to me because it amounts to the same thing, but it is funny to me.\nAnd also that game is very stressful. I see the appeal, but… okay. Dawn of the final day.\nMORNING SATAH: What happens to me in the morning? [Die clattering] One! \u0026ldquo;A group of passengers is heading to the gymnasium block and they say they\u0026rsquo;re short one player for a team game. What are they playing? Do you join them? Is it fun?\u0026rdquo;\nThis dork?!\nThe first thing I think of is… oh, what was it called? The sport in Battlestar Galactica… ball… ball sport… what was it? I am going to look it up. Pyramid! Which I think comes to mind partially because it is a sport that is, like, so perfectly able to be played on the ground as well as in the tight quarters of a ship. Not quite as relevant here because this has- this is a big space and can be anything.\nIt isn\u0026rsquo;t literally Pyramid, but it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s something like that. It is it is a- a- a- a- a sport activity [Brief hysterical giggle] that, um, can be enjoyed– enjoyed that is– that is frequently enjoyed very casually, but does have, like– kind of like an ultimate frisbee vibe, almost? Where, like, it is a game where you can just kind of, like, fuck around in a park and play, but also there are people who get very intense with it and have, like, a league? And there are probably like several levels of it on the ship; people who take it seriously to different extents.\nYou can tell by how I talk about sports that I… [Snort] am g– I know… what they\u0026rsquo;re– they are. \u0026ldquo;Sports activity\u0026rdquo;? Okay.\nSo… it\u0026rsquo;s like a couple of the people who were working on the farm with me. Not strictly scientists, but people who do much more of the, like, labour and that kind of thing. Which obviously they\u0026rsquo;re not– those aren\u0026rsquo;t, uh, mutually exclusive, but these are people who specifically, like, don\u0026rsquo;t really care about the research stuff and just want to do the physical parts and enjoy doing that and- and are quite- quite fit and strong.\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Hey! You were pretty handy. Like, I saw you lift heavy- heavy machinery when we were- when we were farming the other day. Wanna play this game with us?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think they all burst into laughter because the look on my face is so horrified before I can control it. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh n– I\u0026rsquo;m sorry- I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. It\u0026rsquo;s not– it\u0026rsquo;s not you– thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me. That that is really wonderful. Uh… I never really learned the rules?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s easy! Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Uhh… I don\u0026rsquo;t know… but– I mean– I guess– can I– I know you\u0026rsquo;re one short, but is it okay if I just… come watch and see what I can figure out?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, totally.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I watch… like, I just sit by the side. And they manage to pick somebody else up along the way, you know– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find people who want to play this.\nAnd I think we just kind of have a delightful thing where I\u0026rsquo;m sitting on the sidelines and then every… at the break of every quarter or whatever, like, segment of game, they ask me for the update of like, \u0026ldquo;So what do you think the rules are?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I try to explain. I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, so it seemed like when you caught the ball… you had to go in this direction, but then you got a penalty, it seemed like, for that? And so you reversed and you\u0026rsquo;re both supposed to go in the other direction– do you swap sides?!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they, like, joyfully are just like, \u0026ldquo;Some of that was almost right? Uh, some of that was just us making really stupid mistakes because we\u0026rsquo;re not very good at this game?\u0026rdquo; [Laughing]\nAnd just kind of spend the afternoon, like, joking around and occasionally having the ball thrown to me, which I refuse to catch, but I will throw back to them.\nGF: [Die rolling] Ever since the karaoke night, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about Ration-Al. And as I\u0026rsquo;m doing my morning stretches and my morning walk, I see one of the passengers that I know \u0026ldquo;step out of a VR suite and it\u0026rsquo;s left vacant in a single seat concert hall configuration,\u0026rdquo; and so, of course, I step into it and I listen to some Ration-Al.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m listening to Ration-Al, there\u0026rsquo;s a… a little mini documentary that plays, um, after one of his songs. It\u0026rsquo;s called… [Laughs] Breakneck Beats, colon, The Race for Recognition. And it\u0026rsquo;s all about Ration-Al\u0026rsquo;s early years.\nJAM: So for the morning on day seven, I again \u0026ldquo;hear someone whistling one of my favourite songs from afar. What song is it? Do I seek the whistler out?\u0026rdquo;\nThis time I might! I think I know that this is the day that River is waking up, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know when that\u0026rsquo;s happening or where they will be. Like, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a plan to seek each other out; I think we just sort of assumed, like, we would find each other.\nSo I think in the morning, as I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m- had my breakfast and I\u0026rsquo;m just walking around figuring out what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do with my day and keeping an eye and an ear out for River, I hear somebody whistling maybe a song that\u0026rsquo;s familiar to us both, and I do track the person down.\nAnd I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s River. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s that easy to run into them, at least initially.\nUm… what song is it? I think it\u0026rsquo;s something old. I think it is, like, pre-20th century. Like, it is a weird old medieval– maybe it\u0026rsquo;s Green Sleeves or something. But yeah, it is, like, that sort of old song, which I think reminds me of- of River and the kinds of things that they drew inspiration from. But I seek the whistler out and it\u0026rsquo;s just somebody else who knows Green Sleeves, which, you know, is fine and makes sense.\nAFTERNOON JAM: Let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens in the afternoon on day seven.\nGF: It\u0026rsquo;s the afternoon.\nSATAH: [Die clattering] The afternoon is six: \u0026ldquo;A lone passenger that you\u0026rsquo;ve never met invites you to join them for a brief stargaze in the Cupola. Who are they? What are they like? Do you join them?\u0026rdquo;\nOoh. Yeah, so, I imagine that over the past couple of days, the slow waking process of my group has been happening. I imagine some people are probably just kept in stasis until we land on the planet, because, like, why not? But there is a small group that– this is when I should have woken up, you know? This last week was not planned for.\nAnd so this is somebody who is in the landing crew with me. Is it a close… coworker..?\nOh, also, I think– just to, like, tie something together, the people who I know who are– who have been in stasis are still in stasis. Like, maybe I wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually going to be woken up today. Maybe I was going to be woken up on the planet. I was supposed to be one of that group, but regardless.\nThis is somebody who I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but who kind of knows me. It\u0026rsquo;s not something as intense as like– like we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re peers. They- they\u0026rsquo;re familiar with my academic work, but they\u0026rsquo;re the same age as me and we\u0026rsquo;re at very similar– we\u0026rsquo;ve- we\u0026rsquo;ve just followed very similar trajectories.\nAnd I like the idea that there was some kind of conference where I was giving a demonstration of something that I\u0026rsquo;d been working on with my team. Whatever- whatever innovation that I haven\u0026rsquo;t really fully defined that I was partially responsible for developing. And this person saw that demonstration and was really excited.\nAnd I think in part, they were a skeptic. Like, they had read reports of the thing that I– me and my team had been working on and they were like, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s… so optimistic. That is never going to work. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe that we\u0026rsquo;re throwing money at this sort of idealised, bordering on pseudoscientific nonsense,\u0026rdquo; and they came to the conference… they were going to go anyway, like they\u0026rsquo;re working in this field, right? But learning that there was a demonstration, they were like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, great. I can go and see it fail. Perfect.\u0026rdquo;\n[Die clattering repeatedly] Oops. I was fidgeting with my die and then I threw it on the ground.\nAnd then it worked. It was a great demonstration and I think that they had– they had a moment of dread. Like, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t positive for them in the moment. It was kind of like a, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been wrong,\u0026rdquo; and… this could have absolutely been a villainous turn for them, you know, where they decide to, like, campaign against this and destroy me and whatever. And they admit they thought about it. And I, like, raise my eyebrows.\nWe are stargazing at this point, which I\u0026rsquo;ll get– I\u0026rsquo;ll get back to.\nBut what happened is, like, they, like, went back to their– they skipped out on the next few things at the conference. They went back to their room and just paced and felt miserable. And then… their room had a, uh, view of the whole conference hall. And they looked down and they saw everybody talking excitedly and showing off all of these projects, some that were very promising and some that were dead ends, but just the enthusiasm. And slowly realised that, like, they\u0026rsquo;ve had the wrong attitude about this? That they have been obsessed with tiny incremental change and slow progress and keeping moves very s– very– just tiny and- and- and careful.\nAnd that… they weren\u0026rsquo;t totally wrong, because there are a lot of people who take big swings in a negative way, and- and they were– they certainly formed this belief in reaction to those sort of people, who do stuff that won\u0026rsquo;t work and they kind of know won\u0026rsquo;t work, but end up throwing themselves fully into it. And so this person was like, \u0026ldquo;I am always- I am always going to make sure that I know exactly what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen before I do something and never lose myself to that kind of thing.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it just dawns on them that they have done themselves an enormous disservice by getting… too closed off, essentially. And this was a slow realisation– it\u0026rsquo;s not, like, all of this; they didn\u0026rsquo;t totally change whatever was their belief system was in this hotel room, looking out at this conference, but it was the beginning.\nAnd they say, like, it was a big leap of faith for them to sign up for this mission, that it felt almost like a test of the growth that they\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to have over the past… oh, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Five years or decade since that conference. And that occasionally they were like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve made the biggest mistake of my life,\u0026rdquo; and then they were looking at the manifest and they saw me, and…\nMaybe that\u0026rsquo;s who the people I know who are still in stasis are, is– partially, like– I think probably some, like, personal friends but also some- some teammates from that kind of era of my life.\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Well, whether it works or not, this was a good choice and this proves that I have– this probably proves in some way that I have successfully pushed myself to be someone who thinks bigger.\u0026rdquo; Who dreams a little bigger, darling.\nAnd this all comes out… like– so, we run into each other at lunch and their eyebrows go up and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;What are you doing up?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like– mouthful of food– I\u0026rsquo;m like, [Muffled like they\u0026rsquo;re talking around food] \u0026ldquo;Excuse me?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they say, \u0026ldquo;Weren\u0026rsquo;t you supposed to– aren\u0026rsquo;t you supposed to wake up planetside?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I, like sw– I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; and I explain what happened.\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like– they look really excited and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, this is… I- I really just kind of got up this morning and there\u0026rsquo;s stuff that I want to see on the ship that I barely have time– will you come with me? I just, I–\u0026rdquo; and they introduce themselves. They\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;I work in the field– I work in this field. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do a little bit of a whirlwind tour. Will you join me on part of it?\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s how we end up stargazing, and then that whole story comes out.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m, like, very surprised. Like, I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine my work having that kind of effect on people?\nAnd they just laugh and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Listen, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying it was totally your work, but… I did take some time to read some of your papers and that kind of thing after, and it does seem like you are one of the people who has that… innate ability to believe that things could be really different. And I- I think I was right that it is innate to you. So innate that you don\u0026rsquo;t even realise it\u0026rsquo;s there. And I admire that. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind that I had to work a little harder for it? And I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I did, but I do admire that in you. And I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to work with you.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m… really excited to work with you.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they… run off to the next thing on their tour. They\u0026rsquo;re trying to hit every single part of the ship, for at least a little while, in this day- this one day that they have on the ship. And I give them a couple of recommendations. You know, I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, make sure that you do this.\u0026rdquo; Oh, I definitely send them to the oddity block, and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Talk to this person. You want somebody who can \u0026lsquo;believe\u0026rsquo;? Holy shit. If you think- if you think that I have the capability of envisioning a different future, you really got to talk to…\u0026rdquo; chaos doctor, childhood friend. I haven\u0026rsquo;t named anybody else. Sorry to them.\nGF: [Die rolling] My favourite city is being simulated in the pan-civic simulator.\nTerrence Halberstam\u0026rsquo;s favorite city is New New York City.\nNew York City was the greatest city in the world up until about… uh, 2500 when it, uh, you know… I mean, without putting too fine a point on it, fell into the ocean.\nNew New York City, which was built just a couple hundred, uh- a couple hundred kilometers, you know, a hundred ish plus miles to the west, uh– basically the point of New New York City was to do everything the same as New York City, but just more better. And so that\u0026rsquo;s what it is.\nNew New York was established in 2550 and it\u0026rsquo;s– even though it\u0026rsquo;s only 400 years old or so, uh, it\u0026rsquo;s– because it was modeled after the old New York City, it has a lot of the sort of same architectural accoutrement and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty beautiful. And I\u0026rsquo;m excited to check it out in the pan-civic simulator.\n[To the tune of Empire State Of Mind] In New New York… [Speaking regularly] and so on.\nJAM: That\u0026rsquo;s a thirteen. So interesting: \u0026ldquo;Another passenger has lost their way to their stasis suite and could use a hand getting back. You know where the suite they\u0026rsquo;re looking for is. Do you help them?\u0026rdquo; Um… boy. It does not say if this is a stranger to me. It does not say if this is a person that I know.\nI… am so interested in maybe this being River. It is also so interesting to roll this one on the last day of our journey, because if you\u0026rsquo;re going into stasis… you\u0026rsquo;re trying to go back into stasis on the last day? I think this is someone who is scared about meeting our new friends. And I think this is resonating with me based on like this moment of fear I had the day before.\nYeah, I think this is River. I think River… got out of stasis, we found each other, and they are just real shaken up about what we\u0026rsquo;re about to do, and maybe not even like, I\u0026rsquo;m lost– I\u0026rsquo;m lost, like, physically in space, like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know the way back to my stasis suite. But it\u0026rsquo;s maybe, like, I can\u0026rsquo;t put myself back into stasis, and I know the crew won\u0026rsquo;t let me be in stasis through disembarkment. I need you to put me back in stasis, um, because I am not actually ready for the thing we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to do tomorrow.\nAnd… do I help them do that? Oh my god. I mean– I think what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling is Hill is, like, initially, like, furious that I\u0026rsquo;ve been awake and alone for a week and now my friend is finally here and the first thing they say to me is, like, \u0026ldquo;I actually don\u0026rsquo;t want to be here and I need you to help me put myself back into a coma so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do the intimidating thing that we\u0026rsquo;re doing.\u0026rdquo;\nUm, and I– I don\u0026rsquo;t think I necessarily express that to River… but… or do I? Oh god.\nNo, I think I don\u0026rsquo;t. I think I tell them, \u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; and I think it is a really hard day.\nI think… I think they are probably in a state. They, like, just woke up from stasis. They\u0026rsquo;re, like, groggy and- and, like, exhausted but also restless, and, you know– I remember feeling this way, but I\u0026rsquo;ve also had a week to recover and they did not give themselves a week to recover. I think– it is, like, occurring to me now that they picked the latest possible day to wake up because they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to give themselves time to stress out about these entities that we\u0026rsquo;re going to meet and this big thing that we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to go do, and so instead they\u0026rsquo;ve given themselves no time to process it.\nAnd- and yeah. My answer is no. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to help you avoid this and do this alone. We\u0026rsquo;re going to do this together, even though that\u0026rsquo;s harder. Which is maybe a little, you know, I think… I don\u0026rsquo;t know that River would call Hill selfish for that, but I think I might say, like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry if that\u0026rsquo;s selfish, but…\u0026rdquo; yeah, I think there is an acknowledgement that like yes, that is partially selfish on my part, and also, that\u0026rsquo;s maybe okay, you know. That I\u0026rsquo;m doing the right thing for not-noble reasons. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it the wrong thing.\nUm… yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m just imagining like that they spend a lot of the afternoon, like, talking and crying and trying to work through, like, all of this anxiety and fear that River is feeling.\nAnd River is the performer. River is, like, the onstage person and Hill is the more behind the scenes person. And I think they\u0026rsquo;re not used to this, like– not quite role reversal but this, like, River\u0026rsquo;s afraid and I\u0026rsquo;m being the quote unquote brave one. Or- or, you know, the bold one, at least.\nYeah, yeah, oof. We spend the afternoon crying it out and talking it out and… knowing all that, let\u0026rsquo;s roll evening and see where that takes us.\nEVENING SATAH: [Die clattering] Evening. Eighteen. Fireworks again in the cupola. Ah, I do kind of wish I\u0026rsquo;d gotten something different, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want to reroll. I think I just want to stick with that.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s probably another picnic with that group of people who I\u0026rsquo;ve met on the ship, right? And I think that there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a pleasant jolt that I have when I realise that the number of people who I\u0026rsquo;ve met on this ship and have some sort of positive connection to is now big enough to fill, like, three big blankets as we\u0026rsquo;re all sitting here, eating stuff from the food truck, watching the fireworks.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re, like, exchanging as much contact information as we can and there are some goodbye moments but then I think at a certain point someone is like, \u0026ldquo;Alright! That portion of the evening is over. From now on, we\u0026rsquo;re just in this moment. Let\u0026rsquo;s just be together.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re all like, \u0026ldquo;[Complaining noises] Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s hard, but okay.\u0026rdquo; We relax into it and it just ends up being a really lovely evening.\nJAM: That is a seven for the evening. Okay. [Laughs] Evening: \u0026ldquo;a group of strangers is going for a night swim in the dive-in theater in the gymnasium block.\u0026rdquo; Dive-in theater instead of drive-in… \u0026ldquo;and they invite you to join them. Do you tag along? What movie is on?\u0026rdquo;\nHmm… oh boy.\nIt is interesting to me if this group of strangers– like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why a group of strangers at this point in the trip would be approaching me to join this. Like, that made sense on my first day out– and maybe if– you know, in part they, like– folks are encouraged, like, whenever folks come out of stasis to, like, invite them to something that day. So this is more an invitation for River?\nThough I was going to say, this is maybe my, like, skyline trivia friends, um, who, uh– no– like– have noticed– like, were excited to meet my friend who\u0026rsquo;s coming out of stasis today, um, and yeah. Like, that- that- that framing as a group of strangers is interesting for- for me, for it to be that group, because now that I have an actual friend here, that, like. Yeah. Those people are strangers. You know, we, like, spent one afternoon together but we don\u0026rsquo;t actually know each other.\nI think they invite both of us to join them. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I go. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think River goes. Uh, you know, this is a kind gesture that again, like, is not- is not the vibe.\nWhat movie is on? The Iron Giant. We don\u0026rsquo;t see it. We\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to, but not this time.\nWe, like, I think– instead, have a dinner together.\nI think about bringing them to different places. I think about bringing them to the garden. I don\u0026rsquo;t, you know– I don\u0026rsquo;t– but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to force anything on them. And so I\u0026rsquo;m– yeah.\nI think it– River is– I think Hill might have been more interested in going to see– going for a swim, at least, if not staying for a whole movie. But they\u0026rsquo;re following River\u0026rsquo;s lead, and yeah. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to the Dive-In Theatre.\nGF: It\u0026rsquo;s once again \u0026ldquo;sleepaway night at the museum block,\u0026rdquo; but, uh, I decide I\u0026rsquo;ve had enough of Reagan. You know? I… had weird dreams while I was there. I dreamt of an America of fire and brimstone. I dreamt of American carnage. I dreamt of bad things happening to good people. And frankly, I don\u0026rsquo;t need that. And neither do you.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

Let\u0026rsquo;s wrap up our time on the Terran Colony Ships and disembark at our… [Chuckles] various intergalactic cultural exchanges.\nGAME: DAY SEVEN (CONT\u0026rsquo;D) DEAD OF NIGHT JAM: Okay. Boy, it\u0026rsquo;s almost over. Um…\nSATAH: And in the dead of night… [Die clattering] Ten. \u0026ldquo;The fusion reactor shut down temporarily for routine maintenance. The ship\u0026rsquo;s black hole drive supplies emergency power. Strange happenings occur around the ship. What unearthly things do you see and where?\u0026rdquo;\nYeah! This is where the having-seen-Solaris-last-night kicks in.\nWell, I love this too because this means that I get home from the picnic and I\u0026rsquo;m already in bed and then I get a knock on the door and it\u0026rsquo;s my childhood friend and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Hey. I know that you gotta be up early tomorrow, but… the reactor\u0026rsquo;s going down for maintenance and I\u0026rsquo;m turning the backup generator on. Do you want to see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m, like, already out of bed. You know? And throwing on clothes.\nAnd she shows me, like, how it spins up. She gestures to a bunch of stuff that I barely understand and I think she\u0026rsquo;s much better at explaining things, but it just is all happening so fast that there\u0026rsquo;s only so much that I can pick up.\nAnd I think there\u0026rsquo;s probably a moment where I do have this incredible clarity and understanding of what\u0026rsquo;s happening and I am like, \u0026ldquo;Whoa, I– I get it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she, like, smiles this huge, like– and her eyes are just sparkling like th– she is so thrilled. I think that this process is a little dangerous. It is not, like– there are enough safeguards in place that nothing catastrophic can happen, but it still is a little bit dangerous to spool this thing up. And she clearly loves that. This is clearly a very, very exciting part of her job to her.\nAnd– and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh wait, I– I get it. Why do I get it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she grins and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have to let me know if you still get it tomorrow. \u0026lsquo;Cause sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s permanent. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s not,\u0026rdquo; and just gestures at the black hole and I become aware that like I have been gifted knowledge in some way.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Oh shit.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think that what this is is like– she makes sure everything is stable and then she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Pretty much everyone is asleep. I gotta go make,\u0026rdquo; like, \u0026ldquo;I gotta do my rounds,\u0026rdquo; you know, similar to when we were walking around measuring stuff before. But she\u0026rsquo;s just making sure that the power is going where it should, when it should, as the fusion reactor is being maintained. And so she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Come on my rounds with me. And keep your eyes open.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think I see a bunch of small things that would be scary. But I am being shown them in the company of somebody who is so obviously enthused by them that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to be scared. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to not just be excited and- and awed and- and- in- and- and find them kind of wondrous, kind of, like– like she does.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s– she\u0026rsquo;s using that- that- you know, uh, keychain pen light a lot. Where… we start to go through a door– or I start to go through a door and she grabs my hand and pulls me back and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;One sec,\u0026rdquo; and shines the light on it and it glows. And she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Not a real door. Let\u0026rsquo;s find the real door,\u0026rdquo; and starts putting her hand on the wall and finds the real door.\nAnd I ask, like, \u0026ldquo;What would have happened if we\u0026rsquo;d gone through there?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she says, \u0026ldquo;Well, probably nothing. Maybe everything. But regardless, it would put me behind schedule. Do you want to go in?\u0026rdquo; And I just shake my head. And she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Okay… well, I\u0026rsquo;m going to ask you again when we see the next one. \u0026lsquo;Cause at some point you might want to go in.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m just like, \u0026ldquo;O-okay. Okay.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think– I\u0026rsquo;m imagining, like, I see ghostly figures. The image I have is just, you know, waltz– waltzing. Ghosts waltzing. I think… I see… crystals growing in the corners of the corridors.\nI see… at one point I gasp in- in- in horror and- and fear because we walk in and it looks like we\u0026rsquo;ve just walked into the vacuum of space and then realise like, this is, like, a vision of the past when the ship was still under construction. You can see, like, the temporary support beams and everything around it while it was being built.\nAnd at one point there\u0026rsquo;s a vision of the future that I don\u0026rsquo;t totally– I can\u0026rsquo;t totally comprehend and- and she says something softly to herself, like, \u0026ldquo;Ah… looks like it\u0026rsquo;s really solidifying.\u0026rdquo; And I look at her and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I mean, the future isn\u0026rsquo;t set. But this one sure is coming up a lot now.\u0026rdquo; And I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to ask her what that means before we\u0026rsquo;re onto the next thing.\nAnd yeah! Just see– strange animals. Aliens. See us as kids, maybe. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of cute.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just this surreal walking tour of oddities. And then I think that I- I stay with her the whole time that the black hole drive is up and we\u0026rsquo;re just walking around, occasionally, like, stopping back in to that room, making sure that everything\u0026rsquo;s still good, walking to another part of the ship.\nAnd she looks at me at a certain point. She\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, at this point, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if what you\u0026rsquo;re seeing is because of the generator or because you\u0026rsquo;re hallucinating from exhaustion.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I like, yawn, laugh guiltily. I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;No, no, no, it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s okay.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, well, they\u0026rsquo;re about to finish anyway, so how about we go back? I\u0026rsquo;ll turn everything off and then I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you back to your room.\u0026rdquo; And I agree. And she does that.\nAnd… why not? Just for fun? She comes to my room with me and we hook up and she stays the night. And I think she has to get up super, super early anyway. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if she sleeps a lot? And I think she makes a passing comment of like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t need to anymore.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, okay, well, \u0026ldquo;You are going to need to tell me more about that at some point,\u0026rdquo; and she, like, shrugs.\nAnd then I have to, like– she gets up and heads off to do whatever her strange businesses– business is. And I head to wherever I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to go to, like, muster to to head down to Mars.\nGF: Once again, \u0026ldquo;the insomniacs and the volunteer kitchen staff\u0026rdquo; are- are up and at \u0026rsquo;em.\nSince it\u0026rsquo;s the last night on the ship, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to order myself a kind of a last meal that\u0026rsquo;s going to include some aquabacon, um, some chik\u0026rsquo;n eggs– chickens spelled C H I K apostrophe N… basically, I\u0026rsquo;m going to order myself a grand slam. A grand slam breakfast. That I\u0026rsquo;m going to eat in the middle of the night.\nUm, aquabacon, chik\u0026rsquo;n eggs, mmm… galactic waffles, galactic home fries, galactic gravy… mmmm… galactic gravy.\nJAM: What are we doing in the dead of night? That\u0026rsquo;s a 17. I… have not rerolled at all in this game. It is again sleepaway night at the museum block. I am going to, I think, for the first time, reroll, um because I don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand this prompt, um, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want the last one to be just like, \u0026ldquo;I skipped this too.\u0026rdquo; Though you know, I may reroll something– I mean, if I reroll, I may roll something else that is also like, \u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;m spending time with River. I\u0026rsquo;m not doing this.\u0026rdquo;\nI rolled an 18, which is again sleepaway night.\nI think what I\u0026rsquo;m getting from those rolls is that, like, people are still trying to, like, cheer us up and- and really press us to, like, \u0026ldquo;You know, we\u0026rsquo;re doing a sleepover for the last night! You should really come!\u0026rdquo;\nUm… do we go? … No! I mean, no. No, I\u0026rsquo;m rolling again. I\u0026rsquo;m rolling again.\nThat is a four. \u0026ldquo;Directories show a lone occupant in the crow\u0026rsquo;s nest cupola. Would you go see who they are? Who are they? What kind of emotional state might they be in?\u0026rdquo; Huh! \u0026ldquo;Directories show a lone occupant.\u0026rdquo; So, like, somebody– I assume that has to mean somebody who\u0026rsquo;s living there. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m checking the directory for where people are residing and there\u0026rsquo;s somebody who\u0026rsquo;s living in the cupola. Um, or [Different pronunciation] cupola. Or [Different pronunciation] cupola.\nGF \u0026amp; SATAH: [Reverb-y clips of pronouncing \u0026ldquo;cupola\u0026rdquo; in varying ways with varying levels of confidence, then text to speech voices in a number of different accents saying \u0026ldquo;Cupola: noun. A vaulted roof or ceiling.\u0026rdquo;]\nJAM: Um… I mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t– it\u0026rsquo;s– you know. Hill has been so focused on River on this day. But yeah– maybe I have lost track of- of River. Maybe we got separated at some point. Like– yeah, people who were- people and the dice were really pressuring us to do the museum sleepover, and that was really not- not it, um, but at some point in, like, those those conversations, or maybe like, one of us went– maybe we both, like, went for a walk to, like, clear our heads and- and were going to meet back up and decide whether or not we were going to do the museum thing, even though we both knew the answer was no.\nUm, and so I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m maybe pulling up a directory because… it occurs to me I don\u0026rsquo;t know where River\u0026rsquo;s actual quarters are? Like, I know where they were– like, what, you know, pod they were in stasis at- like, what- what group of stasis chambers they were in. But, um, I don\u0026rsquo;t know where their actual like sleeping and living quarters are, um, and so I\u0026rsquo;m pulling up the directory to look for them and instead seeing this lone occupant in the cupola that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a name attached.\nAnd… \u0026ldquo;would you go see who they are?\u0026rdquo; Yeah, I mean, I think I do. It does occur to me that it could be River. If maybe, like, for the folks who woke up super late, they ran out of regular rooms.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is. I think they have a regular room. I think up in the cupola is somebody who, um… who also came out of stasis late. I think that is, like, part of the situation is somebody– it\u0026rsquo;s somebody else who just got out of stasis today and got assigned to the crow\u0026rsquo;s nest because they maybe, like me, were not planning to wake up this late. Like, there were a few, like, paperwork errors early on in the trip that meant a few people got woken up later than expected. And for this person, it means, like, the room that they thought was going to be available to them is not and so they got bumped into- into the crow\u0026rsquo;s nest.\nAnd yeah, I show up and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, just like looking for my friend.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What emotional state are they in?\u0026rdquo; I think, like– they- they are maybe someone who was supposed to wake up at, like, the same time as me, and so they\u0026rsquo;ve, like, missed out on a week and are not, like, afraid in the way that River is feeling– not- not, like, anxious in that way, but are feeling, like, really unhappy and, you know, like they missed out on- on so much. Not necessarily the stuff going out around– going on around the ship.\nBut I think maybe they were given a few options for where they could stay given that their, like, selected room was not available, um and they chose the Crow\u0026rsquo;s Nest Cupola because they felt like they missed out on being in space and and want to spend as much time as they can, like, looking- looking at the stars and planets and- and, you know, trying to feel the reality of- of where they are, even though they only have, like, less than 24 hours now, when they thought they were gonna have a whole week.\nSo I think we– yeah. I show up looking for my friend. I chat with this person for a little while. And yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s maybe a little bit of melancholy, but they– they\u0026rsquo;re upset about the- the journey. And- and River is upset about the- the destination.\nI think– yeah. And I think having- having sat and chatted with this person for a little bit and maybe, like, spending a few minutes just looking out at the stars with them. And, um, yeah, just trying to be present in- in space and- and having spent, like, all day being- being emotional support for- for River– and I think this new person is not necessarily looking for that from me, um, but yeah. I think Hill is just looking out at- at space and- and trying to clear their head a little bit before they go back and look for River again.\nAnd I think since this is dead of night, when I do track down River\u0026rsquo;s chambers, they\u0026rsquo;re already asleep. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re– they were exhausted. They– you know. Their- their sleep schedule is- is wonky and- and they had, like, a really intense stressful day. So they went– they went back– I think, like, when we went for that little walk where we decided what we were going to do, they just went straight back to their chambers and, like, passed out immediately.\nAnd I think for this last night, um… I imagine people probably have… just trying to imagine what the- the sleeping situation is like.\nI think Hill chooses to sleep here rather than their own sleeping chamber. I think they either, like– I don\u0026rsquo;t know that their relationship with River is close enough to, like, crawl into bed with them. But they either sleep on the floor next to them, or, um, if they do have like a roommate or, you know, somebody with the bed next door, um– I\u0026rsquo;ll- I\u0026rsquo;ll talk to them and ask them to swap with me so that I can be here when River wakes up.\nHoo.\nAnd that was night of this last day. And so now…\nDISEMBARKATION GF: It\u0026rsquo;s arrival day.\nJAM: Part five: the arrival.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;The game ends when every day in the trip duration has passed. The ship arrives at its destination and the disembarkation process begins.\u0026rdquo;\nJAM: So what\u0026rsquo;s interesting is I feel like a lot of these– I haven\u0026rsquo;t read the arrival bit of the game before now, and I feel like a lot of the prompts here are suited towards a game where we were evacuated from Earth or it became unlivable, and less for this sort of voluntary mission.\nUm, and I wonder, like, what the duration of our stay is? Because I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is like– we did- have not agreed to move permanently to space. To Saturn. Or to you know, a home– I\u0026rsquo;m imagining that it is a- a– some sort of base orbiting Saturn that we and our new friends built collaboratively. Or at least built a part of it that can, like, dock into each other, so we both have, like, an environment suited specifically to us where we can live.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Decide the fate of the ship. It can be decommissioned and set on display, scrapped for materials or anything in between.\u0026rdquo;\nGF: The TCS Lone Ranger is going to stay right where it is. We are going to be here for the next two months doing this cultural exchange, but after that, the passengers who got onto the TCS Lone Ranger are going to get right back on and head back.\nJAM: I think the ship is our home base that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be orbiting Saturn in. It is going to be switching from sort of travel mode to orbit mode and it\u0026rsquo;s going to be docking with the extraterrestrial ship and is going to be a, like, semi-permanent home base here.\nI think this massive cultural exchange… we\u0026rsquo;ve agreed to stay for, like, at least six months to a year. I think after six months, folks have the option to… like, there are some probably smaller ships on board with stasis chambers and like, yeah, are not the sort of massive, like, with all of these VR and- and you know different environments and a museum and things, um– a more sort of basic travel ship with a cafeteria and stasis and- and. you know, a few, like comfortable– probably a garden for, you know, food and oxygen and- and like mental well being. Um, but yeah, just- just smaller ships that will disembark six months from now. Will start disembarking and there\u0026rsquo;s like a few different chances to- to leave.\nSATAH: The bigger ship, Magnitude, the TCS Magnitude, keeps going on its slow orbit. Whatever it\u0026rsquo;s up to. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s actually a very, very fast orbit, but space is big. [Laughs] Um.\nThe smaller ship, the ship that we were initially sent up in? The, like, essentially, like, close to shipping container, is built purposefully to be scrapped. Like, it is the kind of thing that is built for a one way trip, so that you can arrive on a planet, land safely, and then take it apart to build homes and that kind of thing out of.\nJAM: The next direction is, \u0026ldquo;Choose a name for your new home. Anything goes, but every player has to agree.\u0026rdquo; So, it is just me.\nSATAH: It already kind of has– it has a name, right? Like… because I\u0026rsquo;m setting up a place for humans– and I guess our little village could have a name?\nJAM: Yeah, so- so the Ada is our- our home base, I think. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we are changing the name of the Ada, or combining it– like, hyphenating it with whatever the- the extraterrestrial base that we\u0026rsquo;re connecting with is. And what their language is like. There\u0026rsquo;s so– there\u0026rsquo;s, you know– yeah.\nWell, and maybe Ada was the name of- of it in travel mode. You know, it was more the name of the mission, and now that it\u0026rsquo;s, like, the base, it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s named after something else. Like, things are named after poets when they are in motion, and when they are in orbit, they take on something else. That\u0026rsquo;s interesting.\nI think especially if, yeah, the ship is like transforming significantly, so that it is like, lose- take- you know, removing pieces of it that it needed for transit, um, docking and, like, you know– I\u0026rsquo;m sure, like, the engineer team is, like, all hands on deck connecting us to this other ship and- and transforming in that way. Yeah, it is- it is going to be a very different– it\u0026rsquo;s going to be very similar on the inside part where I\u0026rsquo;m living, but very different in a lot of ways.\nAnd so what is it named after?\nSATAH: So if the big ship was called Magnitude, what was our delivery ship called? \u0026lsquo;Cause we\u0026rsquo;ll probably just name it after that. And I think I said something about like the idea that ships are often named after, like, feelings that they want to be, like, evoked, of, like, vastness and awe.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s look at relatedwords.io. \u0026ldquo;Magnitude.\u0026rdquo; Significance is actually fun. I\u0026rsquo;m also going to look up… synonyms for \u0026ldquo;awe\u0026rdquo;. Knock one socks off. That\u0026rsquo;s so funny. The idea that slowly we\u0026rsquo;ll run out of names and start having those type of aphorisms or whatever. Very great.\nThis is definitely difficult with how many words meaning, like, big and amazing have mutated in the English language to be something negative.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s call it The Significance. Is that too ostentatious for a cultural exchange?\nOoh, if it\u0026rsquo;s a feeling we want to evoke in this context, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s something about, like, fellowship, uhh, or collaboration or something like that. Communion has a certain religiosity to it at this point that I don\u0026rsquo;t think… [Gasps] rapprochement! I like that. I like that a lot.\nSo our smaller ship, the delivery ship, was called the TCS Rapprochement. And so we just name our little settlement, uh– it probably just gets called, like, Rappo, which is in part because, like, the- the part of the ship that gets turned into something that has the name on it ended up being retrofitted to whatever we\u0026rsquo;re using it for in a certain way where as you\u0026rsquo;re approaching our little human living area, you see R-A-P-P-O, Rappo. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we call it.\nJAM: Ships in motion are poets. What is a ship in orbit? Or a ship serving as, like, a station or home base? What do we name those after?\nI feel like I want to go with, like, an animal home name, like the nest or the dam or um… the lodge sounds very silly to me. I was thinking about beavers.\nUm… mm. Mhm!!\nI think, yeah, just maybe named after an Earth environs. And since this is a fairly large one and a fairly permanent one, it\u0026rsquo;s not named after, like, an animal home. It\u0026rsquo;s named after, like, a forest or a mountain. But it\u0026rsquo;s, like, a fairly large one, like, named after a biome rather than, like, a specific place on Earth.\nYeah, I mean, I think it\u0026rsquo;s just called The Woodland. Like, you know, it is a name that maybe doesn\u0026rsquo;t make logical sense from the outside, but it\u0026rsquo;s just like, this is how we name places that are going to be permanent homes for humans in space. We named them after a biome like this. And this one is The Woodland.\nGF: Our home with the Aquamanias is called Awkworth. [\u0026ldquo;Awkward\u0026rdquo; tone] Awkworth! Awkworth.\nSATAH: Yeah! So, then, \u0026ldquo;Say your farewells or farewell for nows, say nothing, stick together or drift apart.\u0026rdquo; Did that, basically, with a bunch of people on the ship. And at this point, I\u0026rsquo;m getting to know, for the first time, a lot of the people who I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to be living with.\nGF: I say goodbye to some of the people that I saw on the ship. Juno Zorander, Jago Tudor, Dr. Zhao. But the last person I see before I really pack up my stuff and head towards my, uh… my cultural exchange billets, where I\u0026rsquo;m going to be staying is… I find my wordless friend. My sad, crying wordless friend who I saw in the engine room for a couple of nights.\nThey seem much less upset now that we\u0026rsquo;re here. I think this kind of travel is hard on anybody. Travel in general is hard. You\u0026rsquo;re away from home, you\u0026rsquo;re away from your warm bed, you\u0026rsquo;re away from all of the things that you recognize and that make life good.\nJAM: So I imagine this is if, like, we\u0026rsquo;ve arrived on a new planet and we\u0026rsquo;re settling here, which is, like, not our situation. Yeah, I think we\u0026rsquo;re sticking together. I think River and Hill came into this as, like, colleagues and coworkers who had a good relationship and out of necessity become quite close quite quickly.\nGF: I see my wordless friend there and I give them a big hug. And they give me a big hug back, which is really nice.\nAnd while I\u0026rsquo;m giving them a big hug, I actually start crying a little bit. But as I start crying, they take one of my hands off of their shoulder and they just hold it gently.\nJAM: The actual day that we disembark, the day that we dock and are scheduled to meet our new friends for the first time, River wakes up with Hill, like, on their floor, or on the bed next to them and is grateful, and, um. Yeah, I mean, has the calm of someone who had– who had to go through the big freak out. And is still not happy about the next step but knows that that\u0026rsquo;s what has to happen.\nI feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely experienced that, both myself and, like, in people I\u0026rsquo;ve supported where we just had to we had to go through the, like, the freaking out and the reflexive like, \u0026ldquo;I absolutely can\u0026rsquo;t do this. Don\u0026rsquo;t make me do this,\u0026rdquo; and moving through that, and then putting on brave face and being like, \u0026ldquo;Okay.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs] Think of like, okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll go to the hospital, or you know, okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll start therapy. And in this case, okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll meet the aliens.\nGF: Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how far away from Earth you are, sometimes all you need is just someone to hold your hand while you cry it out a little bit.\nJAM: \u0026ldquo;Decide how you\u0026rsquo;ll spend your time. The settlement has all the same amenities as the ship. All of your time is free time.\u0026rdquo; That makes some sense to some extent. That we– that, you know, they have not like scheduled events for for after we meet our new friends. That they\u0026rsquo;ve scheduled up to then and- and then we\u0026rsquo;re figuring out what that will look like as it happens. Which is also, you know, super scary.\nGF: This trip really hasn\u0026rsquo;t felt as long as I thought it would. They really have sort of thought of everything, quote unquote. That\u0026rsquo;s actually one of the slogans of the United Space Travel Associations of Earth is, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve thought of everything!\u0026rdquo;\nThey\u0026rsquo;ve thought of everything to make these trips as tolerable as possible due to all of the– what with all of the insanity of the, uh, of the previous trips.\nJAM: The way that it\u0026rsquo;s been scheduled is like to not overwhelm us or overwhelm them. It is not, like, we open the doors and three hundred of them meet three hundred of us at once. That would be so wild.\nI think that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of different, like, quote unquote \u0026ldquo;arts\u0026rdquo; represented on the ship. So there\u0026rsquo;s like linguists who go, there\u0026rsquo;s, um… folks… yeah, folks who go first to either specialise in communication cross-culturally or have specifically spent time studying extraterrestrial forms of life.\nAnd- and yeah, then yeah, we\u0026rsquo;re I\u0026rsquo;m assuming we\u0026rsquo;re meeting in small groups. Um… they put us into breakout rooms. Oh god. [Laughing in horror]\nYeah, they they do that initial meeting with I have to assume a translator or- or something, then, like, slowly over that day and the next couple days, folks start meeting our new friends and- and very like slowly start talking about who– maybe doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak English, but maybe like either knows sign language at this point or- or has another, like, method of nonverbal communication with us.\nI think Hill and River are scheduled to be part of, like, a small group with a few other arts folks. Like maybe some theater– some other theater people have a small group meeting with- with aliens. And yeah, I mean, the only thing that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about is that Hill takes River\u0026rsquo;s hand and is, like, holding it and squeezing it the whole time.\nGF: I really haven\u0026rsquo;t missed home all that much. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be excited to return but I think for now I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to meet up with, uh, the- the Aquamenis from Poseidon. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to get off the TCS Lone Ranger and get my hands on some quartz painting supplies, and I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to see what this cultural exchange is going to be all about. I really want to learn more about the Aquamenis and… and I wanna tell them more about humans.\nJAM: As Hill, I\u0026rsquo;m not thinking about how, you know, a few days before River woke up, I would have been, like, so energized and excited about this meeting. That you know, this was the thing that, like, really lit a spark in me when I was feeling weird about being here. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think– it doesn\u0026rsquo;t– it occurs to me as a player, like on a meta level, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur to Hill to be disappointed about that being the experience. I think, you know, having had the– that- that really rough day with River and, like, still, like, checking in with them now and supporting them now, um… is maybe a better headspace for- for me to be in for this. Like, that- that- that excitement was, like, genuine and sincere but also perhaps slightly naive to be like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, this is another sentient life form and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be so inspired by how weird and different they are.\u0026rdquo; You know, I think it is a healthier spot to be in to be reminded that, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, we\u0026rsquo;re building a relationship here and it\u0026rsquo;s going to be scary and complicated. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to need each other to navigate it.\u0026rdquo; Yeah.\nAnd I think… I\u0026rsquo;m– I- I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much I want to talk through how long we stay. I mean, I think things get better, but they stay complicated. And, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s not any, like, hostility between us and our new friends, and– but there\u0026rsquo;s also, like, days where we\u0026rsquo;re just, you know, where it feels very frustrating. Where it feels like we\u0026rsquo;re not– we spend all day communicating with them and- and don\u0026rsquo;t feel like they\u0026rsquo;ve understood us or we\u0026rsquo;ve understood them. But I think, yeah. I\u0026rsquo;ll close on, like, one of these first days when we\u0026rsquo;re making these initial- initial connections.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m trying like intentionally not to speculate about what they look like and how they behave. I guess I am like in my mind\u0026rsquo;s eye seeing that, like, sort of shadow silhouette, like not quite solid type shape, like, similar to the- the illusion that- that Hill saw on that first night. That there is, like, some kind of resemblance there, but not not exactly the same.\nUm… yeah, I want to close on them pulling out that notebook and initially showing it to the new friends, but then also realising that they haven\u0026rsquo;t shown it to River yet and showing it to them, um, and something in that, like, clicking with- with our new– our new friends. That I have– I have– I don\u0026rsquo;t know that they are able to parse what it is that I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn right away, but, you know, the idea that I made something to communicate an idea, not only to them, but seeing me share it with another human, I think, communicates something to them that that… that yeah, I think would otherwise be hard to articulate. That maybe there is a moment there of both them seeing us in that moment as, like, unique different individuals that don\u0026rsquo;t all share the same experiences and us seeing them the same way.\nYeah, so that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;ll close. We\u0026rsquo;re all- we\u0026rsquo;re all looking at my sketchbook that I\u0026rsquo;ve been keeping over these last several days.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;The settlement has all the same amenities as the ship and is fully automated. All of your time is free time.\u0026rdquo;\nOkay. So I guess… I\u0026rsquo;m like… the way that I was talking about it, it isn\u0026rsquo;t automated yet, right? Because a bunch of development needs to happen. So I think there is a lot of stuff that is automated, but there has to be something for me to do.\nSee, okay, so this is– this is partially a me struggle. Um. When I think of my perfect world, the world that we could create that is kindest to the most of us, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a world without labour. I see a world where labour isn\u0026rsquo;t exploited. Where the people who do it are doing it not under duress and with full ownership in some form or another over the things that they are creating.\nAnd maybe I am discarding the premise slightly when– and maybe it\u0026rsquo;s– it is a symptom of our current world that I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine a fully automated society that is not built off of some amount of exploitation of people or of physical resources.\nI think my association with automation is extraction. And so it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for me to put myself in a place of imagining a world where you do what you want forever and have no responsibilities. Which– I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s strictly what this is saying… \u0026ldquo;all of your time is free time\u0026rdquo; is just, like… that isn\u0026rsquo;t saying, necessarily, that you don\u0026rsquo;t have responsibilities or that there isn\u0026rsquo;t– it IS saying that there isn\u0026rsquo;t work to be done, right? It\u0026rsquo;s fully automated.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t imagine that world because I don\u0026rsquo;t… [Laughs] I mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s possible but that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a– that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a boring way to approach genre fiction, right? But I think– I feel as though it is fair for me to interpret that instead as, like, yes there is work– or there is labour, rather– there are things that have to get done. But for the most part, people do the things that they care about and want to do.\nAnd there is some level of automation for some tasks, for a lot of tasks, that there\u0026rsquo;s no particular reason for a human to be involved in. Absolutely those can be automated. The thing I struggle with there is just what underlies that? What resources were extracted to create that? Are we building that off of the backs of a system like we have now with the– the people in places that are exploited to create our technology or have we evolved to a place where even that, somehow, is done without exploitation? I guess that\u0026rsquo;s totally possible and it was a slow long journey to get there. And maybe this is sort of a fundamental flaw of my own imagination and a certain stubbornness about what is the perfect world? What is the world that I truly think that we deserve? Positive tone on deserve there, by the way.\nYeah. So it isn\u0026rsquo;t totally fully automated but we are building those systems and at some point in the past thousand years we have developed technologies and systems in a direction that means that there isn\u0026rsquo;t fresh blood on the hands of every iPhone and algorithm that we use. That\u0026rsquo;s always going to be in the history of those things if that– if this world is built off of our world now, then somewhere in the background of that, there is blood. But in this fiction we have created a version where there isn\u0026rsquo;t– all of that blood is is old and it\u0026rsquo;s a- it\u0026rsquo;s a history, and people don\u0026rsquo;t bleed for it anymore. And… we can build something that is truly beautiful that honours the desires and efforts of the people that build it. And we can do it on Mars, baby!! [Laughings]\nAnd I guess at some point we\u0026rsquo;re gonna meet all the aliens we\u0026rsquo;re gonna talk to them, um, but that\u0026rsquo;s not in the scope of this game. Haha! The aliens were just off screen the whole time. You\u0026rsquo;re not even gonna get to see them. You spend the whole movie being like, \u0026ldquo;Holy shit we\u0026rsquo;re gonna meet aliens at the end of this!\u0026rdquo; No, you don\u0026rsquo;t. It was a story about people and my own complicated feelings to labour, which even as I explain them, I am very aware at all times I have a particular form of daddy issue capitalist brain rot that makes me define myself by the amount of work that I do and specifically the ways that I suffer for it, and so it is impossible for me to fully trust at any point in what I think are my genuine beliefs about the importance of labour and doing the work. I can think about it as much as I want and I can make it fit and- and I can truly believe that I have managed to place this in a context that is outside of that one, but I can\u0026rsquo;t, really. \u0026lsquo;Cause it\u0026rsquo;s– that\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s inside of me.\nAnd that is what it is– like, that is what it\u0026rsquo;s like to live in the world that we do and try to imagine one that is better. And all we can do, really, is hope that we create the best version of the world that we can envision and then the people who grow up in that world can have a better imagination than we do because they are closer to the actually good thing. And then if we just keep iterating on that and making it better… [Laughing with obvious shaking in their voice] then if we survive… [Laughing] sorry, I\u0026rsquo;ve made myself cry! Um! Then that\u0026rsquo;s a way forward. That is– that is a way forward. Is it gonna happen? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But it- it could. There\u0026rsquo;s a world– there\u0026rsquo;s a world where it could. [Sniffling, still laughing]\nJAM: Um, and- and- yeah. Okay. That\u0026rsquo;s it! That\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s the game!\nGF: [Chortles] I hope that you have enjoyed this? I hope that you\u0026rsquo;ve– I hope that you\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed all of the, uh, weird stuff that I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten up to. I hope that you\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed the things, uh, that I– the things that I decided to do and the things that I decided not to do.\nI feel like these– I\u0026rsquo;ve never played a solo game before but I will say that it definitely feels like playing a solo game is like a- an exercise in extreme improv and it feels, uh, especially problematic to kind of, like, \u0026ldquo;no– no, but,\u0026rdquo; myself, rather than \u0026ldquo;yes and\u0026rdquo; myself, um… but, uh, there were just times where I felt like it would be, uh, more appropriate for my character to not do the things that were presented and I guess those were options, so. Um, I\u0026rsquo;m trying not to feel weird about it. It\u0026rsquo;s just those were the options and- and I took those options.\nUm, I\u0026rsquo;m very very happy to have taken the options that I did, though, and, uh, this was an interesting game. I would definitely play it with more people. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if solo games are for me, beyond perhaps doing them in- in a kind of, like, performing kind of way like this? Um, but I\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed this, Satah. And anyone else listening. I really enjoyed this.\nSATAH: [Laughing \u0026amp; still sniffling a bit while talking] Sorry that I exist as, um, uh, a parody of a leftist in a conservative political cartoon that I literally made myself– made myself cry talking, uh, vaguely about the revolution while playing a tabletop role playing game.\nI think that that is in the purview of this game. This game makes people– this game wants you to think about stuff.\nGF: I hope you\u0026rsquo;re all doing well out there in this reality that we\u0026rsquo;re living in which is… really seems to get more and more challenging by the day. Um, and I hope wherever you are that you\u0026rsquo;re safe and that you\u0026rsquo;re happy.\nJAM: Uh, yeah. And as we\u0026rsquo;re– as- as I close on this moment of, like, this act of of sharing and this act of care and this active communication that helps illuminate our new friends to us and us to our new friends, um, I\u0026rsquo;ll just read the last line of this Ada Limón poem that the- the young person that I work with shared with me, which is…\n\u0026ldquo;We, too, are made of wonders, of great\nand ordinary loves, of small invisible worlds,\nof a need to call out through the dark.\u0026rdquo;\nGF: This is garbageface aka the gnostic front, signing off.\nJAM: Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s it!

DRAW! INTRO SATAH: Welcome to Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs. I am your host, Satah. My goal is to showcase multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together. You can support the show financially at patreon.com/foliopod, or join as a free member to get access to the bonus podcast feed, which will shortly include alternate playthroughs of this very game. One should be up at the time of posting this episode, and the other will go out later in April.\nToday we are playing My Turn! Draw!, a \u0026ldquo;hopepunk narrative prompt -based RPG about building insurmountable odds but always finding a way to prevail with a dramatic flair\u0026rdquo; by Jacky Leung.\nThe other Duelist of Destiny facing off against fate alongside me today is Steph Novak.\nMy Turn! Draw! uses card combos as moves to narrate you, the Duelist of Destiny, struggling to overcome attacks from– but eventually triumphing over– the Duelist of Fate. Fate plays the cards against you. If you have a card of exactly the same value in your hand, which are called Destiny cards, you can straightforwardly resolve Fate\u0026rsquo;s action. As the book says, \u0026ldquo;balance and harmony quell Fate,\u0026rdquo; and Fate\u0026rsquo;s action against you is perfectly countered. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a card of the same value, you can attempt to resolve Fate\u0026rsquo;s card with a Destiny card of higher or lower value, creating more complications, or you can play from a list of other actions like Resonate, where you play two cards from your hand– two Destiny cards– treating the difference between them as the resolution value, then \u0026ldquo;narrate how you resolve fate with acceptance.\u0026rdquo;\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t really wrap my head around the mechanics until I actually played the game, and I fell in love with them. As you\u0026rsquo;ll hear, I actually played it twice in a row, as did Steph.\nI do want to note that the PDF is labeled as version 0 .5, so it might not be the creator\u0026rsquo;s final vision of the game, but even if these are just the bones, oh boy, it is a wonderful skeleton. Steph and I both told very goofy, high stakes, low seriousness stories, and I\u0026rsquo;m super grateful that this game could facilitate that. It\u0026rsquo;s something I absolutely love that I think you don\u0026rsquo;t get a lot of in solo games, which… have a tendency to be, uh, very emotionally heavy? Which of course has its place and is wonderful, but oh wow, it\u0026rsquo;s so nice to just sit down and do something fun and goofy– and also pretty quick, which is a huge treat in TTRPGs. So quick, in fact, that this– as a Folio first– is a single episode series. This is the first and final episode, so let\u0026rsquo;s just get into it.\nGAME: SET-UP SATAH: Okay.\nSTEPH: Alright, hey!\nSATAH: So.\nSTEPH: Let\u0026rsquo;s play some My Turn! Draw!\nSATAH: In what is a first for Folio, I just recorded a game of this and then at the very end realised that I had totally fumbled the ending mechanic in a way that was kind of, um, unrecoverable! And so this is the second time that I\u0026rsquo;m playing this game. And I\u0026rsquo;m just going to release the other one as bonus content because I think that it was really fun, but I did mess up a fairly core mechanic of the game enough that I was like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t love that as a a representation of the game.\u0026rdquo; So! Let\u0026rsquo;s do it again.\n[Shuffling cards in the background] This was my trial of of fate and destiny Luckily, I found out this game seems to go very quickly, which is why I don\u0026rsquo;t feel too bad about doing it again. My last game came in at about 45 minutes and it\u0026rsquo;s going to edit down to considerably less than that, I imagine.\nSTEPH: I think we\u0026rsquo;ll start off with concept here, because it is very simple: what if you got Jumanjied with Candyland? Or maybe reverse Jumanjied? Whatever. Candyland is real now, um, and you get through it as you always do, by drawing cards.\nSATAH: SoI think that I really found while I was playing the other one that I struggled a bit with not knowing, um, what exactly the game is that– like, the form of dueling that I\u0026rsquo;m doing. So I am going to choose that up front.\nUh, obviously it could just be doing Yu-Gi-Oh, or a serial numbers filed off card monster game, but I think… at one point I kind of just had the specific image from Scott Pilgrim of the like battle of the bands and I think I want to do an amalgam of the two where… I am involved in an underground music battle scene. Where it is a battle of the bands but our sounds create monsters to fight each other.\nSTEPH: Uh, with this in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s answer some setup questions, shall we?\nSATAH: So for the setup, in classic me fashion, I am going to answer the questions by rolling on the potential answers that they give. There are five results, or five items on each list, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a d6 and ignore sixes.\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;Why are we confronting fate?\u0026rdquo; The fate that consigned us to existence in Candyland? Um, I think \u0026ldquo;someone is counting on me and I must succeed.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Why do you confront fate?\u0026rdquo; [Die clatters] Got a one. \u0026ldquo;I have something to prove and I aim to be the best.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: Hmm… wo would be counting on me in this situation? My brain has unfortunately gone, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s all the other little tokens.\u0026rdquo; And hey, yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of friends. We\u0026rsquo;re all in this together. And I am taking point in the Candyland evacuation. So, can\u0026rsquo;t let them down. Absolutely not.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What is your style when you duel against Fate?\u0026rdquo; [Die clattering] Two. \u0026ldquo;Cunning and ambitious: I revel in a challenge and aim for an enormous payoff.\u0026rdquo; Ooh.\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;What is our style when we duel against Fate?\u0026rdquo; I think it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;trusting and dependable.\u0026rdquo; I think that\u0026rsquo;s the move. \u0026ldquo;I remain steadfast in my convictions and believe in something.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: So I think one thing that that looks like, in a music sense, is the heavy use of a loop pedal? Um, I have a habit of, like, it seems like I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to lose because it starts quite slowly, but then escalates to something that is absolutely uncontrollable by the other person and essentially unbeatable.\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;What do I believe in?\u0026rdquo; Heh. Funny you should ask. I believe in A, the power of friendship. And B, the inevitability of a card that will put me way ahead in this game. It\u0026rsquo;s the Queen Frostine card, the one that is farthest along on the Candyland board, uh, and a great way to shorten up games of Candyland with small children. Just stacking that early on the deck. But we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes, I guess. I think trusting and dependable is the move here.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;How did you get into this predicament?\u0026rdquo; [Die clattering]\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;How did we get into this predicament?\u0026rdquo; Or… how are we in that confrontation? Huh.\nSATAH: Three. \u0026ldquo;Fate has manipulated and directed me all along.\u0026rdquo; That immediately gives me the image of, like, the shadowy record exec or whatever lurking in the back of these shows.\nSTEPH: Hmm. Okay. You know what? [Laughs] I feel like I told on myself a little bit in my existing beef with Candyland. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve made a vow of enmity against Fate and followed its trail.\u0026rdquo; I think I may have inadvertently placed myself and my friends, maybe in some sort of Babysitter\u0026rsquo;s Club-style shenaniganery, and we seek to destroy one of the more irritating games to ever exist in the form of Candyland. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that enough is enough, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to learn to play something else. Anything else. Maybe Guess Who?\nSATAH: It seems distinctly possible that part of what\u0026rsquo;s happening here is that like, they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re good.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying not to be too Scott Pilgrim with this, and I kind of forget some of the plot of Scott Pilgrim. So if I rip it off, it\u0026rsquo;s probably largely unintentional.\nBut like, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re good. You should, um, sign to my label without your band and come be a pop star.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;No! I have integrity!\u0026rdquo; Or whatever.\nAnd I think that they\u0026rsquo;ve played on my ambition, right? My style of being cunning and ambitious. They have played on that to sow a little bit of division between my band and I. And been like, \u0026ldquo;Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll be better off.\u0026rdquo;\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;No. I am so strong and love my band.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;And where has Fate brought us?\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Where has Fate brought you?\u0026rdquo; [Die clattering] One: \u0026ldquo;a familiar place from my past, but changed, and not for the better.\u0026rdquo; Ooh!!\nSo first two things that come to mind are, like, the first place I ever played a show or my first rehearsal space? Or maybe even the first rehearsal space with the band?\nSTEPH: Well. It can only have brought us to \u0026ldquo;a mysterious realm where time and space are twisted and warped,\u0026rdquo; by which I mean Candyland Board Real.\nSATAH: And it\u0026rsquo;s like… ohh. It\u0026rsquo;s gone condos or something. It\u0026rsquo;s like… we used to be able– we used to practice in, like, the basement of the record store that our drummer worked at or something like that. And it\u0026rsquo;s still… not- not- not the basement, but like, the back room, because I want the horizon to be basically the same and like seen out the window. And that store has since been… like, first it was bought by a chain, like a music chain. And then it was bought by– it was amalgamated into a different music chain. And then it just died and it got turned into some, like… just some stupid… some shitty business.\nMaybe– no, I was trying to think if it could be something that is like, you know… data banks for AI. That is like– and have this be, like, a morality tale. A tale of, like, your old record space got taken over by this shitty product that is undermining creativity, uh whatever, whatever. But no. I think that\u0026rsquo;s too abstract. It\u0026rsquo;s more fun if it just got turned into, like, the equivalent of, like, a too-fancy weed store that looks like an Apple store. Um.\nMaybe just bougie clothes. Oh, yeah, because– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s totally bougie clothes, because during the course of this show, leading up to this final duel, you\u0026rsquo;ve seen, like, us making our own merch and uniforms and all that kind of stuff, and especially when we were first rehearsing.\nWe are in our first regular rehearsal space, but either what it is now, or what it might be in the future..? Probably what it is now, but amplified. So it\u0026rsquo;s like this shitty chain store of generic too-expensive clothes and just no speck of our stupid punky sensibility around it.\nAnd I think that like… it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where I get brought and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Look. Isn\u0026rsquo;t this better?\u0026rdquo; This being the record exec.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;What?! No! This is disgusting! There\u0026rsquo;s not even a little bit of individuality left in it! Look at these drones in their t-shirts!!\u0026rdquo;\nOr whatever.\nSTEPH: My friends and I, presumably we are teens of some flavor. You know, we\u0026rsquo;re in high school. We need gas money. We\u0026rsquo;re babysitting. The game of choice, far too often, is Candyland. And frankly, enough is enough.\nWe made some choices. We took action to kind of wipe Candyland off the map. Because it\u0026rsquo;s a miserable game and children never seem to get sick of it as much as we wish they would.\nAnd in doing so, we have encountered the final boss: the greatest step in destruction of Candyland as a concept, which is of course Candyland itself. Defying destruction. Continuing on in various iterations for decades. And who knows, maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll be the ones to finally pull it off.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s, uh– let\u0026rsquo;s- let\u0026rsquo;s grab some cards. That seems like a pretty good setup.\nSTEPH: So let\u0026rsquo;s deal five cards to ourselves from the top of the deck.\nSATAH: That is going to be my Destiny hand. And now I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw five cards from the bottom of the deck, which I find so physically difficult to do. Two, three, four…\nSTEPH: There\u0026rsquo;s five.\nSATAH: This is the line of Fate. Let\u0026rsquo;s reveal the first Fate card.\nSTEPH: Alright, \u0026ldquo;reveal one Fate card from the line of Fate.\u0026rdquo; Absolutely. \u0026ldquo;Based on your answers, tailor the theme of the Fate card and narrate the starting situation. Remember that you\u0026rsquo;re in peril.\u0026rdquo;\nI think the peril is just having to deal with Candyland more. Or drowning in the peanut butter swamp. One of the two. Equally horrific ends to things.\nSATAH: The four of clubs.\nSTEPH: So our starting card is the six of clubs.\nSATAH: Clubs are \u0026ldquo;a fate of danger and suspense.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;A fate of danger and suspense.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;A fate of arrogance and ignorance clouds your path.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;A fate of arrogance and ignorance cloud your path.\u0026rdquo; Which seems fitting. The game utterly devoid of excitement now suddenly filled with a worthwhile sense of tension and arrogance.\nSATAH: And four is sort of the- the most usual answer. Card values from two to nine all get the fate prompt of \u0026ldquo;chains of Fate continually seek to bind you.\u0026rdquo; So basically just, like, Fate\u0026rsquo;s going to keep trying to beat you, to keep you down.\nAnd I think what this means for the starting thing… I think danger and suspense, I want to take literally. I get suspended in the air. And I think that the thing that– because I\u0026rsquo;m in mortal peril, basically. I\u0026rsquo;m in peril as we start here. And the, like, arrogance– I can see, like, the record exec is still trying to convince me to abandon my band for real and join her and come be a famous pop star. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t that what you really want? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that what\u0026rsquo;s most important to you?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the thing that\u0026rsquo;s arrogant here is that, like, I don\u0026rsquo;t counter that in the moment by being like, \u0026ldquo;No, that isn\u0026rsquo;t what\u0026rsquo;s most important to me.\u0026rdquo; I say like, \u0026ldquo;I can get famous without you. I don\u0026rsquo;t need you. We don\u0026rsquo;t need you.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she does like a, \u0026ldquo;Tch. Heh. Well, we\u0026rsquo;ll see about that.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: Have you ever seen someone over the age of, like, 10 in the face of Candyland? It\u0026rsquo;s nothing but arrogance. Especially when you can distract a toddler into looking away so you can stack the deck and make a game quick and relatively painless.\nAnd card value two to nine: \u0026ldquo;chains of Fate continually seek to bind you.\u0026rdquo; And I think this manifests in…\nOur eyes open. My eyes open. And see, horror of all horrors: a gingerbread tree before us. Smiling. It\u0026rsquo;s got little jelly bean apples on it. There\u0026rsquo;s Plumpy the Gumdrop, seated under it. Grinning, foolishly, happily, joyous to see us. No concept of what we\u0026rsquo;ve come here to do. Our grand undertaking. But that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Because we\u0026rsquo;ll get them when they least expect it. Though they might come to expect it, and we\u0026rsquo;ll just keep on trying anyway. It\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Spotlight, dear?\u0026rdquo; The, like, ground that I\u0026rsquo;ve been standing on raises really fast up into the air and a spotlight goes on me and I am, like, suspended in midair as we begin– like, on a- on a platform that is, like, dangling or whatever.\nSTEPH: In what we can only describe as a sort of Wizard of Oz moment, there is a brick road before us. Colourful, bright. I think this one might be made of chocolate or some sort of brittle. And in multiple colours, not just yellow, but such is the point of the game.\nPile of cards lies before us. The only way to win is by playing. And so we must play.\nSATAH: Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s how we begin. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to turn one.\nBREAK SATAH: Just a quick interruption here because Steph is magnanimous enough to bring this level of heat to the show with no desire to drop any plugs, but I am not this way.\nFirst of all, you\u0026rsquo;re currently listening to my show! Thank you. Check out gaygothvibes.online to see some of my other work in games and in music. I released an EP at the end of last year, made a full-length album for record production month in February. You can get them on Bandcamp or listen to them pretty much wherever you rent your music. And, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, give me a shout if you need an editor for your TTRPG or your podcast!\nAnd now, it\u0026rsquo;s time to see how our Duelists of Destiny ultimately prevail over the Duelists of Fate in their climactic battle.\nGAME CONT\u0026rsquo;D SATAH: So every turn, you can take one action. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the actions and let\u0026rsquo;s see what my hand is looking like.\nSTEPH: Let\u0026rsquo;s check out our cards.\nSATAH: So basically the ideal thing is that you can resolve Fate cards by playing a card that is the exact same value as it? If you play a card that isn\u0026rsquo;t the exact same value, then either it\u0026rsquo;s unresolved and it stays there on the line of Fate or you end up drawing a new one. Barring that, you can play something that is the same suit and a higher value, which then you treat as having the same value. And I have a queen of clubs in my hand. So I could resolve it right away.\nThe other thing I could do… I have two queens. I have the queen of clubs and I have the queen of hearts. So I could also Exceed, which is \u0026ldquo;discard any number of cards with the same value and remove the same amount of face down Fate cards.\u0026rdquo; And that would just kick two of the Fate cards out.\nBecause I\u0026rsquo;m going to want to play that queen because none of my other cards are the same value or suit. And because I know that I\u0026rsquo;m going to do that, maybe instead the action that I will take is Synchronize, which is, \u0026ldquo;Discard a card from your hand and draw two additional cards from the Destiny deck. You must immediately attempt to resolve a Fate card. Narrate how you resolve Fate with precise timing.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I am going to discard my nine of hearts because that is like– I\u0026rsquo;m trying to keep something of each suit in my hand because that seems to be helpful, and nine is sort of the lowest repeat suit I have. So I am discarding the nine and I\u0026rsquo;m drawing two more cards to add to my hand.\nGot a five of diamonds and a ten of diamonds. So I did at least get new suits, which is good. Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any diamonds in my hands before.\nSTEPH: Alright, so we have an ace, a three, two fives, and a king with a six in hand. Okay. I think let\u0026rsquo;s Synchronize. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to discard the three that I have and draw two additional cards from the Destiny deck, which is just the top. So I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn also a queen and another king, this time of spades instead of hearts.\nSATAH: And then I have to \u0026ldquo;immediately attempt to resolve a Fate card,\u0026rdquo; which, luckily I can play my queen of clubs against Fate\u0026rsquo;s four of clubs, which means that I resolve it.\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;You must immediately attempt to resolve a Fate card. Narrate how you resolve fate with precise timing.\u0026rdquo; I do not have a higher club, so I cannot just resolve this scot-free, unfortunately. And if I play below, so if I play either of my fives, that would… that\u0026rsquo;s a nothing. They would just stay there and I think might add to the line of Fate?\nSo I think for the sake of keeping things clean, I\u0026rsquo;m going to play this Queen of Hearts to resolve this Six of Clubs.\nSATAH: Queen of Clubs. Clubs, Destiny themes: \u0026ldquo;You use your intellect. You channel unlimited energy into reckless resolution. Your tenacity brings new opportunity.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: Hearts: \u0026ldquo;I express my emotions. I elicit vulnerability to build a connection. My innocence is pure and steadfast.\u0026rdquo; Big Candyland energy.\nSATAH: And a queen is, \u0026ldquo;You draw strength from faith in someone.\u0026rdquo; Ooh.\nSTEPH: And with a queen, I \u0026ldquo;draw strength from faith in someone.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s right! The power of friendship coming in hot and early!\nSATAH: So I think the fate in somebody should certainly be my bandmates, right? Or at least one of them. And I think that I can claim this both as using my intellect and a tenacious opportunity that like I am holding on for dear life to this suspended platform and I guess– this room has to be very large, which is fine. It was a back room that was also a warehouse and it\u0026rsquo;s big. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. Um.\nSTEPH: I think this is a moment of great fortune. I think this is like drawing a double yellow and I think just for funsies, I think the starting space on which my friends and I are currently located just suddenly turns very springy, like bouncy. On a marshmallow, perhaps. And we are all launched two yellow spaces over. A significant amount of progress. And land safely.\nI think we hold hands and do that sort of formation skydiving situation and land beautifully in the midst of the peppermint woods. It\u0026rsquo;s cool. There\u0026rsquo;s a sort of… dental hygiene toothpaste energy that really is sort of counteracting everything else that\u0026rsquo;s going on in the space, and frankly, it\u0026rsquo;s refreshing, you know? It– and the peppermint lumberjack is so tall, it feels like there\u0026rsquo;s– there\u0026rsquo;s really an adult in the room who would want us to brush our teeth. Much like we have all wanted our charges to stop playing Candyland, brush their teeth, and go to bed. Please, it\u0026rsquo;s ten PM and you are five.\nSATAH: I think about my band. And I think specifically about a day where we were all talking about, like, ~what we\u0026rsquo;re gonna do in the future!~ And some– like, hyping each other up and someone was like, \u0026ldquo;Look. We\u0026rsquo;re gonna be so famous they\u0026rsquo;re gonna try and sell this building for a billion dollars just because we practiced here. Let\u0026rsquo;s give them something to find.\u0026rdquo; and hid… an instrument of some kind, like, in the ceiling or the walls or something.\nLike a drumstick would be– like, drumsticks would be easy, obviously. Could be like something like a like a ukulele or something. But I think I like the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s drumsticks. Like it was it was the drummer, right, who– we- we practiced here because of her? The drummer, like, hid a pair of her sticks in- in a panel in the ceiling.\nAnd I think about this and I\u0026rsquo;m, like, thinking about how strongly she believes– believed then and believes now– in what we\u0026rsquo;re doing. And I, like, strain and struggle to– I lift myself up on, like– I\u0026rsquo;m crawling up the ropes that suspend this platform and holding on as it\u0026rsquo;s swinging wildly and I get to that thing in the ceiling and probably have– there has to be, like, a moment where I nearly fail and then I, like, see her being like, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t give up!\u0026rdquo; You know. Friendship power stuff? Um.\nAnd I pull those drumsticks out. And because I have the music magic powers, um, that means I now have a weapon.\nSTEPH: There\u0026rsquo;s something about drawing a decent card immediately when you play Candyland that gives an incredible sense of hope. Like maybe this is going to be a really short game.\nAnd it is joyous.\nSATAH: I drop back down to the platform and start drumming a little beat. [Giggling] And it, like, warps the air around– there\u0026rsquo;s, like– special effects start and whatever to show that I\u0026rsquo;ve got powers.\nSTEPH: My friends and I all look at each other– still holding hands, because of course we are– and murmur to each other, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re doing it. This is so much easier than we thought it was going to be. I mean, to be fair, Candyland is an easy game but we thought it would really put up some more resistance. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s like it wants us to win. It\u0026rsquo;s such an easy path.\u0026rdquo;\nWho would trick us here in this beautiful, minty place? The red and the white blending into a soft pink. Nothing could harm us here. Nothing would dare impede our progress or make things more difficult.\nI say as I draw another Fate card into the line. More obstacles in the way.\nSATAH: And I\u0026rsquo;m going to flip the next Fate card.\nSTEPH: And so I\u0026rsquo;ll draw… second card.\nSATAH: Seven of diamonds.\nSTEPH: The ace of spades.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;A fate of stagnation and paralysis. A fate of waste and destruction.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;A fate of instability and discord. A fate of misfortune and chaos. This fate draws out the worst from you.\u0026rdquo;\nI think, in this moment… I think it is time to turn to the classical villain of Candyland, Lord Licorice, the one and only. Because I\u0026rsquo;ve always been kind of under the impression that Lord Licorice… being not a very popular candy, and indeed making you lose turns when you land on his spaces, is also sort of a hater of Candyland. In the way that, like, the Grinch hates Whoville, you know?\nAnd I think as we wander through the peppermint forest, there is a sudden, herbaceous, slightly bitter, and immediately recognizable smell. We all know it to be Lord Licorice, and he extends a hand.\nHe says, [In a French accent] \u0026ldquo;My friends, it is I, Lord Licorice. I see you have come here with one thing in mind: to destroy Candyland as a concept and a board game, to ensure that you are engaging in intellectually stimulating sorts of board games. I, too, tire of this saccharine, irritating, colorful sort of pastime. Join hands with me, and we shall decimate Candyland together. We will dissolve it like sugar in… water?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we all consider this because, well. The enemy of my enemy, as they say.\nSATAH: Okay, \u0026ldquo;chains of fate continually seek to bind you,\u0026rdquo; yeah.\nStagnation, waste, destruction. Yeah, so I think what this is, is that in reaction to me pulling these drumsticks out of the ceiling, the record exec is furious and is like, \u0026ldquo;Fine. Well, if you\u0026rsquo;re going to play that way, then I\u0026rsquo;ll just take the whole place down.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd like… presses play on the iPod in a holster on her belt. And a song starts blaring that creates a big ol\u0026rsquo; monster, magic monster, uh, that is trying to tear the building down completely. Like, just like– fuck it. We\u0026rsquo;ll take it. We\u0026rsquo;ll– I- I was going to preserve this for you as something special but no, now you don\u0026rsquo;t– you don\u0026rsquo;t get to have it. I\u0026rsquo;m going to destroy it. Uh, and also keep you from like– I don\u0026rsquo;t know what other tricks you have up your sleeve so, just gonna destroy it.\nSTEPH: I think for a moment we are all so ready to go with it. Because, my god, finally someone who understands. You know? We– we haven\u0026rsquo;t exactly spoken to anyone else here. We\u0026rsquo;ve mostly been trying to avoid them and frankly, we would have avoided Lord Licorice if we had the chance. But you know, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to know that our feelings about Candyland are reasonable and justified.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;ve got a 10 of diamonds, which is the same suit and higher than the 7 of diamonds. So I am good to go on resolving that. So I could just resolve it. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if there\u0026rsquo;s anything else that I can do.\nI think that I\u0026rsquo;m just going to straightforwardly– I\u0026rsquo;m going to- I\u0026rsquo;m going to resolve this Fate card. I\u0026rsquo;m going to play my 10 of diamonds on the Fate\u0026rsquo;s seven of diamonds, which because it\u0026rsquo;s the same suit and a higher value, is treated as a seven, so it\u0026rsquo;s equal, meaning \u0026ldquo;balance and harmony quell Fate. Remove both Destiny and Fate cards from the line of Fate.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd 10 of diamonds… diamonds: \u0026ldquo;You experience growth, you initiate and pass judgment on a decision. You protect things important to you.\u0026rdquo; And 10 is, \u0026ldquo;success breeds good fortune.\u0026rdquo; Interesting.\nSTEPH: So what I will do here is I will resolve Fate and Destiny, and I will play the ace of diamonds in response to this ace of spades. Uh, so I am at the card\u0026rsquo;s value. \u0026ldquo;Balance and harmony quell Fate.\u0026rdquo; I \u0026ldquo;remove both Destiny and Fate from the line,\u0026rdquo; leaving me with four cards.\nAce is us bringing out the best in ourselves and diamonds are we \u0026ldquo;experience growth,\u0026rdquo; we \u0026ldquo;initiate and pass judgment on a decision,\u0026rdquo; I \u0026ldquo;protect things important to me.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: That ties really easily into, like– protecting something that\u0026rsquo;s important to me, right? Like, this building that I think probably has, like, an illusion on it that is making it into this future thing, right? Yeah, I think I want to settle that, that, like– before, like, at the beginning, I said I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if this was like a projection of the future or if this was real and I think it\u0026rsquo;s a projection.\nI think that right now, this building is actually abandoned. Like, the– all of the stuff did happen, that, like– it got bought by a chain and then turned into another chain, but this final step hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet. They just– that company went bankrupt and this building has been sitting empty, but right now is projected into this, like, bougie future thing. So I still have the chance to let it not happen, basically, is my point. Um.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– I am gonna protect it. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna protect it. And I think that what \u0026ldquo;success breeds good fortune\u0026rdquo; means here is that, like, using my drumsticks… and my music magic, um, I defeat the monster, right? Like that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s sort of the big action sequence is– this monster is trying to just tear this place apart. And I managed to subdue it with my own– like, probably much weaker because drums aren\u0026rsquo;t my- my instrument. But again, I\u0026rsquo;m leaning into the faith of my– my friend who\u0026rsquo;s a drummer. And- and channeling her as much as I can.\nAnd I imagine there\u0026rsquo;s a callback to earlier in the show, you know? Like, we had a fight where I was like, \u0026ldquo;This song that we\u0026rsquo;re writing is full of feelings. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be playing so hard and fast. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit. Why do you have to be the center of attention? Like, just be quiet.\u0026rdquo; And I end up, just in my desperation, falling into playing the thing– like, the harder, faster thing that she\u0026rsquo;d been writing, and it\u0026rsquo;s, like, recognisable. And at a certain point, I, like, mutter out loud to myself, like, \u0026ldquo;Ugh. Okay, you were right. This is better.\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s like– it defeats the monster. [Laughing] Um.\nSTEPH: We are well seduced by Lord Licorice and his too-good-to-be-true promises. Because there are at least… I have looked up a number of board versions of Candyland for this and to be perfectly frank? There are some handsome Lord Licorice iterations in here.\nWhich one is this? Um. Yeah– hey. 2010 Candyland Lord Licorice. He looks kind of like Captain Hook from Peter Pan. It\u0026rsquo;s a vibe.\nUh, and I think many of us do enjoy this. I think it\u0026rsquo;s really, uh– it\u0026rsquo;s enticing. In addition to the fact that we love to be able to see eye to eye with someone, even though they may be a villain. And all of us– friends, compatriots, co-conspirators– agree that yeah! Let\u0026rsquo;s stick with this guy. This is a good idea.\nAnd then I look around. I let the smell of peppermint waft over me. In the distance, I hear the dull thwack of a candy axe against a candy tree. It\u0026rsquo;s ringing and serene. And for a moment– the one moment, the important moment, I remember, this dude is the villain of the game. His entire deal is to impede the progress of those who would pass through Candyland and seek an ending. So surely something has got to be up.\nAnd I say to my friends, \u0026ldquo;Whoa, hey guys. Do we really need– do we need help for this? Are we the sort of people who can\u0026rsquo;t solve our own problems? Who… forever draw on cards, hoping over and over again to draw a red card to escape the molasses swamp?\n\u0026ldquo;No. No. We\u0026rsquo;re the sort of people who say, \u0026lsquo;Look, there\u0026rsquo;s a dog outside,\u0026rsquo; and while the toddler runs over to look for a dog that we just made up, we slide that card in. We do it ourselves. We pull ourselves up by the Candyland bootstraps.\n\u0026ldquo;Also, I think we should be just a little bit genre savvy here, guys. He is the villain. Any sort of interaction with him slows us down. And do we really want to be here any longer than we absolutely have to be?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the gang looks appropriately chagrined. There are some hung heads, some frustrated sighs. One friend who was asking if Candyland had cell phones, and if so, would Lord Licorice perhaps like to exchange numbers so they can talk about this plan thing more? We let that one happen, for the record. Love wins.\nBut eventually, as the person who has taken point and is responsible for drawing the cards, I say, \u0026ldquo;Sir, I appreciate it, and I know that you do noble work, but we don\u0026rsquo;t belong here, and our quest is our own.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd yeah, maybe he tries to stop us, but at that point I stopped listening because I drew another card. And it\u0026rsquo;s time to get marshmallows sproinged somewhere else. Let\u0026rsquo;s flip a Fate card!\nSATAH: I think that success breeds good fortune is that, like, is, um– I defeat the monster so hard that it– her– the- the iPod of the record exec, like, sparks. And she, like, yells and has to rip it off and throw it, and so she certainly still has other stuff up her sleeve, but she now doesn\u0026rsquo;t have access to that specific weapon. And that- that resolves that.\nSo now I\u0026rsquo;ve got these three Fate cards. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to reveal one!\nSTEPH: Uh, the nine of clubs.\nSATAH: The nine of diamonds.\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;A fate of danger and suspense. A fate of arrogance and ignorance.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;A fate of stagnation, waste, and destruction.\u0026rdquo; Cool.\nSTEPH: And \u0026ldquo;the chains of fate continually seek to bind.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: My inkling is that I\u0026rsquo;m going to… lean into, like, the stagnation thing here of, like, the exec being, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, what. You\u0026rsquo;re just going to play the same shitty small shows and venues over and over for the rest of your life? You could be so much bigger. Look at you.\u0026rdquo;\nUm, but first I have to decide what my action is going to be.\nSTEPH: I think, yeah, in choosing to draw another card, to go with the existing path, we are not breaking any molds. We are indeed playing Candyland, the game that… so exhausts us. So the arrogance is absolutely there.\nWe spring, we sproing. Mushroom. Not mushroom. Marshmallow. Wonderful.\nThis one is just a blue. One blue. Lone. We move, like, two steps. Lord Licorice is still there, but, you know, with the sort of recent browbeating, he\u0026rsquo;s clearly about to make his way out.\nAnd so, again, in our arrogance, we don\u0026rsquo;t see any possible danger here.\nSATAH: So what happens when you res– when you play a Destiny that is above a card\u0026rsquo;s value? \u0026ldquo;Draw a new Fate card from the bottom of the deck and place it face down…\u0026rdquo; Okay. So I think I have to do that. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any other options right now. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything that\u0026rsquo;s the same value. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything that adds up to the value or has a difference of the value, I think. What\u0026rsquo;s 13 minus 5? Not 9. [Laughing] Close, but not 9.\nSo I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to Synchronize. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to discard my jack of hearts and pull two Destiny cards.\nAnd I just pulled a diamond! So I can actually resolve that. Because what I was going to do– when you Synchronize, you \u0026ldquo;discard a hand, draw two cards, and then immediately attempt to resolve a Fate card.\u0026rdquo; I was just going to play my queen of hearts on Fate\u0026rsquo;s nine of diamonds, and then what that would do is draw a new Fate card, and so I was like preemptively like, well, I would like more ammunition, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to discard a card and then pull. But I pulled a diamond! So I\u0026rsquo;m just going to resolve it. And– and I have to talk about how I did it with precise timing.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see. Queen of diamonds. Queen is, again, \u0026ldquo;You draw strength from faith in someone,\u0026rdquo; and diamonds, \u0026ldquo;You experience growth. You initiate and pass judgment on a decision. You protect things important to you.\u0026rdquo;\nI mean– I\u0026rsquo;m so glad this is another queen, actually. Like, that is so perfect. That just means that I have to draw strength from another bandmate, right?\nSo, drew strength from the drummer… I think I\u0026rsquo;m a… primarily a guitarist and vocalist. So let\u0026rsquo;s throw a bass player– there\u0026rsquo;s probably a bassist and, uh, someone who plays keys. Let\u0026rsquo;s make this the person who primarily plays keys, who I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw strength from.\nAnd how do I do that? So what\u0026rsquo;s going on?\nYeah, so it\u0026rsquo;s the thing I was saying about, like, the exe, with a little bit of desperation now is like, \u0026ldquo;Why are you fighting so hard for this? This, really, is what you want to preserve? This shithole? You want to linger forever in that part of your life where you were struggling and exhausted, and this band was all you had as an escape from the real world?\n\u0026ldquo;You have real talent. You could be somebody. You could be a real person. But no. For some reason, you\u0026rsquo;re fighting to keep playing the same shitty, tiny clubs over and over for the rest of your life, always being the local opener to the touring act. Why? Why are you fighting so hard for that when you could be so much more if you just joined me?\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: In the arrogance that every next step will be perfect, we fail to see the crumbling of the road ahead.\nAt this point, I think… hmm. What to do what to do what to do. Because I have two fives and two kings, so I have two pairs. I have spades and I have hearts, neither of which are particularly useful for me right now. Um, I could add more, but I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly inclined to at the moment… so I think what I\u0026rsquo;ll do here is I will just Exceed, so remo– \u0026ldquo;discard any number of cards with the same value and remove the same amount of face down Fate cards.\u0026rdquo; So I will take the two fives out and then remove two face down Fate cards.\n\u0026ldquo;Narrate how you resolve Fate when things line up.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think… I think the card gods are merciful. I think the card gods are kind. I think the path is smooth. And more importantly, we have drawn the Queen Frostine card, which, again, is the farthest you can go in a single pull. And it\u0026rsquo;s good. It\u0026rsquo;s merciful. It\u0026rsquo;s like we stacked the deck ourselves. And indeed, we may have– who\u0026rsquo;s to say if we got sucked into the exact game that we were being forced to play, which had been carefully stacked to ensure that the toddler won in spite of, uh, more competitive natures that we may have?\nSATAH: The resolution card says– there\u0026rsquo;s– \u0026ldquo;experience growth, or initiate and pass judgment.\u0026rdquo; I think it\u0026rsquo;s both of those, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s like… so again, I\u0026rsquo;m drawing strength on somebody- from somebody, from the keyboardist.\nAnd I have a moment of conflict, right? Because she\u0026rsquo;s kind of getting to me. I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah. I am tired of doing the same shows, the same competitions over and over again. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the life I dreamed of for myself. I want something more. I want something bigger.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then I think about loading the van after a show and the keyboard player is, like, bouncing. She\u0026rsquo;s always bouncing. And I\u0026rsquo;m loading stuff and I\u0026rsquo;m just looking at her and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Were you playing a different show from us? Because that sucked.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she, like, laughs and nods and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I mean, not a great crowd, not our best set, but you know.\u0026rdquo; And she shrugs like it\u0026rsquo;s obvious.\nAnd I, like, shake my head. I\u0026rsquo;m, like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. What do you– what do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh! Well, I mean… I guess it sounds kind of stupid, but I love every show. I\u0026rsquo;m doing the thing that I love to do, and I love that every show is different. Even though we play here a lot, I always see a new face in the crowd. Or if it\u0026rsquo;s all the same faces, somebody\u0026rsquo;s wearing a new shirt. And they love it, you know? They want to talk about it. They want to talk about the show that they got the shirt at. Or somebody got a new job or somebody got laid off and they need tonight. They\u0026rsquo;re celebrating or they need the distraction.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s never the same twice. And… I love that. It\u0026rsquo;s important to me. And I think… it would be kind of hypocritical of me if… if it\u0026rsquo;s so important that things be different, then I kind of have to accept that sometimes they\u0026rsquo;ll be bad. [Giggles] And unless I want things to be the same all of the time, realistically, I can\u0026rsquo;t always ask for them to be good and turn out well.\n\u0026ldquo;So, then sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s going to be like tonight. But the important thing is, a lot of them won\u0026rsquo;t be. So I guess it\u0026rsquo;s easy for me.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m, like, grumpy because we just played a shitty show and, like, a bunch of stuff went– like, I broke, like, three guitar strings somehow, which makes no sense and just– it was terrible. We made no money. And so at the time I\u0026rsquo;m, like, grumpy and I can\u0026rsquo;t really accept it.\nAnd I think that probably there was a big inciting incident right after that. You know? Like, big fight. And I started to get seduced to the dark side, as it were, with this record exec and experience like the– partially, like, the promises of like, \u0026ldquo;What if every show were good?\u0026rdquo; Right? \u0026ldquo;What if it was so curated– what if we controlled so many aspects of the show that it was always good? What if you were so popular that everyone in your audience was always there to see you and loved you?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s appealing to me, right? Especially when I\u0026rsquo;m struggling with that.\nSTEPH: The end is now so clearly in sight. Candy Castle. It\u0026rsquo;s waiting for us.\nAnd then we realise on second or perhaps third thought, we don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what we were supposed to do when we got there! Um, destruction is not a plan. Erasure is not a plan. There were no steps. There was a lot of, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out when we get there.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: But in this moment, it all hits me and I\u0026rsquo;m, like, laughing again, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, yeah. She was right, too.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the exec\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m just like, \u0026ldquo;I mean that… look. First of all, I think you\u0026rsquo;re wrong. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that this is my life forever, or our lives forever. I think we really can do something with this.\n\u0026ldquo;But you know what? Even if we don\u0026rsquo;t, even if we\u0026rsquo;ve already hit the apex? We\u0026rsquo;re at the top of our game and it\u0026rsquo;s never going to get better than this? I mean, fuck. I could do a lot worse, couldn\u0026rsquo;t I? And I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth fighting for. I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth preserving.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd… as some new monster appears… she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have her iPod anymore. So what does she do? I\u0026rsquo;m just going to go on a tour of, like, uh, obsolete music technology. She\u0026rsquo;s, like– slams a CD– oh my god. She has, like, a CD holder on her body somehow? And she can, like, flip it open and pull out a disc and she like tosses it into a cd player and hits play. Or maybe she even throws another cd at it to hit play for her, which is, like, scandalous to me because I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;That has music on it!! And you\u0026rsquo;re just throwing it around?! You have no respect for the arts!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, uh, I think just as a little bit of colour at this point, I\u0026rsquo;m needling her like, \u0026ldquo;Come on, you don\u0026rsquo;t even play?\u0026rdquo; And there\u0026rsquo;s, like, something about who she used to be, right? Like I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s in your brochure. You talk about how like you were this big deal guitarist and then you got into production and now you own this company and you won\u0026rsquo;t even play to fight me? You\u0026rsquo;re just going to play recordings? Come on.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she, like, sneers and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so beyond that.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs]\nAnd I gotta flip a Fate card. And then I have to read the rules again because I keep– I- I think that this is part of what I got wrong last time, so…\nSTEPH: I am also realising that I now have one face down Fate card left, which satisfies one of the conditions to initiate the Final Destiny phase.\nGAME: FINAL DESTINY SATAH: \u0026ldquo;When you have one face down Fate card left on the line of Fate, or you have zero cards in your hand, you enter into the final phase of the game.\u0026rdquo; Yes! So I have revealed a Fate card. It\u0026rsquo;s the seven of hearts.\nSTEPH: So we have our face down card and our nine of clubs.\nSATAH: Um, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go into Final Destiny!\nSTEPH: Alright, so–\nSTEPH \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Keep any unresolved Fate cards\nSTEPH: on the line of Fate.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Got that. One face up card, one face down card.\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;If there are more than one face down Fate card,\u0026rdquo; nope.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Discard any remaining cards in your hand.\u0026rdquo; Bye, friends. Discarding my four cards.\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;Discard any remaining cards in your hand.\u0026rdquo; So, pair of kings, it\u0026rsquo;s been a wonderful time, but farewell.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Reveal the last face-down Fate card. Use the suit and value along with any unresolved Fate cards to narrate your predicament.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;Reveal the last face-down fate card.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Each unresolved fate intensifies the adversity and hardship in the situation.\u0026rdquo;\n[Card fwip] So. That is the Jack of Diamonds. \u0026ldquo;A fate of loneliness and isolation. A fate of betrayal and apathy stalks you.\u0026rdquo; Oh no!\nSTEPH: It is a six of spades. \u0026ldquo;A fate of instability and discord. A fate of misfortune and chaos consumes you.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Diamonds, for the final card, is \u0026ldquo;stagnation, waste, destruction.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: So, a six. \u0026ldquo;The chains of fate continue to bind.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: And a jack is a big deal. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at that. \u0026ldquo;Trickery and misdirection deter your path.\u0026rdquo; Ooh!\nSTEPH: We arrive at Candy Castle. It\u0026rsquo;s there. The promised ending. The ending of all plays of Candyland forever. Milton Bradley is never going to know what hit them.\nI think Milton Bradley owns Candyland. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure and I\u0026rsquo;m not inclined to check.\nAnd then, as the fearless leader, I am obligated to ask, \u0026ldquo;Hey, so how– was there a plan? For the destruction of Candyland? Or did we just think if we won, it was gonna… we weren\u0026rsquo;t competing against anybody. We know that, right? So what do we do?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd at this point, the group dissolves into yelling.\nSATAH: So. The final setup here has to pull in the last band member. Which I guess is the bass player, we\u0026rsquo;ll say.\nAnd this has to be the person who I\u0026rsquo;ve had the most contentious relationship with. I think that we jokingly refer to each other as exes because we dated in kindergarten, you know? In that– we got married in kindergarten and then divorced that day. And we\u0026rsquo;ve always jokingly referred to each other as exes and as divorcees, uh– as having– as divorced from each other.\nAnd I think that… we have really leaned into that joke a lot as we have alternately and always with incredibly poor timing had feelings for each other. Always when it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible to do anything about it, or… just– it never felt like it could actually work. And so we just kind of lean into that like, \u0026ldquo;Haha! We\u0026rsquo;re divorced.\u0026rdquo; type thing… when we have actually been in love! We\u0026rsquo;ve been mutually pining for each other for ages. Um.\nAnd so I think what happens here is she walks out from behind the record exec. And she\u0026rsquo;s, like, super dressed up. And I stop and I\u0026rsquo;m like– I need a name for her. I\u0026rsquo;m just– Macy was what came to mind– just gonna be like, \u0026ldquo;Macy?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, hey. Sorry. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise I was interrupting anything. I just wanted to return this contract.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd hands a piece of paper over to the exec who sneers and is like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, perfect! Well– it looks like I don\u0026rsquo;t need you, then,\u0026rdquo; and turns to me.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m just, like, stunned. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Wh– what– what do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\nMacy, like, walks forward to the edge of wherever they\u0026rsquo;ve been standing up at the top looking down and leans over. And she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;What? You really think you\u0026rsquo;re the only one of us who has ambitions? You have no idea. And I\u0026rsquo;m exhausted by it.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so tired of you and the band. Of all of this drama. And all of these feelings. All of the fighting. I\u0026rsquo;m just exhausted. I just want to make music. And I don\u0026rsquo;t really care anymore if I do it the right way.\n\u0026ldquo;So, when an offer I couldn\u0026rsquo;t refuse came along, I didn\u0026rsquo;t refuse it. But, uh… tell the other girls good luck from me, okay?\u0026rdquo; Like, winning smile.\nSTEPH: It is chaos. Because everybody had sort of a vague plan. You know, there are mentions of fire, and then, no, water. It\u0026rsquo;s candy, it\u0026rsquo;s sugar, obviously. There are mentions of, maybe we have King Candy hand over the crown, and we declare Candyland to be no more, and dissolve it as some sort of weird alternate state, maybe. You know, maybe we have to play by the universe\u0026rsquo;s rules. That one person is still saying, \u0026ldquo;What if we called Lord Licorice?\u0026rdquo; Which… not ideal, but hey, you do you.\nAt any rate, no one is able to agree. And I look down and I realise that the cards which have taken us all this way are still in my hand. I can still make a move.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve reached the end. Drawing a card shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do anything. And yet… the deck is still here. And with the deck must be the power to move forward. To overcome. To find something new.\nAnd so while they argue, I step up to the gates. Candy Castle.\nSATAH: And I am going to shout at fate, \u0026ldquo;This is my final turn! I claim my destiny with this card. Draw.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: I draw one final card. And like Martin Luther nailing the 95 theses to the door of a Catholic church, I slam that thang on the drawbridge and I say, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s over! We\u0026rsquo;ve won.\u0026rdquo; And I play my final card in a thundering echo that hits… what is it? Toffee? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Hits the toffee drawbridge.\nSATAH: I got a four of hearts.\nSTEPH: I\u0026rsquo;m currently looking at the king of diamonds.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Draw your final card. Reveal it in the most dramatic flourish possible. You automatically resolve the final Fate card with dramatic reversal.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: \u0026ldquo;Automatically resolve the final Fate card with dramatic reversal.\u0026rdquo; So, this resolves the six of spades.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Use the card\u0026rsquo;s suit or value to guide how to narrate your extraordinary comeback and your triumph in that dire scenario poised by Fate.\u0026rdquo;\nSTEPH: So diamonds, \u0026ldquo;you experience growth. You initiate and pass judgment on a decision. You protect things important to you.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: So a four of hearts. I wish it had been another queen. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that have been perfect?\nSTEPH: And \u0026ldquo;an otherworldly force or inspiration aids you.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: So hearts are, \u0026ldquo;You express your emotions. You elicit vulnerability to build a connection. Your innocence is pure and steadfast,\u0026rdquo; which is– of course. That\u0026rsquo;s easy.\nUm, it\u0026rsquo;s like… and I think the thing that\u0026rsquo;s really funny here is that it\u0026rsquo;s so fast. She\u0026rsquo;s, like, sneering down at me and I take, like, a trembling step forward. And I look up at her. And I just go, \u0026ldquo;You… you don\u0026rsquo;t mean that.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she gets that– has this, like, cruel look on her face. And then smiles bigger and goes, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right. No, I don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; And, like, inexplicably, like– like, throws off the big jacket that she was wearing and reveals that her bass was strapped to her back the whole time. And, like, swings it in front of her and turns to face the exec and yells, like, \u0026ldquo;One, two, three, go!\u0026rdquo; and starts playing and then the other two bandmates, like, burst into the room and they, like– one of them, you know, tosses me my guitar and grabs– yeah. Grabs the drumsticks from me and shoves the guitar into my hands, and we all start playing together… [Giggling] to defeat the record exec.\nSTEPH: And I think in that moment, hand sticky from toffee, the playing card adhering to the door… I look up at what ought to be an isomalt sky with spun sugar clouds, and what I see is a popcorn ceiling. Not like the treat, like the, uh sort of hideous plaster situation that plagues some homes.\nI see faces, large. Gigantic, even. Round and youthful. Toddlers. I hear them laugh. I hear them screech in delight. Double yellow, at Queen Frostine. I hear them wail in despair at the concept of a molasses swamp. I hear their enmity for Lord Licorice and his eternal hindering of progress.\nI hear the thrill of victory as they, like us, arrive at the Candy Castle, but they do not arrive as… conquerors. Would-be conquerors. But as heroes, having braved every trial, every villain– \u0026ldquo;every\u0026rdquo; doing a lot of carrying in the villain sense here.\nAnd I see that as I look around at my friends, teens who are too cool to be here, who are here for the paycheque and would rather play Mario Party,.The thought comes to me, and I shout it:\n\u0026ldquo;Y \u0026lsquo;all, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we\u0026rsquo;re the target audience for this game.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd everyone stops.\nSATAH: And she, like, screams, you know, like, \u0026ldquo;You fool, I already have your contract.\u0026rdquo;\nUm, and Macy is like– it\u0026rsquo;s like some stupid legal thing. She\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I signed it! But not in front of a notary. Did I need a notary?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the exec, like, screams. Like, yes, you know, the contract is null and void because it was not done in front of proper legal representation. [Laughing]\nAnd she tries her best to summon another monster. But the CD player– like, one of- one of the bandmates, the keyboardist, like, pops open the CD player and just plunks in, like, our latest single, um. She\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I like this better!\u0026rdquo;\nUm, and the exec, like, just keeps scrabbling– scrabbling to try and find a way to summon her music monster, but can\u0026rsquo;t because we– she\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s too scared to play the music herself and we just keep taking over all of the music players and that kind of thing.\nAnd… what is– what is the final defeat?\nSTEPH: They look at me like I\u0026rsquo;m an idiot. Which is fair.\nI sigh again. \u0026ldquo;What if we didn\u0026rsquo;t play at all and just sort of moderated the siblings doing it? They\u0026rsquo;re five and three. They know what colours are.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd a moment of realisation. Joy. Freedom. Comes over their faces. They think of other children that they can force into Candyland cage matches to duke it out with each other across that technicolour board, leaving them to be utterly free to mess around on their phones and not really pay attention as long as you can hear them arguing about how many spaces you can get, or, you know, how the rainbow bridge things work.\nAnd one by one, they disappear. Free, their souls light. But not me. I stay there, my hand stuck to the door. And I push. And the drawbridge falls open.\nAnd I walk in. And it\u0026rsquo;s just the start of Candyland again. Though, perhaps this time, seeing a smiling gingerbread tree is a good thing.\nSATAH: I think it\u0026rsquo;s almost– it\u0026rsquo;s– so we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re playing and then I\u0026rsquo;m, like, standing over top of her, and she is, like, ready for the killing blow. You know? And that a single like long note rings out and I\u0026rsquo;m looking down at her and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Seriously, I heard you were pretty good. If you ever want to jam?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she, like, look of disgust overrides her fear. And she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;You should have finished me when you had the chance,\u0026rdquo; and disappears. Um– oh, I like the idea that she, like, reaches up and strums my guitar and that is, like, the power, like– and it teleports her. Like, that is a power that she had. And I, like, gasp and stop the strings, but she\u0026rsquo;s gone.\nAnd I look down and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Whoa. She is good. We gotta be careful we don\u0026rsquo;t end up like that.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s like a big heartwarming, like, \u0026ldquo;We could never end up like that because we have the power of friendship!!\u0026rdquo; [Laughing]\nAnd that is, uh… that is how that ends. We did it. Triumphed over Fate. [Laughing]\nSTEPH: So yeah, I think we have triumphed over Fate in its trials, by which I mean we\u0026rsquo;ve accepted the fate that sometimes you have to play a game that isn\u0026rsquo;t for you. [Laughs]\nAnd yeah! That was My Turn! Draw!\nSATAH: That was so fun. Oh my god. That was so fun, and also, like, what a– what a beautifully just quick experience. That was such a treat. I literally just played it twice in a row and loved it the whole time. I think the– parts of the rules were a little difficult for me to wrap my mind around and jus, like, could genuinely be resolved by, like, layout and a couple of reference tables, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t– it doesn\u0026rsquo;t– it\u0026rsquo;s not a huge deal, because what a what a what a fun fantastic experience that was.

I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah. My goal is to showcase multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together. You can support the show financially at patreon.com/foliopod or join there as a free member to get access to the bonus podcast feed which will at some point include a campaign version of this very game that I recorded before I recorded the playthrough that you\u0026rsquo;re gonna hear in this episode. Start hearing in this episode.\nThis is episode one of our games of The World We Left Behind, a game about exploring an alien planet and discovering what happened to the sapient species that once called it home by Samantha Leigh. The overarching plot of The World We Left Behind is a mystery that you build as you solve it: someone used to live on this planet. Now they\u0026rsquo;re gone. What happened to them?\nThe other two astrotectives– maybe detectonauts?– sleuthing in the stars with me are Dorian and Nick Butler. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a little bit more about them at the break. Let\u0026rsquo;s make our way there by starting with a little bit of character, spaceship, and world creation.\nGAME: SET-UP DORIAN: Alright.\nSATAH: Okay.\nDORIAN: Hello.\nNICK: Hey!\nSATAH: Got a game PDF open on a decade-old tablet I inherited from one of my dead parents.\nDORIAN: I\u0026rsquo;ve got my water; I\u0026rsquo;ve got my tea.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;ve got three to six mason jars of various liquids.\nDORIAN: I\u0026rsquo;ve got my supplies for this game.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;ve got a deck of cards and a D6. What does that add up to? Folio recording time, baby.\nDORIAN: I am ready to play The World We Left Behind.\nNICK: Today we\u0026rsquo;re going to be playing The World We Left Behind.\nSATAH: So The World We Left Behind is a game for one to five players. Uh, obviously going to be focusing on the solo aspect for this particular podcast, but it is also something that you can do with a group of people; a GM-less game.\nDORIAN: I have not played a solo game before, although god knows I love GMless world building games, so this is… squarely up my alley.\nNICK: I am doing this completely blind. I only read the first couple of pages of the game and it said that while you\u0026rsquo;re playing it, you pretty much just read the game as it goes through. And so you\u0026rsquo;re going to be following me as I learn how to play this game and go through a quick solo experience with you guys.\nSATAH: I… have played this. For this show, we are going to be doing the one-shot variant of it, which is provided in the game itself. But I originally, in a fit of hubris, um, was like, no, I can– we can do the full campaign style. And my recording ended up being, like, nearly seven hours long? [Laughs]\nDORIAN: It says to play at your leisure. We are playing a slightly abbreviated version of the solo rules because it turns out this game, if you play it entirely at your leisure, takes a very long time.\nSATAH: Having had that experience, there are parts of this game that definitely I think would shine brighter as a group experience. There are elements of drawing shapes and interpreting that I think are fun to do solo, but would definitely be like a much brighter highlight of the game in a group experience. However, the guidance for the symbols and the interpretation is still a useful and fun and interesting tool in the solo version of it, sort of leading you towards your discoveries and that kind of thing. Not all of this will make sense. We\u0026rsquo;re not into the game yet. You don\u0026rsquo;t have the context, but… I\u0026rsquo;m excited to try the– I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see how it plays in the one-shot version now that I\u0026rsquo;ve done the sort of, like, multi-session campaign style. And I very much would like to try this with a group of people at some point.\nHowever, I do not make a group of people play a game podcast. Technically, I do– technically, I make a group of people play a game. But separately, discretely. Discretely like apart, not discreetly like subtly. Though also maybe?\nDORIAN: So let\u0026rsquo;s get into it.\nNICK: So, uh, let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nSATAH: What am I up to? What am I doing?\nNICK: For materials, we need a standard deck of playing cards. I literally just came back from the store; bought myself a new pack of playing cards.\nDORIAN: I\u0026rsquo;ve got my little deck of cards, a pen to write on them, a six-sided die.\nNICK: Your boy\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of a dice goblin, not gonna lie. Flat surface, I have a desk.\nDORIAN: For me, it\u0026rsquo;s this surface we call a table.\nNICK: Uh, and we got time, baby, so let\u0026rsquo;s do this!\nDORIAN: And a little notebook so that if I am interrupted partway through, I remember what the hell I was doing.\nSETTING UP THE STORY NICK: \u0026ldquo;Setting up the story.\u0026rdquo; This is the section I\u0026rsquo;m on now. \u0026ldquo;Setting up the story.\u0026rdquo; So, \u0026ldquo;Before creating a character, answer the following questions as a group.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: There are a bunch of setup questions. A lot of these aren\u0026rsquo;t strictly as relevant to a solo game.\nNICK: Playing solo notes are going to appear through the book, and the note says \u0026ldquo;Throughout the game, any instructions completed as a group can instead be completed on my own.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: And some of them are things that I would struggle with, I think, anyway, in a group. For instance, the first question is, \u0026ldquo;What tone do you want to set with this story?\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s such a wide open question to me that I really struggle with it. But luckily, because it\u0026rsquo;s me– it\u0026rsquo;s just me, solo game, like, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much in control of that at every moment.\nNICK: So, \u0026ldquo;What tone do you want to set with this story? Examples: eerie, lighthearted, somber…\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: I think I\u0026rsquo;m going for reflective.\nNICK: I want badass!\nDORIAN: A solo journey to me is kind of inherently a like, lonelier or, like, more somber one than if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a group who can kind of bounce off each other.\nSATAH: It probably will be relatively lighthearted, occasionally dipping into melancholia because of who I am as a person…\nDORIAN: And I think that sort of introspective mode is what I want to capture. I think this character– I am envisioning one character. I think there are rules for playing more than one character, even as a solo player, but I\u0026rsquo;m envisioning one person, so it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a lonely journey.\nSATAH: I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to have some cyberpunk-y elements, which means getting a little like edgy and weird corpo stuff at certain points. Especially because this is such an open game that can be so many things, I really want to fall back on my more familiar genre touchstones. I found in my other game of it, I really slid into that without totally meaning to, so I want to kind of set the intention from the beginning.\nNICK: We\u0026rsquo;re gonna do badass. \u0026ldquo;How grounded in science do you want this story?\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Examples: hard sci-fi like The Martian or soft sci-fi like Star Trek.\u0026rdquo;\nNICK: I want it to basically be sci-fi-fantasy.\nSATAH: My sci-fi is soft as fuck.\nNICK: The hardest sci-fi I go into is Star Wars, to be honest.\nSATAH: I love to pretend to scientifically justify things in, like, a very pseudoscientific way?\nI just watched an episode of Fringe where the mystery was solved– it\u0026rsquo;s the second ever episode of Fringe– they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, you know that one Jules Verne story where the eye gets an imprint of the last thing that a person sees before they die? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s not real. EXCEPT that this person was killed after having a, like, muscle paralytic put in them, so actually, their optic nerve is frozen in the exact configuration of the signals of the last thing they saw when they died. So actually it is real, and that\u0026rsquo;s science.\u0026rdquo; which is my favorite shit in the whole world. Don\u0026rsquo;t think about it too hard, too too hard of sci-fi.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;How grounded in science do you want the story?\u0026rdquo; That is going to be a play to find out question. I\u0026rsquo;m not a scientist. I am going to probably incorporate the little bits of scientific knowledge I\u0026rsquo;ve hoarded over the years when they come up and when they seem interesting. But I\u0026rsquo;m not going to interrupt play to research things… probably. And I don\u0026rsquo;t want to ever feel like I can\u0026rsquo;t pursue a cool idea because it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be scientific.\nNICK: I like lasers and laser swords and basically space magic. I want to play space wizards. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of what I am. Space wizard, space samurai.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What do you not want in this story? Examples, eyeball gore, genocide, spider-like creatures.\u0026rdquo; Again, lines and veils type thing, not quite as important when it comes to playing solo, but I will discuss, as always, why I am leaning into the things I am leaning into and why I am leaning away from the things I am leaning away from as I go.\nDORIAN: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. Most of the things that I would normally put on a lines and veils or other safety list are not things I think will come up. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably just shy away from things as they arise if I feel myself heading in a direction that I am not prepared for.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;What are you excited to explore in this story? Examples: strange alien planets, themes of environmentalism, character development.\u0026rdquo; Honestly, I like character development. I like a little bit of mystery, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like puzzles. So I\u0026rsquo;m really going to focus on character development and try to establish a little bit with action.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What are you excited to explore in this story?\u0026rdquo; I will say… again, having now played this game once: at the very end, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that– this game, you\u0026rsquo;re solving a mystery, right? That\u0026rsquo;s sort of the broad strokes of it. You are investigating what happened to the sapient species, the people who people said broadly who lived on this planet and have now disappeared or are gone in some way. And almost every single thing that I found was very directly tied to that.\nAnd then when I came to the ending, some of the questions it was asking seemed to very much imply, like, that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily be the case. That unless a mechanic is specifically tied to the mystery, this game should be much more vibey, explorey. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to say, like, how effectively I\u0026rsquo;ll do that because I do– I get drawn into the narrative. But that is something I want to try to prioritise in this playthrough: exploring the planet and finding clues when I\u0026rsquo;m asked to rather than turning everything into a clue.\nDORIAN: I\u0026rsquo;m excited to explore, uh, playing a solo game. But in terms of actual story themes, I think the… engaging with the alienness and unfamiliarity of the landscape and figuring out, as well, what I want this past sapient civilisation to have been like and how I want to connect it to my own character\u0026rsquo;s circumstances or outlook is something that I think is interesting to me.\nOn that note, I should figure out what my character\u0026rsquo;s circumstances and outlook are because we are at the character creation section.\nCHARACTER CREATION NICK: Character creation!\nSATAH: Character creation.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Answer the following questions individually.\u0026rdquo; Easy. \u0026ldquo;Share your answers with the group.\u0026rdquo; Easy.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;Each player starts by creating one character. These characters will be traveling to the planet together.\u0026rdquo; The playing solo note says, \u0026ldquo;You can choose to play one character traveling alone or multiple characters traveling as a crew. If playing as only one character, skip the group questions.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to be playing as one guy.\nSATAH: I think that one of the reasons my playthrough ended up so long is that I did have a full crew. Not like a huge one, but a three-person crew. And so there was a lot more, especially sort of, like– some of the flying times, like, the leaving the planet, you have to check in with all of the crew members and it just took a lot longer.\nI am not sure if I want to do a s– a loner, like, a– only one person or if I want to have them have a companion that is… fairly uninvolved. I think what I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do is have it be, like, one character. They are part of a group, but that group isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily with them. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re sending messages back to their crew or Dale Cooper style recording messages to Diane throughout it. So I still have, like, some of the potential for that interaction if that\u0026rsquo;s what would be most interesting to me, but the story will be a little bit more focused on just the one person.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Is your character a human or an alien? What do they look like?\u0026rdquo; Less easy. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I have a super clear visual in mind for this person. I think they are probably… at least humanoid or human-like, because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get too bogged down in figuring out like how my character\u0026rsquo;s differences in physiology from my baseline would alter their experience of something, and I want to be able to contrast them with any alien-ness on the part of the civilisation whose traces I am exploring.\nSATAH: Alien and human as a divide is very funny in space exploration games. Even if I am a human, I am an alien on the planet that I am on. But I understand the point of the question and I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go with, uh, like an augmented human? Very much, like, a bunch of cybernetics– maybe even at this point a little bit more cybernetic than flesh? I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure yet. But very much a human, just living in a world where it is not unusual for humans to get a bunch of chrome stuffed into them for various reasons.\nNICK: My character is going to be human because I have no imagination. I\u0026rsquo;m going to say they look like, um… oh, what\u0026rsquo;s his name? Pedro Pascal. Yeah. But not– no, not Pedro Pascal because then I\u0026rsquo;d just be basically playing Boba Fett and that\u0026rsquo;s not cool. Um… bollocks. [Laughs] I\u0026rsquo;m on the spot! I didn\u0026rsquo;t prepare for this at all! Uh, but I am decent at improv so what they\u0026rsquo;re gonna look like is they\u0026rsquo;re gonna be tall, they\u0026rsquo;re gonna be dark and they\u0026rsquo;re not gonna be– not so handsome. They\u0026rsquo;re gonna be a grizzled, like, 50 something year old veteran. Big full beard. Not– more more full than mine, for sure. Definitely gonna have more of a lumberjack kind of vibe. They\u0026rsquo;ve been– they\u0026rsquo;ve been hardened by war and exploration. They\u0026rsquo;re the kind of guy that gets sent out to, um, clean up other people\u0026rsquo;s mess. I imagine the world is very much, like, a cyberpunk dystopia, sort of, but the cyberpunk took the space and made it everybody\u0026rsquo;s problem, if you catch my drift.\nSo, yeah, this guy, he\u0026rsquo;s wearing armor. The armor looks like it\u0026rsquo;s beat up. It\u0026rsquo;s been well used. Well maintained, but it\u0026rsquo;s also been well used. There\u0026rsquo;s going to be a lot of dings, a lot of dents, a lot of scratches, a lot of patchwork. It\u0026rsquo;s been, um, hit with the blowtorch a couple of times and a couple of pieces– it looks like he scrapped up some stuff while he\u0026rsquo;s been on planet a few times.\nUm, it\u0026rsquo;s got some wires and circuits, um, that look like they\u0026rsquo;re pulsing fluid through it. And the fluid goes into the back of his neck. And I will go on about that later. Because I have some ideas now.\nDORIAN: As far as what they look like, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is super relevant because, uh, no one\u0026rsquo;s going to be looking at them. But for the sake of referring to them, I will say that they use they pronouns because that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m gravitating to anyway. That\u0026rsquo;s not a look. If I think of anything about their look in play, I\u0026rsquo;ll mention it.\nSATAH: What do they look like? I\u0026rsquo;m not really a visual person. I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at this unless I sort of like make a picrew and get inspired. But if that ends up being relevant, I will– I will figure it out. But yeah, they\u0026rsquo;re heavily augmented human. That\u0026rsquo;s all I know.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Two words that describe my character.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with curious. I like that as a word because it means both that they are curious about things and they want to explore, but that there also might be something a bit curious about them. Something a little, like, strange or different from their peers.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What are two words that describe your character?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to look up a random adjective generator.\nDORIAN: And I think the other word that describes my character is driven. I think this is someone who, when there\u0026rsquo;s something they want to know… their curiosity isn\u0026rsquo;t an idle curiosity. They want to, like, push forward towards an answer. They want to resolve the questions they have about the world and the universe. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to just like idly let those questions arise and then let go of them.\nSATAH: Brawny was the first suggestion. That\u0026rsquo;s funny. Trite, hurried, attractive, greasy, impartial, soft. Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I may come back to this if I get inspired, but I think it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it\u0026rsquo;s super generative for me, not knowing other stuff yet. So I think I\u0026rsquo;m just going to skip it for now.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;What are two words that describe your character?\u0026rdquo; He\u0026rsquo;s grumpy and dependable.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What is your character\u0026rsquo;s name or title?\u0026rdquo; Yeah.\nDORIAN: I am going to go to the best website on the internet, which is fantasynamegenerators.com– which I think is, like, really just run by one person and is– she is just astoundingly prolific in these things.\nSATAH: Just switching my word type… random noun generator.\nDORIAN: Do I want a Grootslang name? No, I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\nSATAH: So I was playing with the word– with the name Entry Outcome and then the idea that they\u0026rsquo;re called EO. And then it made me think of, like, a serial number and I leapt to the idea that this person is a clone. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s their group– that they\u0026rsquo;re… [Laughs] a group of clones. And they have sort of their like production numbers and names and they\u0026rsquo;ve all adopted different… they\u0026rsquo;ve named themselves in different ways and I think that one of the things is that all of them have a short letter sequence in their production number, their serial number, whatever. And the tradition is that they come up with a name that starts with those letters.\nSo this is somebody who had a serial number that included the letters EO. And then they decided their name was… is it Entry Outcome? Or is it something else?\nDORIAN: Oh my god, there\u0026rsquo;s a Canadian names one. I have to check. I live in Canada, for those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know me. Caleb Brown. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty Canadian name. Maximus Grant. I know a lot of Canadians named Maximus. Undeniably true.\nSATAH: Entry… Operative. Egregious… Outcome. Yeah, their name is Egregious Outcome, and people often call them Eggo.\nDORIAN: Let\u0026rsquo;s just call this character Gwyn. G-W-Y-N. Why? Because I like it.\nSATAH: As if I need some sort of backstory, like, lore reasons to name my characters random nouns. This is, I think, the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve ever actually justified it. Normally I would just be like, yeah, fuck you, their name is Egregious Outcome. But in this, it\u0026rsquo;s because they\u0026rsquo;re naming themselves to fit those things and– some of them, I think, probably go for your more standard names, but I like the idea that they specifically, this group of clones, is like, \u0026ldquo;Why do you get to decide what names can be?\u0026rdquo;\nNICK: His name is Eugene Wallace.\nSATAH: Do they have a title? No, I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\nDORIAN: Gwyn, I don\u0026rsquo;t think has a title yet.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;Why does your character want to travel to the planet?\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Are you a galactic cartographer mapping the planet? Did you pick up an ancient looping distress signal from the planet? Were your ancestors from the planet?\u0026rdquo;\nNICK: I\u0026rsquo;m on this planet because they paid me.\nDORIAN: I envision this– and we\u0026rsquo;re segueing into why your character wants to travel to the planet– I\u0026rsquo;m envisioning this character as from one of those cultures… there\u0026rsquo;s some real world examples of this. It\u0026rsquo;s also a little bit of a fantasy trope, although specific examples are escaping me.\nBut one of those cultures where as part of kind of a coming of age thing, you have to go on some kind of journey. You know, you set out away from your family or cultural group and you are trying to find something or learn something or do something, and coming back sort of shows that you are– you know, it\u0026rsquo;s a mark of adulthood. It might not be like literally moving from adolescence into adulthood; I think this character is a little older than that. But it\u0026rsquo;s a mark of a new phase of adulthood is to like go out and do something and bring something from that experience back to your community.\nOne thing I wanted to be really cognizant of is like– I feel like with these \u0026ldquo;exploring a currently uninhabited place narratives\u0026rdquo; you can really fall into kind of a colonial, like, expansion kind of mindset, you know? Like, oh they\u0026rsquo;re– they\u0026rsquo;re the vanguard who, like, is exploring this place to to see if their people can move there and, like, take it over. And I don\u0026rsquo;t want that. I\u0026rsquo;m indigenous myself, so I\u0026rsquo;m wary of these kind of like manifest destiny– or, uh, terra nullius, that\u0026rsquo;s the one I mean– narratives. So we\u0026rsquo;re staying away from that.\nNICK: They paid me to go find a lost signal for a very important document. Some data for, like, mining minerals or something. And he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know. He just needs to see if the people there are dead and if they are, get back whatever that they found on the planet.\nSATAH: Ancestor with a group of clones is fun, right? Like the original is from here. And I might end up playing with that but I really think…\nI had a lot of fun in my other playthrough doing a sort of like space pirate thing, and I\u0026rsquo;m just very endeared by the idea that… this is a group of clones who maybe were sort of scattered across the universe, doing whatever their intended purpose was as clones, and then found each other and are doing a little bit of a life of crime to support each other as they keep trying to save the other clones.\nAnd I don\u0026rsquo;t want to focus too much on, like… [Laughs] servitude and personhood, so I\u0026rsquo;m leaning more into like an Orphan Black style, where like the clones are just sort of like put out into the world because of mystery science reasons. And there are, like, weird experiments and there\u0026rsquo;s stuff, um… they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re forming a little crew to to bond together and take care of each other and find the rest of the clones, uh, and in the meantime while they\u0026rsquo;re doing that they also have to make a living and they\u0026rsquo;re a little bit on the run… what\u0026rsquo;s the word I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of? Macguffin. Not a- not a- not a– for an emotional macguffin. [Laughing] If that makes any sense.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re on the run. They have to support themselves and they have to do so illegally because they\u0026rsquo;re on the run.\nSo. Why does your character want to travel to this planet? Something to do with foraging, either for food or for things to sell on the gray and black markets. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll say, like, foraging and salvaging. They have all those cybernetics, maybe they need to pick up spare parts so that they can keep each other running. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if all of them are heavily augmented, but at least a few of them are.\nAnd yeah, so they\u0026rsquo;re just they\u0026rsquo;re foraging, they\u0026rsquo;re salvaging, they\u0026rsquo;re trying to find stuff to help them stay independent and keep- keep living.\nDORIAN: I think I\u0026rsquo;m out on this, like, sort of transition into a new phase of adulthood. And the goal for my people is not material gain, and is not, like, a show of strength, but is knowledge. I think that when you do this sort of adulthood ritual or like, practice, this journey is to go out and learn something and bring that knowledge back to your people. I think my society or my culture are people who are lore keepers. We are- we are interstellar– or interplanetary lore keepers to some extent.\nSo I think in this case what I have chosen to do is go to this other planet and I am trying to learn something about the people there. And I\u0026rsquo;m trying to bring it back to my home to share with them.\nNICK: Eugene is not a guy that asks questions. He is a guy that solves problems.\nCREW QUESTIONS DORIAN: Alright, then there\u0026rsquo;s some questions to answer as a group, which I still will answer as a group of one.\nNICK: Skip the group questions because I\u0026rsquo;m by myself.\nSATAH: Even though I don\u0026rsquo;t have a group, I want to slightly narrow this down because I am picturing this person as part of a whole, right? As- as part of a group.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;What role does each character take as part of the crew?\u0026rdquo; I am the only major character we\u0026rsquo;ll see. But I think, like, these journeys aren\u0026rsquo;t entirely solo. I think I\u0026rsquo;m the only one on the planet, but I do think there\u0026rsquo;s a home base, of sorts, that is off the planet– of a crew of people who like are supporting this journey. It\u0026rsquo;s not entirely, like, throwing someone out of the nest. You can bring supports as long as your actual discovery is yours. So these are people who, you know, have already had their own knowledge journeys.\nI think they\u0026rsquo;re on the moon of this planet, and they\u0026rsquo;re sort of monitoring so that if something were to happen to me, they could come in, they could rescue me. In a pinch, they could retrieve my body.\nSATAH: So why is it that they are sent on this mission? They I think… sort of in their old life, they worked on a farm. They were a farm mechanic. So they were mostly– they sort of both, like– they know some basic stuff about food and agriculture, and they know some slightly more advanced stuff about mechanics and- and fixing machines and that sort of thing. And so if you\u0026rsquo;re just sending one person, they are someone who it makes sense to send.\nDORIAN: Overall, I am, you know– I\u0026rsquo;m the leader of this expedition. I am the only person actually expediting. That\u0026rsquo;s not it. Exploring. And so I am kind of doing it all.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Why are your characters traveling together? How do they know each other?\u0026rdquo; They aren\u0026rsquo;t strictly traveling together. They know each other because they are all [Sing-song] clones of the same person. [Laughs]\nAnd more specifically, why aren\u0026rsquo;t they traveling together?\nEfficiency is one thing. Sometimes they just need to send people off to do jobs, like to do stuff at the same time. They got a lot of irons in the fire. Sometimes they send people off to do things to serve as distractions for their investigative work.\nSometimes somebody just needs some space. I think that\u0026rsquo;s a thing for Eggo. They\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so grateful for all of you. I do in fact love you. And also, I grew up mostly being alone on a farm. And it\u0026rsquo;s really overwhelming to suddenly live in a big clone-filled spaceship with all of you, and so please send me on solo missions sometimes. Thank you.\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Why are the characters traveling together?\u0026rdquo; I sort of answered this. The other characters who we may or may not see or hear anything about are not traveling with me. They are traveling to… follow me and to make sure there is accountability and closure should something happen to me, but otherwise they are not interfering. It is sort of part of this process, part of this ritual, is for someone to try and do it on their own and to show that they can do it on their own.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;How do your characters feel about their traveling companions?\u0026rdquo; Eggo cares very much about the other clones. A little reluctantly. It took them some time, but… they\u0026rsquo;re a… they\u0026rsquo;re a weird… family.\nDORIAN: I think I don\u0026rsquo;t think about the people watching over me too much, or I think I am specifically trying not to think about them. Like– I want to treat this as a genuinely independent venture. Like, I have the safety net, but I think that, like, thinking about the safety net too much kind of, like, undermines the experience and, like, the legitimacy of it. Like, if I\u0026rsquo;m not trying my best because I know that someone will bail me out if something really bad happens, then I\u0026rsquo;m not experiencing the journey as I\u0026rsquo;m meant to, is my personal feeling. So as much as possible, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to behave as though I am truly on my own.\nSPACESHIP CREATION NICK: Spaceship creation.\nDORIAN: Spaceship creation.\nSATAH: Spaceship creation.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;Answer the following questions as a group. Who owns the spaceship?\u0026rdquo; I do.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Who owns the spaceship?\u0026rdquo; Oh, interesting.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think that Eggo is a pilot. They definitely can keep the engine running, but there\u0026rsquo;s probably a, like– a general intelligence of some kind doing sort of autopilot, and I think that they\u0026rsquo;re specifically generally sent on like, quite short runs. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re not going halfway across the galaxy or whatever to do their things. It\u0026rsquo;s like, the whole clone ship moves into a sector and Eggo is sent off in, like, a ship that can pretty much propel itself over to a planet or a moon that\u0026rsquo;s like just a couple hours away. Which is, like, pretty safe, all things considered.\nSo for who owns it… I\u0026rsquo;m trying to decide whether it\u0026rsquo;s more interesting to have this be a ship that is, like, sort of communal, or if this was a ship that that somebody joined the crew with. I think it\u0026rsquo;s both. It\u0026rsquo;s like, they rescued one of the– one of the- one of the clones was, like, in this ship and was, like, fleeing from them because it was like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t trust you. You\u0026rsquo;re part of an evil science group that created a bunch of clones.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we were like, \u0026ldquo;No, we\u0026rsquo;re not. We were also created,\u0026rdquo; and they were on the run and their ship broke down and we, like, caught them and we were like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to hurt you. Come hang out with us. We\u0026rsquo;ll fix your ship. And then… you decide what to do with it, okay? If you still want to go by the time we fix it, you can just go.\u0026rdquo; And they ended up not wanting to. And they have now, you know, over the course of our beautiful off-screen found family journey, gotten comfortable with allowing other people to use the ship.\nDORIAN: I think the spaceship is a community vessel. I think my people are pretty communal. And I think especially– like, we probably do have private property to some extent. Personal property. Let\u0026rsquo;s be a little bit Marxist about it and, like, clearly draw the line between personal and private property.\nSo we have personal property, but this spaceship isn\u0026rsquo;t that. These ships are something that is shared by the community and are used for people who are going on these journeys. There are probably other types of spaceship that are used for other purposes, but this is specifically the kind of like–\nI need a name for what this journey is. I want to stay far away from pilgrimage. Walkabout is what it\u0026rsquo;s called in certain Australian First Nations traditions, but I\u0026rsquo;m not Australian, as you can probably tell. And so I want to avoid that.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go a little sci-fi, and let\u0026rsquo;s call it a vectorage. You know, I\u0026rsquo;m striking out on a vector, an unexplored vector, and I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to bring something back. So this is my vectorage, and these are ships that are used for vectorages.\nThey probably are very simple. There\u0026rsquo;s, like, the larger ship, which is a sort of portable floating base. And that has been set up on the moon, as I said, with my supporters. And then there\u0026rsquo;s the small solo craft, which the actual vectorite takes for their personal exploration.\nSATAH: What\u0026rsquo;s that clone\u0026rsquo;s name? I think same batch as Eggo, but they went with a slightly more standard name of, like… Emmeline… Emmeline O- Ol- Olsen. So, same initials, EO. Emmeline… Emmeline Orion. Yeah. This is another clone who I think is friends with the general AI sort of autopilot who hangs out with us now. [Laughs] Maybe. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;What do the interior and exterior of the ship look like? Cramped and homey? Sleek and cold?\u0026rdquo;\nIt looks sleek. And phallic. It\u0026rsquo;s a very long needle nose ship with like, almost, like, pincers at the end of it with two really big turbine style engines on the sides of it.\nSATAH: This is a super functional little moon hopper. It\u0026rsquo;s small. It\u0026rsquo;s purposely painted to be pretty nondescript. It pretty much just fits one person. And I think even needs– like, when we\u0026rsquo;re foraging, I have like a– there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a- a- a container that gets attached to it to hold more cargo. But it\u0026rsquo;s very much just like one person doing short trips.\nMaybe Emmeline was a courier. This is a courier ship that has had the logo and any other identifying information very carefully removed from it.\nNICK: It\u0026rsquo;s big and he\u0026rsquo;s compensating for something. Uh, Eugene is– as good as he is at his job, internally, he\u0026rsquo;s not the most confident guy. He is the kind of dude that when he\u0026rsquo;s not working, he fumbles everything. [Laughs]\nDORIAN: And this particular Vectorage ship is called the, um… Sojourner\u0026rsquo;s Companion. I think that\u0026rsquo;s actually the name of a Magic card, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good one, and it\u0026rsquo;s appropriate to the vibe that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to conjure. So I\u0026rsquo;m taking it.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What is the name of the spaceship?\u0026rdquo; Oh…\nNICK: The name of the spaceship is Gargantuan. It\u0026rsquo;s the SS Gargantuan.\nSATAH: I want like a silly, vaguely science clone word, like… the DNA, the double helix.\nOh, okay. I\u0026rsquo;m on one of my beloved websites, relatedwords.org. Dead Ringer is a great ship name. I think that should be the name of our big ship. Dead Ringer as a clone thing is great.\nHectograph… \u0026ldquo;a duplicator consisting of a gelatin plate from which ink can be taken to make a copy.\u0026rdquo; Yes, absolutely. So this little courier ship is the Hectograph. I think frequently just referred to as Heck. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m taking the Heck.\u0026rdquo;\nPLANET CREATION DORIAN: Planet creation.\nNICK: Planet creation!\nSATAH: Planet creation!\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;How long did you travel to arrive at the planet?\u0026rdquo; I think at least a little while. Because, you know, my culture has been doing this kind of stuff for a long time, so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of stuff that\u0026rsquo;s been explored. But at the same time, it\u0026rsquo;s not like there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of stuff to learn on a planet. So it\u0026rsquo;s not like every single vectorite goes to a completely different planet to try and learn what they\u0026rsquo;re going to learn.\nI think we\u0026rsquo;re probably part of a star system that has, like, a few things that are reasonably close to each other with whatever technology we\u0026rsquo;re using, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to say… it took, uh, it took a few days. I think it took under a week to get to this planet. But I\u0026rsquo;m exploring a part of it that, you know, previous vectorites have not explored to the same extent. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m taking a new sort of section of it. Planets are big.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;How long did you travel to arrive at the planet? From the ship? Not long at all. I\u0026rsquo;m like four hours from the Dead Ringer. How far did we travel to this system? I think that we\u0026rsquo;re on the move a lot. And so it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like travel from where, you know? It\u0026rsquo;s just- we\u0026rsquo;re constantly moving. But I\u0026rsquo;m about four hours from home base.\nNICK: Eugene was in the same star system, but the star systems are pretty fucking big, and his ship is old and the hyperdrive is faulty. So he had to raw dog the trip here and it took him about two weeks.\nSATAH: Writing down \u0026ldquo;four hours travel from the DR\u0026rdquo; made me realise that Dead Ringer acronyms to doctor, which is fun and silly. For like, you know… because… medical… related.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;What does your character first notice about the planet as you approach? Is the world one large ocean dotted with islands? Is the surface completely made of chrome?\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Yeah, what is– what– why am I here, specifically?\nIs this too gross? Is it– I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m… like, a bio waste, uh, dump planet? Because I\u0026rsquo;m looking in part for, like, cybernetic stuff? That definitely probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t– I mean, food isn\u0026rsquo;t relevant, but um…\nIt is gross. And also I like it. And I think that it could lead to a bunch of weird shit to find. So yep, this is a planet that some med tech company turned into just a bio waste dumpster. And then that company got acquired by a company that got acquired by a company that merged with a company that got acquired that went bankrupt. And somewhere along the line, they lost track of this place. Or they were like, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;ll be a whole thing to deal with. Let\u0026rsquo;s try and keep shunting the responsibility to other people,\u0026rdquo; and it just got lost in the shuffle.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s like, technically, it belongs to somebody. We\u0026rsquo;re not likely to get in trouble from it because nobody wants to take responsibility for it. But technically, you know, some enterprising bureaucrat or bounty hunter could get us in trouble. But that\u0026rsquo;s a gamble you have to take sometimes.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;What does each character–\u0026rdquo; me– \u0026ldquo;first notice about the planet as you approach?\u0026rdquo;\nI think this planet is Earth-like, or like the planet that we come from, which I\u0026rsquo;m going to say is Earth-like for my own visualisation.\nI think the colours are different. You know, I think it\u0026rsquo;s got, like, stuff that is recognisably plant matter, but it\u0026rsquo;s differently coloured. I think the plants are sort of like a reddish burgundy kind of colour instead of green. Whatever sort of chlorophyll type thing they have just comes out as a different colour.\nSo when we approach the planet, the whole thing looks kind of like… or at least the section we\u0026rsquo;re approaching, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s in full flower of spring– or… yeah, planets would all have spring. That has to do with the way the sun works.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s in full flower of spring. The plants are all growing, but it\u0026rsquo;s this sort of, like, dark, like burgundy or oxblood colour. And so– and maybe the oceans are different too. I think the oceans are like a really bright sort of like tealy blue. Like it looks almost like you\u0026rsquo;d see with like an algal bloom. But like– so like the colour palette as we approach is really visibly different from an Earth-like world.\nSATAH: As I approach… I think it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of like… at first I think that I\u0026rsquo;m seeing, like, a little city. And then I realise it\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of, like, shipping containers of garbage, just all very neatly in a row, that were delivered here. Probably supposed to be processed at some point, right? But they got abandoned. And the closer you get, it\u0026rsquo;s like, oh, they\u0026rsquo;re in various states. Some of them have exploded or or fallen apart or whatever.\nBut the- the illusion of like buildings is what first catches me, and then realising, oh, no, they\u0026rsquo;re, like, shipping containers.\nAnd they are big. I think they\u0026rsquo;re– these are containers that would have been hauled by a BIG ship, so they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re bigger than sort of– like, you know, something on a transport truck. And even a little bigger than your sort of– [Laughing] the only other shipping– like something that would be on a boat, but the only reference I have for the size of those, really is I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of like scenes in usually, like, procedurals where inevitably the detective ends up trying to find the criminal in, like, a shipping yard and running around… inside… of them.\nSo, you know, yeah, a little bit bigger than that. A whole person could certainly no problem walk inside. And looks like a city, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nNICK: It looks like it\u0026rsquo;s been inhabited. Like, he can see lights coming from the top. Like, it looks strangely, like, populated. Like, it looks like going over the surface of New York City on an airplane, but from space.\nAnd this bothers him a little bit, because if it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be an unexplored planet, what happened here to have that much civilisation?\nSATAH: The other detail I think is, like, interesting there is that, like, one of the reasons they stand out also is that they look untouched. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that no-one has come here or they\u0026rsquo;ve just kind of gone for the easy pickings of the other stuff. But yeah, just a little detail. Neatly arranged, untouched question mark, shipping containers.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;What do you call the planet? Where does this name come from?\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Is it from the native tongue of the people who used to live here? Is it a cataloging number for scientific reference?\u0026rdquo; Oh.\nDORIAN: The planets my people have charted, I think we have sort of like nicknames or like monikers for them for being able to talk about them at all. So I think this planet is the Harvest Jewel because of the strange and striking colour of its foliage.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet if this was a, like… so I know on a meta level, essentially, that, yeah, people have lived here. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they lived here before and then their planet was turned into a dump? I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s the exact type of bummer that I want to explore. Not sure.\nBut I think that it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing that didn\u0026rsquo;t have a name in a database and now just, yeah, has like a corporate name and number and you have to, like, dig. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s basically been redacted because the ownership structure of it is, like, so unclear and strange and hard to follow. And I\u0026rsquo;m not, like, a hacker, so I\u0026rsquo;m sure that one of my crewmates, fellow clones, has the ability to really dig and find out what names it\u0026rsquo;s had.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not super focused on that, so I just call the planet the dump.\nNICK: I really like the kind of naming conventions that are more like, um, like, nods to mythology. So, like… this- this planet\u0026rsquo;s called Eureka.\nSATAH: There\u0026rsquo;s probably almost a Jane Doe type thing that planets get named when that sort of corporate restructuring leaves them a little– their ownership a little ambiguous. It\u0026rsquo;s like… PX-RED-1107. PX for planet, I guess? RED for redacted, as in some– the records of this have been expunged or purposefully obscured and 1107 just being the number of planets that this has happened to. At least that many other planets that has happened to.\nBREAK SATAH: Due to various circumstances and situations, this is the latest before an episode goes out that I am recording the interstitials, the intro and the outro and the break, and I can tell how fuckin\u0026rsquo; boring I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten because it\u0026rsquo;s the biggest thrill I\u0026rsquo;ve had in ages.\nDorian is a dear friend of mine.

So are my band names! This is what I\u0026rsquo;m like! One time– [Dissolving into laughter] one time– this is a true story– one time somebody said to me after a show that they\u0026rsquo;d never seen me live before because they\u0026rsquo;d seen my posters around town but they thought that it was an improv group. [Chair creaking and laughter quieting as they evidently fall backwards in hysterics]\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick rundown of the basics of The World We Left Behind. We\u0026rsquo;re doing the one-shot version, which uses a single 5x5 grid of playing cards, purposefully built to ensure all four aces are included, but otherwise completely random. Your goal is to traverse that grid and discover all four aces, which will give you enough information to figure out what happened here. When you flip a card, you draw a symbol on it as guided by its value, then interpret that symbol alongside the suit\u0026rsquo;s associated trait– creature, plant, landscape, or vestige– to determine what you discovered. Details about your discoveries also get written directly on the card. You start each leg of the journey with six energy, spending one per turn, and camp when it runs out. That\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the broad strokes of it. You know enough to get started… so let\u0026rsquo;s.\n[Laughing] I\u0026rsquo;m a little punchy.\nGAME: JOURNEY SATAH: [Singsong] The one-shot version! What am I going to need to do? I\u0026rsquo;m going to need to take the aces out of the deck.\nNICK: A joker, gone. A joker, gone. An ace, gone. I need three more aces.\nSATAH: One of the other benefits of the one shot version is that because you\u0026rsquo;re not shuffling cards back into the deck you can use white– uh, dry erase. Dry erase markers. I said white because I was thinking whiteboard. Whiteboard markers.\nIf I were to play this game as a group, I love the idea of getting a fresh deck of cards and permanently altering it and then having that as a token for all of us or returning to it multiple times to do an extended campaign or several chained sessions and that kind of thing, chained campaigns. But for just a solo game, I don\u0026rsquo;t love the idea of doing that. But luckily, the one-shot version, do not have to! I\u0026rsquo;m going to use dry erase markers, which I have so many of because whiteboards run my life. I am no joke surrounded by three to five of them at all times.\nDORIAN: So you create the map. For this version of the solo, we are using enough cards for a five by five grid. That\u0026rsquo;s twenty-five. You start with twenty-one, you shuffle in the four aces so that you know that those four cards are here for sure.\nSATAH: How the fuck did I end up with four extra cards? God damn it. I got to do it again. That\u0026rsquo;s so funny. Actually, you know what? I looked at my four extra cards. None of them are aces. So all the aces are in there, which is really the most important thing.\nNICK: [Humming] Building a map… is this that world building that you kids talk about?\nKind of more like a dad joke than anything, but you know. I\u0026rsquo;m in my uncle years, baby. I can make those jokes.\nSATAH: [Far away] If I sound far away from the mic it\u0026rsquo;s because I had to do physical logistics. I had to stand up for it. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it sitting down. It was too much.\nDORIAN: Even with a fairly standard size or a little smaller deck of cards, it turns out that they actually take up quite a bit of space when you fully deal them out. You don\u0026rsquo;t realise.\nNICK: You know what? I don\u0026rsquo;t have space to do this right, so I\u0026rsquo;m just going to do it six by four and leave a card out.\nDORIAN: These are the sorts of things that tabletop gaming will teach you.\nSATAH: So.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;Navigating an alien planet is difficult and imprecise. Even a well-trained pilot might land in a different area than expected.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: And I am not well-trained.\nDORIAN: I determine which character is piloting the ship. Me.\nNICK: \u0026ldquo;Decide which character is piloting the ship.\u0026rdquo; Oh, hey! It\u0026rsquo;s going to be Eugene. Who figured? We did, right? Right, chat? Cool. Alright.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Decide which character is piloting the ship.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s me. \u0026ldquo;This player rolls a d6 onto the map to determine where the ship lands. If the die rolls off the map, roll it again until it lands on a card.\u0026rdquo; Luckily, this takes up my whole surface, so it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much gotta land on a card. [Die clattering]\nDORIAN: I like this. It\u0026rsquo;s very tactile. I like when components of a game like this are multifunctional. Like, the die is a tracker, which we\u0026rsquo;ll see a little later– like, in terms of time. But it\u0026rsquo;s also a physical tracker, which I think is cool.\n[Die thunking] That was a terrible roll. Like physically. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do something that actually has a bit more movement. [Die rolling] There we go.\nNICK: So we\u0026rsquo;re going to take our lucky d6. We\u0026rsquo;re going to roll it. And it rolled on the second row, fourth card.\nDORIAN: Ooh, it\u0026rsquo;s a six. That feels auspicious. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything.\nSATAH: The roll does not matter, but it was a three, just so everyone knows.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Turn the die to six.\u0026rdquo; Already there.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;This die represents your character\u0026rsquo;s energy and their location on the map. The die is reduced by one at the end of each turn.\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Decide which character is the first to step out of the ship.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s me.\nSATAH: All me.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;This player takes the first turn.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;During your turn, your character will move to a new card and learn more about a trait of the planet. You can either move to an adjacent card, either new or uncovered, but you can\u0026rsquo;t move diagonally, or you can stay on the current card. You might prefer to stay put if you just landed your ship and want to uncover the card beneath it, or if you want to further examine an interesting trait your group saw last turn.\u0026rdquo; So that is exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do. I\u0026rsquo;m going to investigate the tile we landed on.\nDORIAN: Alright. So for my first turn, I am going to stay where I am because landing the ship doesn\u0026rsquo;t uncover the spot by default. I\u0026rsquo;ve landed my little craft. I\u0026rsquo;m, you know, away from these people who\u0026rsquo;ve been overseeing me for the past week or so of this journey. And I want to… you know, I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a beat. I\u0026rsquo;m going to probably sleep. And then first thing the following morning, I\u0026rsquo;m going to explore where I landed before I go anywhere else.\nNICK: Eugene has just landed the Gargantuan onto Eureka. Strangely enough, he\u0026rsquo;s found a launch pad that is, um– it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of landing pad that has a tracking system that will pull the ship and guide it safely onto the pad. He clearly was not expecting this at all. Eugene just kind of feels like…\nNICK, AS EUGENE: Well, I mean, the lights are one thing, but this is advanced technology. We don\u0026rsquo;t even have this on my own planet. Hmm. I wonder if I should be expecting company.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to open my scout\u0026rsquo;s log. Scout\u0026rsquo;s log, day one, landing on Eureka.\nThe lights– the lights were the first sign that this planet is actually inhabited. Base told me that I would be uncovering undiscovered planets. And undiscovered usually means unsettled. This feels very, very settled. And I find that… unsettling.\nYes, yes, base. The pun was intended. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m turning off the communication system for now. My contract doesn\u0026rsquo;t say that you need to be listening in to my logs until after the job is done. Thank you.\nAlright. Landing pad: weird. Not used to this.\nSo, routine checks. Scout log on. Base comms off. Hercules system active. There\u0026rsquo;s no clogs in the tubes. Adrenal system level\u0026rsquo;s normal. Cerebral gears are running. Cardiovascular modulation engine functional. Not at top prime, but it\u0026rsquo;s good. Pulse knuckles good. Last time I was on Ares V, I had to resort to the illegal modification I put into these. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re forced into things that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be.\nMy Hercules systems are functioning. The nanocomposite ironer works. [Heavy sigh] Let\u0026rsquo;s get off the ship.\nNICK: So, we\u0026rsquo;re unturning card.\nSATAH: Got the nine of hearts.\nDORIAN: The ten of clubs.\nNICK: This card is the three of hearts.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Encounters: when you spend your turn on a card, you encounter the card\u0026rsquo;s trait and write what you learn in one of its margins. Each of the four margins near the edges of the card represents a different encounter with the trait.\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: So the way this game works is you draw a symbol based on the symbol prompt and then you kind of add some details and then you interpret it. If it weren\u0026rsquo;t just me, the player next to me would add the little things and then I would interpret it, but I\u0026rsquo;ve got to do… [Voice drops into exaggerated morosity] I\u0026rsquo;ve got to do everything myself around here.\nSATAH: I like the guidance that these offer, even if there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit less, obviously, like collaborative interpretation. I think that it\u0026rsquo;s still good guidance.\nNICK: Three means I have to draw a triangle. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to put a little circle on the upper left of the triangle. I\u0026rsquo;m not a particularly artsy guy.\nSATAH: Symbol prompt for a nine is a half circle. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a half circle. Sort of looking like a sun peeking up over the horizon. You can draw anything that sort of incorporates the prompt, like you can add little decorations and whatever, but I am not super gifted visually, so keeping it pretty simple. I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a little half circle. I\u0026rsquo;m going to add a couple little lines so that it could be… the sun peeking over a horizon. Could be a hat. Could be a tongue being stuck out of a very neutral mouth upside down.\nDORIAN: So I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw my arrow and add a couple little details.\nSATAH: Hearts are a creature. \u0026ldquo;Examples: a many-legged turtle, a broken statue of a bird, a fish-shaped lake.\u0026rdquo; One of the things I really like about the traits in this game is that they, um, very explicitly tie in, like, being very broad with your interpretation of a category? Like, a creature doesn\u0026rsquo;t literally have to be like, you see a living creature. It can also be a representation of that creature. And it really– it sort of opens up the field, I think, for a lot of creative interpretations and also lets you tell a lot of different types of stories. Like, you could totally do a planet that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any life on it at all but you keep seeing paintings of birds, right? I think it\u0026rsquo;s really well done and it\u0026rsquo;s done really simply with just, like, the examples that they give, which is incredibly efficient and I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan.\nSo. Looking at my little hat, sun, tongue symbol. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about a creature. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna have to walk carefully here with my weird biomedical waste planet. Because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to– animal gore is not a thing that I want to really linger on. I want to try and not be super gory generally, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see. I will put content warnings in the description as always, depending on sort of where my whims take me there.\nOne thing I\u0026rsquo;m thinking is that this symbol kind of looks like it could just be… it looks like a car– it could be like a cartoon mouse hole. And so I wonder what this– if what this is, is like, I don\u0026rsquo;t even see a creature. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if there are animals here at all, but I see– I\u0026rsquo;ve landed, like, amongst some of these shipping containers and some of the ones that look pristine, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to notice have, something has burrowed into them. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like necessarily a human or a humanoid presence has, like, opened these. It looks like something is just kind of gnawing its way in. And there\u0026rsquo;s, like– quite a few of these different containers have the same little hole in them. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know- I don\u0026rsquo;t know who or what is making them, but there are a bunch of them.\nAnd I think they do look old, you know? It– which doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they aren\u0026rsquo;t here, but these clearly aren\u0026rsquo;t fresh. They\u0026rsquo;ve been eroded a little bit. And that could just mean that they\u0026rsquo;ve moved on to another planet, or it could mean that they\u0026rsquo;re still here, but they just made these burrows a little while ago. We will see.\nNICK: It\u0026rsquo;s hearts… alright, so this is a creature. It\u0026rsquo;s a triangle with a circle on either left. So I\u0026rsquo;m thinking it is… it\u0026rsquo;s a kind of hybrid avian, hybrid reptile kind of creature. Almost like a pterodactyl, but more vulture-like than fully reptilian. And it is hunting for carrion.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s death here along the landing pad. Eugene gets off of the ship and immediately can smell, right through his environmental protection systems that the Heracles system offers him.\nNICK, AS EUGEN: Looks like I\u0026rsquo;ve already made a discovery. I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly pleased with the results.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something above me. It reminds me of the Vultures back on Earth-5. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this is a genetically modified creature or if it\u0026rsquo;s native to Eureka, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to proceed with caution.\nNICK: Alright. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to name this creature Pyramid Pecker.\nDORIAN: Clubs is a landscape. So it\u0026rsquo;s a rock formation and it\u0026rsquo;s like… through some combination of erosion and whatever other forces, like– it\u0026rsquo;s tall and it\u0026rsquo;s narrow and the top is pointy. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s actually a, like, group of these. I had to land very carefully. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise quite how carefully, because it was dark when I came in, but when I wake up and can see everything in the light, I can see there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more of these than I realised. And any one of them looks like it could have kind of punctured my ship had I not been– had I not been careful.\nSo I am in this forest of needle-like rock spires. And it\u0026rsquo;s not clear, you know, what sort of weather phenomenon or erosion phenomenon led to these, but they\u0026rsquo;re very striking. And I think I like them. They\u0026rsquo;re very immediately different from what we have on my home planet, and I think it drives home how big a change this journey is.\nSATAH: In the top margin of the card, I wrote \u0026ldquo;burrows in containers.\u0026rdquo; And with that, I will turn my energy die down to five and decide where to go next.\nNICK: Eugene has noticed that immediately upon landing, there\u0026rsquo;s life here. And there\u0026rsquo;s also plenty of death, and there\u0026rsquo;s… the ecosystem is doing what the ecosystem does. These corpses have been dead for quite some time. They, uh– they\u0026rsquo;ve decayed a bit.\nWith nothing more to uncover here, Eugene decides to head west.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and epistolary TTRPGs.

With me again are Nick Butler and Dorian. Check out TidebreakerRPG.com for a big sale on Nick\u0026rsquo;s cinematic TTRPG Tidebreaker and support your local library for Dorian.\nLast episode, we set up our stories and heard our characters\u0026rsquo; first discoveries. As you heard, number cards direct you to draw a specific symbol on the card to be interpreted as part of your discovery. When you find a face card, you can draw anything, but you also have to describe the outcome of the card\u0026rsquo;s unique scene prompt. We are going to see that play out immediately. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore.\nGAME NICK: So, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go through the taking the turn steps again. Move to the adjacent card.\nDORIAN: After sort of seeing the forest of needle spires, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t take too long; they\u0026rsquo;re pretty similar to each other, I\u0026rsquo;m going to move to the next card.\nSATAH: I landed kind of right in the middle, not right in the middle. I landed at column two, row four. So I think I\u0026rsquo;m just going to make my way around the edge of the map by going over to column one.\nNICK: [Singing] Pick up the card under the die!\nDORIAN: And this is… a card I am struggling to turn over.\nSATAH: I got the four of spades.\nDORIAN: Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s a face card. I will have to look up what that means. I know there\u0026rsquo;s a trait scene.\nNICK: It is the king of spades.\nDORIAN: So this is the jack of diamonds. Diamonds is a plant. This is great.\nSo I find the corresponding prompt on the trait scene table, describe an event that occurs with the trait, and then… do I draw a symbol for this? \u0026ldquo;The player can draw any symbol, not limited to the symbol prompts, add new details to the art, or colour in part of the card.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to do this before I read my trait prompt, because I think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting if I then have to work with what I\u0026rsquo;ve done.\nNow this is a standard deck of playing cards, so there\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of room in the art to add new things. So I\u0026rsquo;m just going to do some kind of abstract little lines that are sort of around the jack\u0026rsquo;s head and next to the big diamond symbols. They\u0026rsquo;re a little wavy. I like a wavy line.\n\u0026ldquo;The Jack of Diamonds: the plant is useful to you.\u0026rdquo; Alright, so I think I\u0026rsquo;ve been walking for a little while. So I\u0026rsquo;ve moved from the needle spires into this little forest of these… it\u0026rsquo;s not a forest. It\u0026rsquo;s a grassland. So there\u0026rsquo;s these like sort of sinuous, like grassy plants that, um… you know, they\u0026rsquo;re rustling in the breeze, and the overall appearance is kind of like an ocean when there\u0026rsquo;s like wind blowing on top of it. Like there\u0026rsquo;s sort of waves in the grass.\nAnd the plants are pretty soft. Um, like they brush against my skin very lightly. And I think I\u0026rsquo;m scraped up from exploring the needle spires. Like, I tried to climb one of them– maybe I fell and there\u0026rsquo;s kind of a nasty– like just a scrape. Not enough to me for me to call for medical attention, but it hurts. And what I do is I take some of this like soft, flexible, like waving grass, and I weave some of it into kind of like a… a mat type form and I use that as a bandage so I\u0026rsquo;m able to like weave some of the plants and wrap them around my arm just to like stop the scrape from getting further aggravated. And they feel like pretty soothing. Like I think these plants– this plant bandage like actively kind of like soothes the injury I have.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to call this, uh, gauze grass. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to name it but that I think is the easiest way for me to sort of summarize what I\u0026rsquo;ve found here.\nMy character has a little like journal, because, you know, you have to track what you\u0026rsquo;rere doing sometimes. And I think despite the spaceships, my people are pretty low tech. So it is a paper journal or it is like a physical thing that I write in. They\u0026rsquo;re not just, you know, like narrating to themselves as I am doing right now.\nSo they make a note of the gauze grass. I think they check– they sketch it a bit and they sort of describe how they\u0026rsquo;ve used it to treat their wound. And then they carry on.\nNICK: So what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do is we\u0026rsquo;re just going to draw a new symbol that is not related to the symbol prompts. I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a little fist. It is a spades card, which means it\u0026rsquo;s a vestige.\nI think because I just headed west from a landing pad, this is actually going to be a research lab.\n\u0026ldquo;Trait scenes: if the encounter card is a face card, find a corresponding prompt on the trait scene…\u0026rdquo; Okay, so the king of spades says, \u0026ldquo;the vestige contradicts an assumption,\u0026rdquo; which means, hmm. Eugene was assuming that… there had to be some sort of data here that could be uncovered. Well, it contradicts the assumption, which means there\u0026rsquo;s nothing here.\nHe walks in, the Herakles system ready.\nNICK AS EUGENE: Hmm. Well, it looks like there\u0026rsquo;s attempts at terraforming. There\u0026rsquo;s hydroponic systems in place. I cannot visually confirm any other signs of life, scavenger or humanoid.\nAnd in fact, it is unusually clean compared to the scene I just left. There\u0026rsquo;s footsteps leading away back towards where I came from.\nI wonder… if it\u0026rsquo;s safe to venture in. However, this is what they\u0026rsquo;ve paid me for, so I think… I think I\u0026rsquo;ll have to press forth.\nNICK: Going inside, it seems that there\u0026rsquo;s computers, there\u0026rsquo;s lab equipment, what looks like a dais with almost like a capsule system with a little roof above the thing. And there is a glass door that pops open as soon as Eugene approaches it.\nHe steps into the tube because his curiosity gets the best of him. And then the glass door closes right in front of him. Little robotic arms pop out of the back casing and interface with the ports on the back of the Herakles system, removing the adrenal tubes and placing in syringes inside.\nThere is a flood of images that enters Eugene\u0026rsquo;s brain. He sees science workers. He sees– he sees maintenance crews. There\u0026rsquo;s people loading docks. There\u0026rsquo;s other folks with clipboards and monitoring all of the signs in this laboratory. It feels like a science vessel for sure, but it also feels military.\nAnd when the visions stop, the machine replaces the Hercules system\u0026rsquo;s adrenal tubes back into your ports. And Eugene wakes up.\nNICK AS EUGENE: [Gasping awake] I really need to stop stepping into alien technology. These people were not human. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I just saw. This place…\nNICK: He starts to think a little bit more. Past what I just described. He saw other images flashing in between. He saw what seemed like almost like a spore cloud eating away at the metal a little bit. Eating away at the dirt. And then the people. The people were being cleaned away. Almost like, um… almost like looking at, like, acid eating away at meat. They\u0026rsquo;re just gone.\nAs his eyes adjust, he realised that this place, it\u0026rsquo;s much emptier than he originally noticed. There\u0026rsquo;s no signs of life here. It feels like there was never signs of life here, despite all of the signs that there was intelligent beings that were here. What were they doing? What happened here?\nSATAH: The symbol prompt for four is a square. I have drawn a cube. It\u0026rsquo;s a square with extra parts to make it 3D. Spade is a vestige. \u0026ldquo;Scrap of parchment, a tree with carvings, a village built into a mountain.\u0026rdquo; Interesting. This is such a like artificial environment that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to parse out what that would be.\nSo there are a bunch of cubular-ish shipping containers around, right? I\u0026rsquo;m picturing them as big rectangles though. I think what this is, is like– so I go up– I\u0026rsquo;m going up to one of the shipping containers that has– that, like an animal is clearly burrowed into. And I pull out my space crowbar and crack the door off, essentially, and go in.\nAnd inside are just a bunch of unmarked boxes. Which is strange, because they should probably be marked with, like, you know, biomedical like alerts or warnings or honestly corporation names. Like they should be branded. But this is like a bunch of just still-closed generic cubes.\nAnd I think if I wanted to hang out here a little longer, I would like try and figure out like if the animals that burrowed in here had like interacted with them or if anybody has. But I think I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of scouting right now. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to, like, leave here, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to turn my energy down to four, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go up to column one, row three.\nNICK: Eugene, now with four energy left, is going to keep going west. He\u0026rsquo;s a straightforward guy, so he\u0026rsquo;s going to go into a straight line until something distracts him.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to pick up the card. We\u0026rsquo;re going to reveal it. It is the two of hearts. Alright. The two, the symbol is a circle. There\u0026rsquo;s a circle. I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw… a little line through it. It also kind of looks like a hammer now because I started the line a little bit close to the top edge of the circle and went right through the bottom of it.\nNow we have discovered another creature card. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that this is also kind of a bird, but it\u0026rsquo;s more of a– more of like a secretary bird. Like this is– this is like a secretary bird meets a red kangaroo. So it\u0026rsquo;s tall, it\u0026rsquo;s lanky. It\u0026rsquo;s got the trademark claws of the secretary bird and the extremely jacked physique of the red kangaroo. Like this- this is a creature that looks like it\u0026rsquo;s going to kick you in the next week if your chest isn\u0026rsquo;t actually just eviscerated by the claws on the end of it.\nThis definitely could have been descended from a velociraptor.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s currently chasing after something small, something furry, but also kind of reptilian. Everything seems to be descended from reptiles on this planet so far. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I haven\u0026rsquo;t watched any Jurassic Park or anything recently, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know where I\u0026rsquo;m at. It\u0026rsquo;s just where my head\u0026rsquo;s taking me.\nOkay, so what I think Eugene\u0026rsquo;s going to do is… take a moment. He\u0026rsquo;s going to think to himself that he\u0026rsquo;s been paid to figure out what happened. Uh, he just got his first clue– well, his second clue. He found out that there was intelligent life here and they\u0026rsquo;re dead, uh– as far as he knows they\u0026rsquo;re all dead but the lights are still on. The lights are still on. The technology is still working and the technology is also trying to tell him something.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s going to remind himself that he is a veteran mercenary, that he is reliable. Remember we said that he\u0026rsquo;s grumpy. He\u0026rsquo;s reliable. So far– I think right now I have been misportraying him, um. The previous action, he\u0026rsquo;s just kind of moved forward and he\u0026rsquo;s like– I feel like he\u0026rsquo;s running from things. Um, we\u0026rsquo;re gonna play that up a little bit.\nI think, in Eugene\u0026rsquo;s words…\nNICK AS EUGENE: That was unnerving. I, um, really don\u0026rsquo;t like my mind being probed like that. I\u0026rsquo;m used to combat scenarios but not… I don\u0026rsquo;t like being forced into things before I\u0026rsquo;m prepared. I need to take a moment. Reassess. Maybe go back to my ship. The Gargantuan has a couple of extra things for situations like this. I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether to go back the way I came, or see if I can find a way around to avoid the wildlife here and maybe not get into whatever that was back at that lab before I have what I think I might need to explore that further.\nCome on, Eugene. What are we going to do?\nSouth. There\u0026rsquo;s a trail going south. Looks like there might be a vantage point there. Probably surveyed the surrounding area. Maybe I can get more of a clue of what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\nWhat was that spore cloud? Why do I even know it\u0026rsquo;s a spore cloud? There must have been some sort of– some sort of things communicated non-verbally and my brain is just starting to fill in the gaps by itself.\nIs that what\u0026rsquo;s happening? I\u0026rsquo;m not equipped for these kind of things. I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to go in, find the treasure, leave. The threats are usually terrestrial. Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;re extraterrestrial. Sometimes… it\u0026rsquo;s usually something that breathes, something that bleeds, something that shoots back. I\u0026rsquo;ve never dealt with things that just eat. That don\u0026rsquo;t have a form like this. This is… damn it! Eugene, you got this. Breathe. Breathe. In. Out. Heracles, lower the adrenal input. Calming. Calming. Calming. Calming.\nOkay. Alright. Let\u0026rsquo;s go south.\nSATAH: Two of spades. Two is a circle. Okay. I have drawn two circles that are overlapping, kind of like a Venn diagram with not a lot of stuff in common. And again, spades: a vestige.\nOoh. So I keep cracking open these containers and at least the next few also still just have those unmarked boxes, which is starting to get unsettling and also annoying because I\u0026rsquo;m looking for specific kind of materials.\nAnd what this is– the Venn diagram made me think of like data. And so in one of them, finally– I think what it actually looks like is that this one didn\u0026rsquo;t get fully packed, almost as if it was sent in a hurry. And they were like, \u0026ldquo;Truck\u0026rsquo;s leaving, truck\u0026rsquo;s leaving. Ship\u0026rsquo;s leaving. We don\u0026rsquo;t have time. Shove in as much as you can. It\u0026rsquo;s got to go.\u0026rdquo; And so it\u0026rsquo;s a little more haphazard in here.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not perfectly– like a lot of the other ones, everything\u0026rsquo;s strapped in, it looks like it hasn\u0026rsquo;t moved in ages. It didn\u0026rsquo;t move in flight. It\u0026rsquo;s just strapped down perfectly. This one\u0026rsquo;s a little more chaotic. And there\u0026rsquo;s a clipboard with… I think I\u0026rsquo;ll make it, like, it\u0026rsquo;s a language I can\u0026rsquo;t read, but there are charts on it. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they\u0026rsquo;re measuring. Or… really any other details, but I can– I recognize a graph when I see it, you know? I don\u0026rsquo;t– I can\u0026rsquo;t read the language, so I have no idea what number is going up, but I can tell that number go up for sure.\nAnd I think I just… is it literally a clipboard or is it like a data pad that still for some reason has battery? Oh, I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a- it\u0026rsquo;s a clipboard because this is shifty, right? They- they were doing all of this, like, not digitally as much as possible so that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t get hacked or recorded or… or who knows what their exact motivations were. But it\u0026rsquo;s paper. And that\u0026rsquo;s actually kind of a weird thing.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m going to take it. And uh… do I have direct communication to my crew? … Yes, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s constant. I have to call them. And I\u0026rsquo;m not going to call them just to say what this is. But… I like the idea that that\u0026rsquo;s even true of- of data transfer here. Like, I could send them a picture of this to start translating it, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t like texting a picture. We have to establish a connection and then I send the picture. I call them to be able to send it.\nAnd so I just– I take pictures and I take the clipboard and I\u0026rsquo;m thinking– I\u0026rsquo;m like, when I call them later to like say what\u0026rsquo;s up, I\u0026rsquo;ll send this picture then, and hopefully one of my cool linguist… clone siblings can start translating it or recognizing it.\nNICK: We have three energy left and we have discovered the nine of clubs. The nine is a half circle. I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a little arrow symbol on the bottom of that half circle, so it looks like a turn. Clubs is landscape. This is perfect.\nLike, Eugene thought when he looked down the south way there is a trail and it does indeed lead to a cliff face. Um, the cliff face is overlooking the research lab and it\u0026rsquo;s overlooking where the um… oh we didn\u0026rsquo;t name the creature from the last card. Uh, we\u0026rsquo;re gonna name it the boss bird. So it\u0026rsquo;s an upgrade to the secretary bird.\nAnd this is the Overlook on nine. And let\u0026rsquo;s see. So what I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do is I\u0026rsquo;m going to immediately camp but unveil every adjacent card to nine.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a solo game. I can adjust rules as I goddamn please.\nOkay, but we will draw our symbols as necessary and go through Eugene\u0026rsquo;s thoughts for each.\nDORIAN: Oh, and we already have our first ace! This is the ace of spades, and let\u0026rsquo;s look up what that means.\n\u0026ldquo;When you uncover an ace, you find a trait that brings you closer to understanding what happened to the planet\u0026rsquo;s missing sapient species. Each ace answers a key question. Check the colour of the ace, then roll the d6 on a corresponding table.\u0026rdquo; The ace of the spades is a black ace, and that means that it speaks to the past. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to uncover an answer that connects to the past of this species who used to live here.\n[Die clunking] One thing about rolling a die is I always feel like my first roll is crap, and I need a do over. So we\u0026rsquo;re not even going to talk about the result. The question seemed interesting enough, but I need something that actually like rolls. [Die rolls] Well, it\u0026rsquo;s the same. It\u0026rsquo;s a one. So I find something that helps me establish \u0026ldquo;what the species values.\u0026rdquo;\nAn ace\u0026rsquo;s trait type does not need to match its suit, so I have full latitude here. Um… so this is interesting because I haven\u0026rsquo;t established too much about this place yet. So I have a lot of free reign in thinking about… what the species valued.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to find a tower. I think it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a watchtower, and I think it is made out of these like reeds or something. Like it\u0026rsquo;s flexible, it\u0026rsquo;s thin, and it is thatched with the woven mats of what I\u0026rsquo;ve started calling the gauze grass. It\u0026rsquo;s run– I mean, it was thatched. The like structure or the frame of the tower has been preserved. I think it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a petrified wood sort of situation. And there\u0026rsquo;s enough evidence in the landscape around it, in, like, traces of, like, ancient, like, weathering– there\u0026rsquo;s evidence that, like, this probably was thatched with gauze grass.\nSo what I\u0026rsquo;m learning that the species valued is making use of the landscape around them and, like, creating things in a way that worked with the landscape rather than imposed their will on it.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m writing that I have found the Reedy Watchtower.\nI am drawing a… awkward little symbol. You should see– I\u0026rsquo;m not a good artist.\nNICK: We revealed the seven of spades to the west. So sevens are curved lines. I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a curved line going like that. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to draw a straight line at the top. You know what, we\u0026rsquo;re going to draw two. So it looks like– almost like that cool S that the millennials had in high school?\nAnd I think it being a spades, it\u0026rsquo;s a vestige. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to say that this was a valley. Both of the sides of the valley have been caved in, though. Eugene can\u0026rsquo;t see what\u0026rsquo;s at the bottom of the valley. It\u0026rsquo;s very deep and the light doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite reach all the way down.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the energy, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t go to the card. So I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know much about what he saw there. He only knows what the landscape looks like over there.\nSATAH: Turn my energy die down to three. It\u0026rsquo;s so funny how bad I am at finding a specific number on a die considering how often– relatively often I interact with them as an object.\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna just keep going up up the column. Row two. The nine of diamonds got our second nine which means our second half circle. Drawing a half circle that is a line sideways… like a c, the letter c. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a couple extra circles around it and inside it so it looks kind of like sideways radio– radio.– a sideways rainbow, or like a sort of broadcasting signal signifier.\nDiamonds are a plant. \u0026ldquo;A thimble-sized bush, a mossy beetle, a box made of woven vines.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I think what this is, is that… I keep moving down the line of these containers. I think I skip a few at this point. I start looking for one that like looks a little bit different, just because I\u0026rsquo;m sick of seeing all the generic boxes in a row.\nAnd I go up, um, and I\u0026rsquo;m walking around to see if it looks different, if it has those animal burrow holes in it, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. What it does have is a series of vines that are clearly coming from inside that were strong enough to pierce the steel wall of this shipping container. And then… I\u0026rsquo;m looking at the curve that I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn. One of the like inexplicable things about it is that the vines then curve back in to grow back into the shipping container.\nSo it almost looks like there are plants growing inside of the container that went to like grow outside and then went, \u0026ldquo;Nope, we don\u0026rsquo;t like that! We\u0026rsquo;re going to go back into the shipping container.\u0026rdquo; And again, with enough force somehow to pierce steel.\nYeah, and I don\u0026rsquo;t go in there because I just immediately, like… I mean, I like plants, right? I know about plants. And I think one of the things that I know because I know about plants is that I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the fuck is going on with these plants. Because that\u0026rsquo;s weird. They should want to get outside, right? They should want light. They shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, like, shying away from it. Makes me think that maybe they, like, need some amount of toxic air or something. Like, this air is breathable for me, and maybe they– this plant, like, needs a different air. I think I\u0026rsquo;m looking– I look at it and like the vines are thick enough that it is essentially– it\u0026rsquo;s plugged up the holes that it\u0026rsquo;s made. But that\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons why it couldn\u0026rsquo;t just retreat in. It couldn\u0026rsquo;t like pull the vine out of the hole that it punched through the wall because it needs it to be plugged, I think, to keep the air in. The nasty air that this plant needs.\nTake a little picture of that. Do I take a sample? Am I a sample taker? No. I think that I do a lot of scouting… like I\u0026rsquo;m very focused on specific like cybernetic stuff. I get sent out to recover the stuff that is relevant to what I do and stuff that I know about. But also I do a lot of, in that process, scouting to send like other members of the crew, but also like teams? Like I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, taking a picture of this weird plant… specific clone sibling who is a scientist, you might want to come and get a sample. If I try and get a sample, I\u0026rsquo;m scared it\u0026rsquo;ll poison me because that\u0026rsquo;s happened before.\u0026rdquo;\nYeah, so I\u0026rsquo;m just, I\u0026rsquo;m taking pictures, I\u0026rsquo;m recording. And if asked, I will come back and take a sample, but I\u0026rsquo;m not doing it until I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to because it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve written, \u0026ldquo;vine that punched through a container, then back in.\u0026rdquo; Uh-oh!\nNICK: So, to the east, we have the Ten of Diamonds. A ten is an arrow. I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw the arrow going east. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to put a little skull at the end of the arrow. The diamond symbol is a plant.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to say that this plant is a gigantic Venus flytrap style plant. One of the boss birds is wandering around this area, and it is immediately eaten by this Venus flytrap. It looks like the boss bird wasn\u0026rsquo;t enticed by anything that the flytrap style plant, um– because normally Venus flytraps, they– I believe what it is is that they emit a certain scent to attract the flies, and that\u0026rsquo;s what gets the flies to land. This thing just looks more like an unassuming plant. And Eugene just really thought that it was just strange flora until the flora ate the bird that passed by. And he looks at that and he goes, \u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;re not going east.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs] That\u0026rsquo;s pretty much all he got from that.\nSATAH: And turning my energy down to two, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go up to the corner. Column one, row one. Three of spades. So three is a triangle. Yay, the best shape! I have drawn two triangles facing away from each other, kind of like up and down arrows in an elevator or volume buttons or something.\nSpades are vestiges. Mmm…\nCould be… volume buttons. Like I go into a container and there\u0026rsquo;s a radio in there, which maybe like is like, ooh, is somebody living in here?\nI am drawn to the idea that it is elevator buttons. As if, like, part of a ship or a building had just been cut up and shoved into this container to be sent away. Yeah, that is such a weird image. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do that.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like I crack open the shipping container and stop dead for a second and just kind of survey it because it really just– there\u0026rsquo;s- there\u0026rsquo;s a wall in there. And there is an elevator. And a big section of the container is taken up by like the elevator shaft that has been crumpled as much as possible to fit in here, folded up and just really shoved in as hard as possible. And there\u0026rsquo;s part of the walls that– the elevator doors, like all of the elevator doors are sort of like neatly stacked, and that\u0026rsquo;s where I see that symbol, the up and down triangles.\nAnd then the elevator is just… strapped in there.\nAnd I think I will tie this to a medical thing in that, like, this was ripped out of a hospital, which I know because I recognise the symbols on– maybe not on the doors, maybe on- in the mechanisms? In something. I\u0026rsquo;m like, oh, that is a chain of private hospitals. Right? Why would they deconstruct a building and like shove it into a shipping container to be brought elsewhere? Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t they like reuse some of the materials or dispose of them sort of in a regular way? This really looks like they were trying to hide something. What is it?\nAnd again, I think Eggo just like stares for a little while and has this like deepening creeping sense of unease and even horror, like, something is so not right here. And they step backwards and shut that door.\nNICK: Ten of spades. Spades are a vestige. And the ten, as we just discovered, is an arrow. We\u0026rsquo;re going to point that arrow going west. And at the end of that arrow is going to be a star.\nSo this vestige is going to be a stone circle. He can see the stone circle, and he can kind of see what looks like… what looks like drag marks. They\u0026rsquo;re very noticeable indents in the dirt.\nEugene has a visor that lets him see a little bit further. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t filter the light or provide light, which is why he really couldn\u0026rsquo;t see the bottom of the caved-in area. But, um, from this side, the sunlight is hitting at an angle that allows him to see from south of him fairly easily, but not so much to the west. Honestly, I can\u0026rsquo;t really picture what direction the sun would be to do that, but just buy in with me? Alright, cool.\nYeah, he sees the stone circle. He sees the drags. They\u0026rsquo;re going west, which means that there might be something important right to the west of this Ten of Spades. This Ten of Spades is on the bottom of my map. So somewhere along the bottom of the map, we might be finding something crucial. But we\u0026rsquo;ll find out later.\nSo Eugene is now going to camp.\nSATAH: My energy goes down to one, and that means that I immediately rest, which in the campaign would involve leaving the planet, shuffling the cards back in, laying out a new map, but in the one-shot version, we are just going to do a camping scene and then start a new leg of this journey.\nDORIAN: Camping.\nDORIAN \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Your characters set up camp for a much needed rest. Answer the following questions.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Where do you set up camp?\u0026rdquo; Just outside of this shipping container with the weird crumpled elevator in it. Which is because it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, this is too fucked up for me to just keep going. I\u0026rsquo;m seeing too much weird shit. I got to call the Dead Ringer and discuss some of this to figure out what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do going forward.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not planning on like fully sleeping, but just like chilling and calling home.\nDORIAN: So I think I set up camp like under kind of the– the watchtower? Like, within where its base would have been. Uh and I think, you know, I have a bedroll– like a blanket with me and I sort of– I throw that over like the scaffolding of the watchtower to make a kind of like tent for some shelter from the elements rather than just like sleeping out in a sleeping bag under the stars.\nNICK: So I set up camp and on the top of the cliff face um there\u0026rsquo;s a small grove that overlooks the other points of interest that we discovered. But it\u0026rsquo;s a little secluded enough where I\u0026rsquo;m not going to draw too much attention from myself.\nAs the sun goes down, he sets up his little agency-provided campfire equipment. A tent that pops out from the Herakles system. There\u0026rsquo;s a little compartment in his shoulder– in his pauldrons– pauldrons are on the top of– gauntlet. In his gauntlet that shoots out a little tube. The tube opens up and there is a bar, a bar, a bar, bar, that makes like a little cube that projects like hard light. And the hard light opens up a little bit on the bottom to give him a little crawl space and then closes in when he steps inside. And it lets heat in, does not let other matter in, and that keeps him relatively safe.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Which trait during this leg of the journey was most interesting to each character?\u0026rdquo; Ooh, what was the most interesting to me? Probably the elevator. I think there\u0026rsquo;s been sort of increasing dawning horror, so \u0026ldquo;interest\u0026rdquo; is a strange word in some ways.\nI do think with the farming background, like I am a little drawn to the vine things, but that is so much– that like– that is something that I\u0026rsquo;m so much closer to understanding than whatever\u0026rsquo;s happening in the elevator. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a toss up between the two, but definitely– definitely one of those two.\nDORIAN: I found the gauze grass really interesting. Like I said, I sketched it. I took notes. I think it\u0026rsquo;s really… I want this journey to like reveal more than just a potentially useful plant, but I can take comfort that like, even if I were to be forced home now, I would still have found something that could be useful to my people.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What does each character do during their rest?\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: Y\u0026rsquo;know, I write up my day\u0026rsquo;s worth of travel. I think that is sort of my custom for the end of a day, or what I intend to be my custom; this is only my first night. I want to write up everything I\u0026rsquo;ve seen and my thoughts, and I want to just sort of parse and process it myself. Like, I think when you\u0026rsquo;re doing the day, you\u0026rsquo;re kind of… you\u0026rsquo;re too busy experiencing to really, like, necessarily take the time to sit down and, like, unpack everything that\u0026rsquo;s happened to you. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s the value of the camping for my character, for Gwyn, is it\u0026rsquo;s a chance to do that reflection and to be like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, like, what are the pieces I\u0026rsquo;m putting together?\u0026rdquo;\nThis is probably where they reason out the answer to the question. Like, the fact that the way the structure was built means that these are people who kind of respect or want to work with the land– or at least it implies that. I think, you know, one discovery is not enough to say that with certainty, but it\u0026rsquo;s the direction that their mind is going.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to call. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna call the Dead Ringer and send a bunch of the pictures that I\u0026rsquo;ve collected so far to be like, \u0026ldquo;Hey. This is not straightforward. It\u0026rsquo;s weird. There\u0026rsquo;s weird stuff. What should I do? If you want me to take samples, please advise me on exactly how. And also look up this company and see why the fuck they would have wanted to just throw away an elevator. Thank you.\u0026rdquo;\nDo I have any theories so far? I mean, it is definitely dawning on me that people seem to have been treating this as a place to– like, normally, you know, when a planet like this is abandoned… it certainly gets picked over, but people aren\u0026rsquo;t normally adding new stuff to it? But in this case, it seems like… it\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that this stuff was being shipped here when it was actively being used, though maybe it was. And so… it seems to me like maybe this stuff has been disposed of here using its abandoned dump status as a cover? I\u0026rsquo;m not totally sure but that\u0026rsquo;s– that\u0026rsquo;s kind of the feeling that I\u0026rsquo;m starting to get. Though I do still– I think it has still been a while. Like, those plants had time to grow– though who knows how fast they grow. The– mostly the thing is that those the animal burrows, the holes, looked\nold, so they\u0026rsquo;ve been here for a little while.\nNICK: Let\u0026rsquo;s roll a little d6. [Die rolling]\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Once you\u0026rsquo;ve answered the questions, roll the d6 on the camp scene table.\u0026rdquo; [Die clattering] Four. A deeper understanding. Ooh. Okay.\nThere are a few different directions to go here. And it makes sense because I\u0026rsquo;m in conversation with home base, the Dead Ringer, and they\u0026rsquo;re sort of like providing insight on some of the stuff that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen.\nProcess of elimination. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s greater understanding of the plants because I think– I really think that there would need to be a physical examination of some kind to see what\u0026rsquo;s going on there. It seems unlikely that it\u0026rsquo;s understanding where the unmarked containers came from because they\u0026rsquo;re so purposefully… unmarked, right? It could be something about the like data and the manifest that I saw, or it could be something about the elevator.\nI think they\u0026rsquo;re still working on translating… the manifest. In part because that\u0026rsquo;ll lead to more information about the unmarked containers, right? Because it was found in a container full of those.\nAnd so it\u0026rsquo;s not a full understanding of what went on with the building and the elevator, but it\u0026rsquo;s like… someone manages to find information on a building that this corporation, these private hospitals… got rid of in a hurry. And I think that they– the thing that they find is like– is an article talking about– it\u0026rsquo;s very much a puff piece? Clearly sort of like created by that corporation that like vaguely alludes to \u0026ldquo;an incident\u0026rdquo; and how they\u0026rsquo;re taking it as an opportunity to upgrade their facilities, and assuring the public that it\u0026rsquo;s all been dealt with. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have any details.\nBut part of what I– what we are like coming to understand is that there was a capital I Incident in one of these private hospitals and this corporation was so terrified of details of that being understood that they vanished the hospital. Just razed it to the ground. Had it broken into component parts and- and sent possibly to a bunch of different locations. Maybe all here. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep– we\u0026rsquo;ll see what we find in the rest of these containers.\nBut… yeah, we definitely learned that. Do I want to have a slightly better understanding? Like, can we find an article that actually talks about what the incident was? Or is it too far buried and maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out later?\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m starting to think about this, I\u0026rsquo;m also trying to figure out some genre stuff. Like… is the elevator haunted? Is that something I want to be real? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I\u0026rsquo;m genuinely not sure.\nWhich I think means I\u0026rsquo;m going to settle for they can only find the corporate puff piece right now. Information about the actual incident has been buried. They\u0026rsquo;re going to start looking. They\u0026rsquo;re going to be digging into it while I continue to wander around this planet. And also trying to translate that manifest that I sent them pictures of.\nDORIAN: Then we have a camp scene.\nNICK: I got a two on that. So it\u0026rsquo;s a resurfaced memory.\nDORIAN: Which is a resurfaced memory.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s pretty interesting, I think, because I haven\u0026rsquo;t done too much to define Gwyn\u0026rsquo;s past or memories.\nNICK: Eugene sits down by the fire and he starts to think about himself. And maybe… maybe this is why he instinctively moved away from that lab.\nHe himself is the result of some lab experiments gone wrong. And what I think he instinctively uncovered was that this was something similar, perhaps even from the same company, because this is his home star system. It just happens to be that this planet itself was undiscovered.\nThis time period that he lives in, man has only recently achieved interstellar travel. So they\u0026rsquo;re only maybe like 200 light years from Earth. The hyperdrive\u0026rsquo;s giving them a couple of light years in a day or two. They\u0026rsquo;ve found some very Earth-like system– Earth-like planets around… this– around Eureka. Repopulated those planets and have developed new civilisations with new roles and better people and less cops. [Laughs] You know, uh, collapse happened. A lot of it is just going through those growing pains again until people have figured out a way to live with each other. But we won\u0026rsquo;t go too far into that.\nBut we will go into what Eugene has been thinking about his time being experimented on. The Herakles system is not unique to him, but it is unique in how it\u0026rsquo;s responded to his body. Eugene is capable of superhuman feats. He is not superhumanly durable, though. So he can fight. He fights very well. He jumps really high. He\u0026rsquo;s extremely strong. The Herakles system, if it\u0026rsquo;s overused, it… it has adverse effects on his heart, so he needs to take frequent breaks when he\u0026rsquo;s activated it. So he\u0026rsquo;s very not particularly comfortable with relying on it, and he\u0026rsquo;s absolutely not comfortable with using the illegal upgrades that he\u0026rsquo;s needed to maintain it. There\u0026rsquo;s been some legislation on humanoid manipulation– like, uh, manipulating organic sentient beings with technology.\nAnd he\u0026rsquo;s been pondering that. He\u0026rsquo;s pondering the events that led to things like the Herakles system being developed and even needing to be developed. Was there a need for it?\nThis is me going off topic a little bit, but I feel like there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of things that we do today that is… the result of people that are very capable in a way of making feats happen, but not so capable in understanding the implications of what they\u0026rsquo;ve done and what they might do. And I feel like there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of yourself in every character. TL;DR, uh, Eugene has some thoughts on this. [Laughs]\nDORIAN: A resurfaced memory from the experiences I\u0026rsquo;ve had today.\nUm… I think Gwyn hasn\u0026rsquo;t been alone very much in their life, like truly alone. I think they have a pretty tight-knit family. And then, of course, like, this is a society that\u0026rsquo;s into learning and stuff like that. So I imagine there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of, like, sort of communal, like, teaching of younger people. And that includes, like, young adults. So I think a lot of people aren\u0026rsquo;t alone very much until they go out on this journey by themselves.\nAnd so Gwyn is remembering some period, like, a number of years ago where they got to be alone. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a period of time, like, just a little bit between, um– you know, during the years you\u0026rsquo;re growing up, like there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of a break between like different like eras of schooling, as it were. And so you get a little time to sort of like explore independently within the community and within your like home territory as a way of preparing yourself and like setting yourself up for the longer journey that you will take a few years later. And so Gwyn is remembering that and is remembering specifically like that they like being alone with their thoughts. That like… you know, maybe they incline towards being kind of a solitary person and they\u0026rsquo;re in a society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily allow for that very much.\nSo they\u0026rsquo;re remembering just like being alone with a journal. And I think they used to use a journal to kind of invent stories or speculate about stuff, and so they\u0026rsquo;re remembering that and kind of like comparing it to what they\u0026rsquo;re doing now, discovering stuff– and I think– and like putting clues together in that way. And I think they like the latter better, but… there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of nostalgia for when, you know, they could just kind of, like, write things or invent details without having to, like, connect them to stuff that they\u0026rsquo;ve actually, like, observed or figured out.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the first leg of my journey!\nSATAH: And we\u0026rsquo;ll start leg two!\nDORIAN: So I\u0026rsquo;ve started kind of, like, doing a spiraling out kind of thing, and I see no reason not to continue with that. So that is what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do. I\u0026rsquo;ve passed through the center of the map, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to work my way outward from there, from the ace that I\u0026rsquo;ve stopped at.\nSo we have found the six of diamonds. I remember diamonds are a plant… and a six is straight lines. So I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a few straight lines.\nAnd I think what these are is, having found the tower, I want to find the sort of like reeds that it was built out of. So I go digging a bit, and I find– not literally in the earth. But I like, I look around, I explore, I wander, and I find this like stand of these bamboo-like plants along the bank of a river.\nAnd these plants are… again, they\u0026rsquo;re sort of reddish. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen Japanese knotweed, which is like a major garden, like invasive garden pests around where I live. But it\u0026rsquo;s like, it\u0026rsquo;s a very dark red and then around kind of the joints, which are a little knobby, it gets a little bit lighter. So I think these are like that, but you know, they\u0026rsquo;re much like thicker, more robust, a lot more like bamboo. And they have these gorgeous, like sort of like globes of flowers at the end, kind of like a… I\u0026rsquo;m so bad at flowers you guys. But like, you know, you can imagine like a Queen Anne\u0026rsquo;s lace, except instead of like a flat like burst of little flowers, it is a sphere.\nSo they\u0026rsquo;re very pretty. And I, you know, I sketch them, I take a little note. And then I… I think I decide to follow the river for a while.\nNICK: So he wakes up, he steps out of his hard light tent, he presses a button on the Heracles system\u0026rsquo;s gauntlet, and the tent tube goes right back into the gauntlet from whence it came.\nThe sun unveils a new day. He looks down from the overlook, he sees the cave-in to the west, he sees the stone circle to the south, and he sees a nope to the east and a nope to the north. But the bigger nope is to the east. He does not want to deal with the giant boss bird eating plant, which we are going to call a Bird Nest.\nSo I think what he\u0026rsquo;s going to do is he\u0026rsquo;s going to head back north. The lab is calling him. His memories have triggered in such a way where he\u0026rsquo;s thinking that there might be something that could be uncovered if he goes back in there and re-explores it. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do. We\u0026rsquo;re going to go north.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve encountered the Boss Bird again. Alright, \u0026ldquo;If you have not yet filled all four margins of the card, add any detail about the trait to one of the empty margins.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m thinking what we might answer is \u0026ldquo;what unexpected feeling or memory does this trait evoke?\u0026rdquo; Eugene\u0026rsquo;s discovery of the Boss Bird really reminds him of another trip that he\u0026rsquo;s made for a different employer. He was on a desert planet and he encountered what looked like a cheetah. It was very fast like a cheetah, but it was so much stronger. Cheetahs in nature are typically bullied by other predators in Africa and that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case here. This cheetah for some reason had all of the aspects that make cheetahs on Earth effective as far as their speed but this cheetah had a much larger head. It was aerodynamic and it did not hamper the cheetah\u0026rsquo;s top speed at all but what it did do is give it increased bite force in a way that let it compete with other animals on the planet and this um– this made Eugene remember… man has done a lot of genetic mutations with animals and sometimes it goes well. And they had been experimenting with a lot of the genetic mutation stuff in unpopulated planets and trying to develop ecosystems in a way that they could hunt and do animal husbandry in new ways.\nEugene is just reminded of that. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to write mutation advancements on the right side of that card. His energy has dropped down to five.\nSATAH: Turning my energy die back to six. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go right over, start walking along the row. Column two, row one. Four of hearts. Four is a square. I have drawn two squares with a line connecting them, which could be a little bit looking kind of like a square pair of glasses. Hearts are creatures.\nSo I think what this is… this is not… there is no, like, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to directly– I\u0026rsquo;m not going to put animal harm on screen, but it will be implied in that these are… I\u0026rsquo;m looking at the squares and how they\u0026rsquo;re connected, and it made me think of rat cages that have, like, tubes between them for enrichment, you know? And I think that, again, cracking open another shipping container, this is another bunch of material probably from that hospital that is, like, a medical testing wing that they\u0026rsquo;ve just dismantled. There\u0026rsquo;s, like, no reason to believe that animals were put in here, but clearly they were experimented on, as is often the case.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s just… yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s just a bunch of equipment. And this one I definitely do tag as, like, this is strictly relevant to me, potentially. There might be, like– because it\u0026rsquo;s the whole wing. Like, it really just looks like they… almost like they tipped the room open and just poured it in here, which means there could be like medical supplies and parts and that kind of thing that would be helpful for machine maintenance and cybernetic upgrade. Ooh, there might even be like painkillers or drugs or that kind of thing, like the type of stuff that they would just have on hand for that.\nNICK: And we\u0026rsquo;re going to go back to the research lab, dropping his energy down to four. What we have to do here is, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;ve already encountered his face card, describe how the situation changes, escalates, or gains new context. Other players may provide additional details to the same.\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;re playing solo, so this is just on me.\nAgain, this is the King of Spades. So the King of Spades means \u0026ldquo;the vestige contradicts an assumption.\u0026rdquo; And we\u0026rsquo;ve already contradicted that the research was still there. But he thought that the research was going to be on the computers. It might be like some paper or something.\nThe research is gone because the computer systems, other than that capsule, were destroyed. But there has to be a trace of something here. So when Eugene steps back into the research lab, he powers up the Herakles system. He looks around. He steps past the capsule, and he starts exploring the loading bay. He sees that, um… it\u0026rsquo;s extremely clean here. It\u0026rsquo;s clinically clean in a place where people work and that tends to be dirty because there\u0026rsquo;s a dock. There\u0026rsquo;s things to, well, unload. There\u0026rsquo;s actually an old ship that is also, like, oddly pristine that has been sitting there for quite some time. But if he hadn\u0026rsquo;t had those images placed into his head, he would not have known that because there\u0026rsquo;s no trace of age. There\u0026rsquo;s no trace of any sort of rust or any like natural decay. Anything that would indicate that time has passed here.\nHe discovers some glass. There are some crates that were open and um they\u0026rsquo;re turned over and it looks like shards of glass have been spread all over the floor. It looks like there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of blood on the glass and it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s definitely– it\u0026rsquo;s dry. It\u0026rsquo;s crusty. It\u0026rsquo;s very dark. It\u0026rsquo;s blood that\u0026rsquo;s been sitting there for quite some time. Which, compared to the rest of the clinically clean atmosphere that he\u0026rsquo;s been in, that looks like that- not even bacteria is present, this one spot is eerily contrasting.\nNICK, AS EUGENE: This doesn\u0026rsquo;t add up. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t add up at all. Herakles system. Reroute power to cognitive function, to vision. I need to analyse this material.\nNICK: The Herakles system responds non-verbally, just giving a beep that can only be heard within Eugene\u0026rsquo;s own head. He has sonar implants within his ears that are subdermal. You can\u0026rsquo;t see them. But if you were to inspect him very closely, you can see the incision marks behind his earlobes. But he keeps his hair very like… neat and tidy but covering his ears so like you\u0026rsquo;d really have to like be comfortable– he\u0026rsquo;d have to really be comfortable with you for you to find out that he has those implants. But it\u0026rsquo;s also not particularly hard to extrapolate because the neural– the adrenal ports on the back of his neck are not covered by his hair. His hair doesn\u0026rsquo;t grow long enough to to get down that far. It\u0026rsquo;s more like on, uh, between the shoulder blades on his spine.\nHe doesn\u0026rsquo;t have like a heads up display or anything. What it really is– it\u0026rsquo;s more just kind of like a– like an intravenous kind of injection thing that goes into his brain and like directly to his optical nerves to like hyperactivate them, which hurts like shit. But– so he- he grimaces a little bit and he- he kind of like strains, but like when he starts to adjust to the pain a little bit and his eyes start to focus, he can see exactly what\u0026rsquo;s going on with the blood and what happened.\nHe can see that it\u0026rsquo;s been eaten away a little bit. The glass itself is almost completely unmolested as far as its structure. Eugene is not exactly a highly qualified scientist, but there\u0026rsquo;s some things that you have to know to do his job, and, um, he\u0026rsquo;s able to extrapolate from what he notices from the blood and from what he notices from the nature of that glass and comparing it to the other metals in the area to understand that there\u0026rsquo;s something specific about the glass and anything that that glass is touching that has kept the microbes and the spores from interfering with it.\nNICK, AS EUGENE: If I had to take a guess… I think that this might have been where they kept the cloud. We\u0026rsquo;re going to call it… Thanatos.\nSo the Thanatos spore must be contained by this specific type of glass. I will have to take a sample of it and bring it in for analysis when I return to base. At the moment, it seems that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite want the metals, but it will eat through metal. This is just my initial thoughts.\nScout log day two. Add everything I\u0026rsquo;ve said. We\u0026rsquo;ll update my findings tomorrow. For now, I need to explore more.\nNICK: So we\u0026rsquo;re going to drop his energy down to three. And on this card, we\u0026rsquo;re going to add special containment glass onto the margin.\nDORIAN: I don\u0026rsquo;t have fingernails. That\u0026rsquo;s the problem. If I had fingernails, this would be so, so simple.\nOh my goodness! You know, we are already at the second day. So this is a short day.\nSATAH: Turn my energy down to five and I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep walking along the row. [Gasps] My first ace.\nNICK: And without doing another scene, because that last scene went a little long, I\u0026rsquo;m going to add another discovery there before I move on.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re going to say that this discovery was specifically about what the, um, Thanatos Spore is after. He has hypothesis: carnivore. There\u0026rsquo;s something that he needs to check before we get the final margin for this card. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to put it down– drop his energy down to two, and go back to the landing pad.\nDORIAN: So I think… I follow the river for a bit, but not for very long before I run into a red ace, which answers a key question about the present. This is question three: \u0026ldquo;What has been preserved?\u0026rdquo; What do I find and how does it speak to what has been preserved?\nI think I find a larger settlement. And I think these people had sort of like domed buildings? Like the Watchtower was made out of reeds and it\u0026rsquo;s quite tall. But they have these domed buildings near the sides of, um– near the banks of the river and they\u0026rsquo;re made out of like river clay largely. And so that has hardened and it\u0026rsquo;s, um– you know, they\u0026rsquo;re obviously quite old, but they\u0026rsquo;ve stayed intact for the most part.\nAnd when I go inside, most of them aren\u0026rsquo;t large. The larger ones I think are a bit more damaged, but it looks like they have– like the furniture such as it is is pretty– pretty simple, not decorative. I think whatever decorations they used haven\u0026rsquo;t really been preserved, but the furniture is like built right into the walls almost of these domed clay dwellings. And so like going into one of them, you can see kind of like the shape of the living spaces that these people use kind of as like an echo or a shadow of– of how their homes would have been laid out.\nSo what has been preserved is sort of their houses and the kind of floor plans of them.\nNICK: He returns to the Pyramid Peckers, eating at the corpses of what he assumes were the scientists and the landing dock workers trying to escape. And he notices something.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see. This is the Three of Hearts. The hearts are a creature. He notices something about the creature.\nThe Pyramid Pecker has been eating things that should have been already devoured by the cloud, and it itself looks like it might have been affected by it a little bit. Eugene isn\u0026rsquo;t really sure how, but… the bodies, on closer examination– it looks like a lot of it has already been devoured, but there\u0026rsquo;s no- there\u0026rsquo;s no signs of tearing or shredding from what an animal– there\u0026rsquo;s no animal-style injuries on these cadaver. What it looks like more is that these have mostly been eaten away by whatever the, uh, the Thanatos spore. But it seems that the spore itself works slowly. Much, much slower than his memories from the capsule would have let on.\nThe Pecker is avoiding some of the corpses. And Eugene doesn\u0026rsquo;t know why yet. So what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do is add a note that the Pecker is particular.\nSATAH: The ace of diamonds. Okay: \u0026ldquo;discovering the ace. When you uncover an ace you find a trait that brings you closer to understanding what happened to the planet\u0026rsquo;s missing sapient species,\u0026rdquo; which– I think I have been playing as if I don\u0026rsquo;t– I have no knowledge of that as a thing. Which I think is fun, so– but I think that whatever this is it is going to somehow be like, \u0026ldquo;Oh shit, people were here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Each ace answers a key question. Check the colour of the ace and roll the d6 on the corresponding table. Re-roll if you get a question you\u0026rsquo;ve already answered.\u0026rdquo; So this is an ace of diamonds, so it is red. Three. \u0026ldquo;What has been preserved?\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s… [Laughing] potentially quite dark in the context of all the weird medical stuff I\u0026rsquo;m talking about.\nWhat is the ace\u0026rsquo;s trait? \u0026ldquo;The ace\u0026rsquo;s trait type does not need to match its suit.\u0026rdquo; Probably will, because I love to be guided.\nDiamond is a plant. Okay. \u0026ldquo;How does this trait answer the key question?\u0026rdquo;\nThe first thing I thought of is that I crack open one of these shipping containers and it is a little micro farm. Is there another direction I want to go?\nI\u0026rsquo;m thinking… could be evidence of like… plant fibers being woven into something?\nMmm. Yeah, okay. So I crack open this container and I think, retroactively, as I\u0026rsquo;m looking at what is in here, I kind of think distantly like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that was a lot easier to open than I expected,\u0026rdquo; as if it\u0026rsquo;s already been opened before.\nAnd what– the thing that is in here is, um… there are like reeds that are growing or there\u0026rsquo;s a long grass that grows here. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s an odd colour, makes it very distinctive. And it\u0026rsquo;s a weird texture, which– not sure if that was here or if it was terraformed or– if it\u0026rsquo;s been- if it was- if it was different and then evolved because of some of the shit that\u0026rsquo;s been dumped here. But there is like distinctive grass on this planet.\nAnd in this shipping container is like a loom or some sort of setup that really makes it look like clearly somebody was in this container, like processing this grass into fabric. To build- to make clothes and materials. I have the image of a big sail for some reason. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if there\u0026rsquo;s water on this planet. You\u0026rsquo;d hope not, if they decided to use it as a dump. But.\nYeah, just someone was in here and they had perfected a process of manually turning this grass into workable fabric. And it\u0026rsquo;s this whole like tiny industrial– not tiny, like, pretty big because these containers are so big– but it\u0026rsquo;s this industrial setup.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s signs of– not signs of life exactly as it was inhabited, but people worked in here. There are places along the wall that are slightly different colours because hands rubbed against them so often. There\u0026rsquo;s like a spot next to the door that\u0026rsquo;s a little shinier because clearly somebody would come in and lean there as they took off their outside shoes.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s all just here. It looks like somebody was in the middle of a project when they- when it stopped. Yeah.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you encountered any other traits that relate to the key question?\u0026rdquo; Not sure yet. I think this is such a like, \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, wait, was somebody living here?\u0026rdquo; That like, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna have to sort of think back and make connections, because that wasn\u0026rsquo;t even an option that was on my mind before.\nWrite a summary… and because this is the one shot, immediately do another camping scene to start a new leg of the journey. Which is something I kind of added just because I think it\u0026rsquo;s a fun framing device.\nNICK: We had an arrow on the Ten of Diamonds pointing to a skull. So that\u0026rsquo;s the Bird Nest. But that arrow probably means something else. So what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is I\u0026rsquo;m going to head south. We\u0026rsquo;re gonna drop our energy down to one. I think dropping my energy down to one immediately goes to camping. Yeah, we unveil all of the trait stuff first and then do step four, which turns the die to one, and then we do a camping scene.\nOkay, so since it\u0026rsquo;s a straight line, I\u0026rsquo;m going to point the straight line down and then add a square. And hearts are creatures. And this creature is going to be a… hm. straight line square. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking this is going to be more of like a– like a dachshund. Like one of those long wiener dogs.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s a group of them. There\u0026rsquo;s a group of very long tubular canine type animals. These don\u0026rsquo;t share the reptilian features that Eugene has discovered on the Boss Bird or the Pyramid Pecker, so what he\u0026rsquo;s assuming is that these may be native to Eureka.\nThey don\u0026rsquo;t pay Eugene any mind. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be what they would normally expect to see on Eureka. Or perhaps he is. Though the researchers were alien, they were humanoid. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think that these animals… have had any particularly negative interactions with the staff of the Eureka\u0026rsquo;s laboratory that\u0026rsquo;s nearby. But so they, yeah, they don\u0026rsquo;t really care.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;re going to call them Canis Longus, just to give it a science fiction-y kind of name compared to the shit that Eugene has been calling other stuff. And then we\u0026rsquo;ll go to the camp scene.\nDORIAN: Alright, and already it is back to camping. I think exploring this like\u0026hellip; abandoned almost like fossilised village you know takes up- takes up most of a day. Like walking along the river until I found it took a decent amount of time and then, uh, exploring it takes longer.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Where do you set up camp?\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: I briefly consider sleeping on one of like the bed ledges within one of the domes but it feels too weird. It feels a little bit haunted. Like it feels a little bit– I don\u0026rsquo;t think I believe in ghosts but like sleeping on the bed of someone who, you know, maybe has not been there for centuries is just a little too like intimate and strange?\nSo where I set up camp is a little bit away from the buildings with my tent, with my bedroll. Sort of like near the riverbank but not so much that the ground is soggy.\nSATAH: I think that I am resting in this shipping container, in this… loom… room. To call– again to call, uh, and be like, \u0026ldquo;Hey. Am I in danger? Is this an– is- is this inhabited? Like, what\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: Uh, \u0026ldquo;Which trait during the leg of the journey was the most interesting to each character?\u0026rdquo; It was obviously these houses. I think I find these fascinating. I think they\u0026rsquo;re really unlike however it is my people build. I think we probably use like pretty conventional, like, buildings and architecture in a way that, you know, that humans on Earth would recognise. Like maybe we mostly build with wood. But like our buildings are, you know, made out of many disparate pieces that all like come together and are joined in various ways. And then our furniture is obviously completely separate. So these like single form dwellings that look almost like they were like grown out of the mud are like super different for me and super fascinating.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Which trait during this leg of the journey was most interesting to each character?\u0026rdquo; There\u0026rsquo;s only been the two and boy, this one sure says a lot more than the animal experimentation wing. Comes out on top.\nDORIAN: And what I do during my rest is, you know, I… whereas with previous things I\u0026rsquo;ve sketched sort of like one example, I think I spend a while like sketching sort of like the layout of this village and like I sketch, you know, know different scenes of like the insides of these smaller dwellings. I try and reconstruct like what the– what the larger sort of like communal buildings must have looked like. These are the ones that have kind of collapsed under their weight over the the intervening years.\nSo like I think I\u0026rsquo;m really trying to puzzle it out and that\u0026rsquo;s what I do during my rest.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What does each character do during their rest?\u0026rdquo; Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m going to call the Dead Ringer and say, \u0026ldquo;Hey, it\u0026rsquo;s me again. Update. Am I not alone on this planet? Because that\u0026rsquo;s a different risk assessment. What\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s certainly no– there must not be any surface level evidence of anyone ever having lived here because we would have known that coming in. But now this is another thing that home base, the Dead Ringer, is starting to dig into.\nNICK: Rolling the d6. We got a five.\nDORIAN: Camp scene. [Die rolling]\nSATAH: Roll for my camp scene.\nDORIAN: I\u0026rsquo;m not doing a resurfaced memory again. I\u0026rsquo;m simply going to reroll.\nNICK: So, \u0026ldquo;strange sight.\u0026rdquo; We have, honestly, when he starts to set up his camp, the dachshunds start to encircle his camp, and then they all, like, beg a little bit. Like, they get on their back legs and start panting. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like they\u0026rsquo;re expecting food. Eugene ignores them and dims the hard light a little bit. And the dachshunds, I think, have been adapted to this behaviour and realise that that means that there\u0026rsquo;s no food here and they all go away.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;A deeper understanding.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Another four, \u0026ldquo;deeper understanding.\u0026rdquo; Cool.\nDORIAN: I was thinking about this. I think as I\u0026rsquo;m sketching out the layout of this settlement, I think I figure out something about, like, how these people structured their society. I think like… we\u0026rsquo;ve already established that I come from a pretty communal group of people. And so I think that whoever lived here before wasn\u0026rsquo;t that. I think it is like mostly single dwellings, like maybe even stuff that would only really be sized to fit one person mostly, with like a couple of, like, larger ones that are enough for, you know, like two to three people if the people were around my size. So like a small family. And then like there\u0026rsquo;s only really one or two like large sort of like things that– remnants that might have been a community building. So like– and I think those are– they would be very central for my people, but I think those are near the edge.\nAnd so like, I\u0026rsquo;m getting the sense that like this- these were pretty atomized people. Like they led largely individual lives and then they sort of only came together under unusual circumstances and spaces that weren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily used very much and that were sort of out of the way of the kind of core environment. So that\u0026rsquo;s very different. And I\u0026rsquo;m starting to realise that because of the work I\u0026rsquo;ve done to sketch this place.\nSATAH: This is going to be about the elevator. And it is essentially going to be… elevator\u0026rsquo;s haunted. But hashtag sci-fi. Because I think what it is, what we find out, is that, like, there was an AI in the elevator– little Muzak AI– that gained sapience, or… maybe they pushed it to have sapience because they were like… \u0026ldquo;Ooh, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to have to push buttons anymore! The elevator will be able to talk to you and figure out where you need to go!\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s like almost like replacing an information desk. Like, \u0026ldquo;Now you can just step into the elevator and be like, \u0026lsquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m looking for this person,\u0026rsquo; and the little AI will be able to tell you where they are. It could just be a non-sapient directory, but we love to shove people into things for some reason.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd anyway, this one didn\u0026rsquo;t like its lot in life very much and became a little bit of a poltergeist. And I think probably… killed a bunch of people… [Laughing] in horrific elevator-based accidents.\nAnd they really wanted to cover this up and did so pretty successfully, but that\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons that it was just hucked off was that they\u0026rsquo;re kind of quarantining the AI too? But not in a responsible, cool way. And we\u0026rsquo;re now like, oh shit, does that mean that the– is the AI still in there? Just trapped? That sucks.\nNot my expertise, but it does mean that I think probably another crew is on the way from the Dead Ringer shortly, or they\u0026rsquo;re out on a job right now, and as soon as they get back, they\u0026rsquo;re going to be headed my way to do some more investigating.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and otherwise self-paced TTRPGs.

So, Eugene has escaped from the Apex Beast. Um, he returns back to the planet. It takes him about a day or two, uh, because he had to trigger the hyperdrive to escape at the last second and that put him a little bit off schedule.\nHe refuels his systems with some synthetic aphrodite on a nearby space station before returning. And he\u0026rsquo;s back and he\u0026rsquo;s fresh. He\u0026rsquo;s got six energy again.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;ll have to do landing the ship again, which I was not expecting to have to do.\nNICK: For to save time, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do the landing the ship section by rolling the dice and then figuring out where we\u0026rsquo;re landing. We\u0026rsquo;re going to land somewhere undiscovered. Uh, so.\nSATAH: I roll a d6 onto the map. Okay, I landed on– I rolled a– oh god, it was either a four or five. I picked it up before I could read it. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but it matters to me.\nI rolled on the card of the… those vines that punched through the container. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have to investigate that again. I can turn my die to six. So my energy is at six.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m going to go over– there is an unmarked, unflipped card right beside, which is in row two, column two.\nDORIAN: I have filled out more than half of this map, so. Like two thirds of it. So those last couple of aces are coming.\nAnd like I spoke it into existence, I\u0026rsquo;ve just turned up the ace of diamonds. So this is going to be a very brief day. You know, I just finished camping and then I find an ace immediately. So this should be a pretty big one. I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend my whole day here because camping again is what happens.\nSo each ace identifies a key question. Red, as a reminder, is the present. [Die rolling] I\u0026rsquo;m… going to reroll, just to see, because I got \u0026ldquo;Where is the species now?\u0026rdquo; and I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I want to or can answer that. I could flesh it out with like what we know as a people, my people. But… I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can answer it with the information I\u0026rsquo;ve found on the planet. Well, I guess part of it is I find a trait that brings me closer to understanding what happened, so… yeah, no, I am going to reroll because most of the possible answers to this I feel like aren\u0026rsquo;t in line with the story I think I\u0026rsquo;m telling. So I am going to fudge it.\n[Die rolling] Well, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do \u0026ldquo;what has been preserved.\u0026rdquo; I did that already. [Die rolling] If I roll what is preserved a third time in a row, fate has spoken, and I\u0026rsquo;ll find another thing that\u0026rsquo;s been preserved, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to.\n[Die rolling] Okay. \u0026ldquo;What has changed since the species disappeared?\u0026rdquo;\nI think what I realise. is that the landscape has changed. Or, like, this plateau is so stark, right? Like, so much of what I\u0026rsquo;ve found so far has been, like, pretty lush. There\u0026rsquo;s been, you know, like, the rich clay and the river. There\u0026rsquo;s been all of these plants. And then I come across this, like, really stark, kind of bare, rocky… area. And I think what I find is…\nIn the night, one of those snake type things has gotten closer to me, uh, which is alarming when I wake up. But like watching it- watching this mammoth thing, um… I think it\u0026rsquo;s sort of scaly, like the lizard things. But I think like being this close, I realise the scales aren\u0026rsquo;t like the scales on the animals I\u0026rsquo;m used to, or the animals we\u0026rsquo;re used to in– on Earth. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure exactly how they\u0026rsquo;re different.\nBut I think this thing, like… it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of, like, visible features on it. But as I watch– I\u0026rsquo;ve been sticking near the end of the edge of the rocky area. So like there\u0026rsquo;s there\u0026rsquo;s area near me that has like some soil and some sort of like scrubby light vegetation. And as I watch, this thing is like moving across that area, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s just– it\u0026rsquo;s eating everything. Like as it moves across, it\u0026rsquo;s almost like, you know, a vacuum or an eraser like moving across- across the land. And I think it does move across like it\u0026rsquo;s not like a snake in that it moves forward led by the head, like– the length of its body is moving like across the land. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like it\u0026rsquo;s leading from the center and kind of undulating. And it\u0026rsquo;s just like– it eats basically everything in its wake.\nAnd behind it, like, the soil\u0026rsquo;s gone. So like these things have been moving across the land. It moves slowly but like it is sweeping sp basically the land behind it and it seems like this rocky plain is kind of the result of these things grazing. And probably it restores itself given time, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know what kind of time frame. And so what has changed is that the landscape itself has changed, and it seems to be partly because of these creatures expanding their territory.\nSATAH: It\u0026rsquo;s the three of clubs. Three is a triangle, the best shape. It\u0026rsquo;s tempting to do the elevators again, but instead I\u0026rsquo;m doing… five triangles that are sort of… close to interlocking, you know? They\u0026rsquo;re all beside each other. Three of them are right side up. Two of them are upside down. So they all just fit together. Could be teeth, even. Closed, bared teeth. Who knows?\nClubs. Landscape. Hmm. Huh.\nIf they were all right side up, it could look like a mountain range. But the interlocking things make it difficult to think… huh.\nSo I think what this is, is that it is actually… it\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of triangular shipping containers. They are built to be able to slot together like this to keep things separate, but take up sort of a minimal footprint. And the thing that\u0026rsquo;s landscape-y about them… first of all, they\u0026rsquo;re huge and there are so many of them. And I think that they\u0026rsquo;ve been built together, slotted together to build this big wall or border or dividing line of some kind. Almost like a big dam or something. And it\u0026rsquo;s just this like intimidating dividing line between… I don\u0026rsquo;t know what, and myself, that I think obviously shows signs of like… they probably weren\u0026rsquo;t just dumped here like this, right? They were- they they were probably moved there on purpose by whoever was living here. But it\u0026rsquo;s just large and looming and intimidating.\nDORIAN: I do think I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna pretend like I camped after finding that, uh– that ace, because I- I don\u0026rsquo;t have it in me to immediately camp and answer questions about only that card. It feels a little weird.\nI am bending rules left and right here. I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily recommend that for playing a game but at the same time, I don\u0026rsquo;t not recommend it! Especially for a solo thing. You get to construct your own story and figure out what works best for that story and for me right now, uh, the pacing necessitates that I forge onward.\nNICK: And this is the eight of spades. Eight symbol is a cross. Spades is a vestige.\nSo this vestige is going to be… oh, what is- what is the term for a, uh… it\u0026rsquo;s like an aquarium but for plants… not a garden.\n[Small sound of effort] Keyboard! You\u0026rsquo;re like way out of where I usually keep you.\nA terrarium. Yeah. That\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re looking for. He\u0026rsquo;s found a terrarium. It\u0026rsquo;s, um- it\u0026rsquo;s a big glass enclosure. It has, like, all of the necessities for managing plant life, and um, there\u0026rsquo;s signs that there was things used to modify the plants. Not in a way that they modify the animals or whatnot, but in a way that they almost like… like, cross-pollinating things in a way?\nSo I think they were trying to do something unique with Aphrodite, and that might have been what got them into the trouble that they got into. But we\u0026rsquo;re going to go north and find out what happens.\nDORIAN: Ten of diamonds. Okay, so we\u0026rsquo;re back with plants, and a ten is an arrow. I\u0026rsquo;ve done two of these already, you\u0026rsquo;d think I would remember.\nAn arrow with plants is kind of interesting… um. Drawing a couple arrows.\nAnd I think because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to really encounter the snake, I\u0026rsquo;m– I head away from it. I\u0026rsquo;m not heading back into the center of the rocky area, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sticking near the border because that is the area that the snake thing kind of was… tracking.\nAnd I think, you know, I go in the direction I think it came from. And I think as I walk along that area for a while, I start to see like these little– not immediately after it, not- that\u0026rsquo;s not the timescale we\u0026rsquo;re talking about. But, like, I do start to see evidence of stuff growing in the cracks in the rock that we established.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s like these like vertical like shoots. They\u0026rsquo;re a little like the bamboo-y plants, but not very, because those grow by the river. But there\u0026rsquo;s new growth. It\u0026rsquo;s coming from like deep in the earth. And so like the fact that the rock is exposed and like some sunlight has started to get into these cracks in the rock is presumably what allowed these plants to start to grow.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to call these, like, The Deep Shoots. So there\u0026rsquo;s new plant life growing amid these rocks. It\u0026rsquo;s not quite as barren a space as it initially seemed.\nSATAH: And I\u0026rsquo;ll turn my energy down to five and flip this card in column three, row two… the king of hearts.\nOkay. This king is holding a sword kind of just slung behind his head very casually with an empty hand put in front of his chest. And I\u0026rsquo;m just going to draw something between the two hands so it looks like he\u0026rsquo;s holding– you know, the two flipped kings. You know how it is, the king and the mirror image of the king. So it just looks like they\u0026rsquo;re stretching something between them or holding something.\nAnd the king of hearts is, \u0026ldquo;The creature follows you.\u0026rdquo;\nSo. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking. I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily want there to be organic life on this planet, but. [Chuckles] If, as seems to be the case, got some androids wandering around who perhaps at one point were part of either– I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they\u0026rsquo;re a hive mind, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they\u0026rsquo;re all independent beings. I don\u0026rsquo;t even fully know if they\u0026rsquo;re sentient or sapient… though I have my suspicions…\nBut if they were doing mad science and Frankensteining, what if they\u0026rsquo;re also doing that when animals die. And creating these strange… little animals that are made up of the parts of other animals? [Laughs]\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if this makes a difference for other people; it\u0026rsquo;s important to me to note that whether or not my character knows this, I am establishing it as true in the universe that this is only done after the animals have died a natural death. They are not killing animals to make their new weird animals. They are just finding dead animals and going, \u0026ldquo;Hey, what if I made a new creature out of you?\u0026rdquo; And it\u0026rsquo;s not painful for them. They are not living in constant agony. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a, like, Sid from Toy Story creating little living hell for a bunch of weird experiments. They\u0026rsquo;re just odd. They\u0026rsquo;re odd. They\u0026rsquo;re unsettling. But they\u0026rsquo;re okay. It looks weird. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? But it lives its whole life and you have to respect that. I think it can dig in the ground for tubers. Etc.\nAnd so, probably because there was a security alert of some kind, it seems, this creature is following me… because it moved in here to keep watch, in part. Or was brought here to act as an alert system or something, or just followed the androids. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. It\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s definitely related to the fact that I was discovered last time I was here, but. They don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be full of malice or anything. There\u0026rsquo;s no mal intent. It is just a strange, almost abstract creature made of three other types of creatures that\u0026rsquo;s following me around.\nHow is that related to what I drew? … Tube. It\u0026rsquo;s part snake. It\u0026rsquo;s part snake! This is a weird snake. Weird snake with weird wings and two… limbs. A snake with arms and wings. The arms usually are just folded up and- and not– they don\u0026rsquo;t really use the arms to propel themselves. It\u0026rsquo;s unclear if they can actually fly, though I suspect they can at least hover. Mostly they just dart around like a snake, but they can use their weird little paws to manipulate objects.\nI love this creature. I understand that I\u0026rsquo;m describing an actual horror, but I love it so much.\nAnd it just starts following me around. And I think it will for a little while.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve written \u0026ldquo;snake with arms and wings follows me,\u0026rdquo; but with a smiley face to indicate it\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nIt okay!\nNICK: Eugene\u0026rsquo;s energy is going to drop down. We uncovered a seven of clubs. Curved lines. Curved lines is a seven. Clubs is a landscape.\nOh… I accidentally kind of made this look like a dick. Alright, well, anyway, this is a landscape, and it kind of looks like a dick, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to just make it like a giant mesa.\nDude, why am I being so phallic today? I said my spaceship looks like a dick. My– this landscape looks like a dick that I drew… like, Freud would have a fucking field day with me right now. [Laughing] Anyway.\nUh, so, yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a mesa. The mesa is definitely going straight up. It\u0026rsquo;s not leaning left or right or anything like that. It\u0026rsquo;s just living its best life.\nUm, with that, we\u0026rsquo;re going to drop our energy to four, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to head west.\nDORIAN: Three of hearts. Now, hearts is a creature. Three is a triangle.\nTriangle is interesting because I\u0026rsquo;ve spent a lot of time like on this fourfold symmetry idea… I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a little, like, sort of, like, almost spiral around that triangle. It reminds me of a seed or something.\nSo I think what I find, um… when I\u0026rsquo;m poking around like some of these sort of like– I think I lever out like one of the pieces of rock to take a look below and get a better look at those plants. And I think I see that at the roots of those plants are something that I think are like… eggs of some kind? They\u0026rsquo;re these sort of like coils, but like they\u0026rsquo;re– it\u0026rsquo;s a– it\u0026rsquo;s an orb. At the first I think they\u0026rsquo;re seeds, but then they\u0026rsquo;re too they\u0026rsquo;re too large for that. And then like I think with some closer careful examination I do realize that they are eggs.\nAnd I don\u0026rsquo;t know for sure that they are the eggs of these rock snakes, but I– I raise the question in my little journal, because I think that\u0026rsquo;s a- a plausible thing based on what I know about you know like life cycles and that kind of thing. If these things are somehow like laying as they proceed, eating everything.\nSATAH: [Laughing] Turn my energy down to four and… go down to column three row three. Ten of clubs. Yes. Ten is an arrow.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn two arrows at kind of a 90 degree angle, looking most of all for sure like the two hands of a clock. And club is a landscape!\nBecause it looks like the hands of a clock, I could be sort of metaphorical with the interpretation and say it\u0026rsquo;s like a landscape that shows time passing… could also be directional and it is something landscapey that is both very tall and very… uh, long… to the right. Does that mean anything?\nYeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s passing of time. It\u0026rsquo;s… for the first time I see structures. The remnants of structures that were built in the distance. But it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, you know, when you\u0026rsquo;re on the highway and you just see collapsed barns at various stages of just not existing anymore? It\u0026rsquo;s that. But most of them are pretty far along. But this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve seen… what looks like a new structure that wasn\u0026rsquo;t just like fully created from one of these– you know, just moving into the shipping container. Like actually building something new.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know who did it. But clearly they haven\u0026rsquo;t been here for a while because they are just very much falling apart.\nDORIAN: The five of hearts, which is a rectangle.\nI think I find like, um… I want it to be some kind of, like, representation. Like the– the prompt for one of the animal things was like a broken statue of a bird. And the idea that I\u0026rsquo;m finding not a literal creature, but a representation of something is– is interesting to me.\nAnd I think, um… I\u0026rsquo;ve sort of been heading back, not exactly in the direction I came, but like back towards like sort of… I\u0026rsquo;m exploring the area around that amphitheater because I\u0026rsquo;m still trying to hope– find, like, more evidence of the people, because they\u0026rsquo;re who I\u0026rsquo;ve decided I\u0026rsquo;m interested in.\nAnd I think I find, like, an area that I think was- was cleared. Where the rock was scraped clean some time ago because there\u0026rsquo;s more of these like shoots and like that kind of growth. Uh, but on one of the larger pieces of rock– it\u0026rsquo;s kind of obscured by the new plants at this point– but there\u0026rsquo;s like, uh, an etching in the– in the rock of– of one of these, uh, these like large snake things. Like, there\u0026rsquo;s a representation of it that these people have drawn.\nAnd I think that, like, I initially just think it\u0026rsquo;s almost like normal wear in the rock because it does sort of like initially start to– like, look a bit like a squiggle. Um, and I identify it as like a representational artwork, though, which makes me think I\u0026rsquo;m getting close to finding something.\nAnd I know I am, because there\u0026rsquo;s only a few cards left.\nSATAH: Turn my energy from four to three. And I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go over to column two in row three, which is the ace of clubs!\nSo. Rolling on the table for black cards… three. \u0026ldquo;What was the species studying?\u0026rdquo; Augh. Cool.\nI mean, shit. They were creating life from death. I guess they specifically weren\u0026rsquo;t, actually. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s interesting. The androids were doing that. What were the constructs, as it were, focused on?\nIt is tempting to still make it related to death. That\u0026rsquo;s because that\u0026rsquo;s also– that\u0026rsquo;s me. Yeah, uh-huh. Carpenter playing a game and being like, \u0026ldquo;I feel like it might be related to wood.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is the trait? Clubs are landscapes, right? But I guess probably a vestige. And the way that the trait… oh, the trait type is– okay, well. So what this is– right. I keep thinking that the trait is like plant, vestige, landscape, creature, but the trait is actually describing what the thing is.\nAnd so what this is, is a bunch of like shredded medical records that were being painstakingly taped back together. And they still have big incomplete parts, but they were trying to reconstruct them. And the thing that they were studying was their own history, as in the history of the people whose bodies created them. Just trying to get a sense of who are the people that I\u0026rsquo;m made of. Who I don\u0026rsquo;t think are all human, by the way. Like, no particular reason to think that they would be. Humans and aliens, whatever. ut as much as possible, trying to trace back, who are the people that I\u0026rsquo;m literally made up of?\nAnd they were probably doing a lot of different types of research into that. They were studying this in a lot of ways, but this is the first indication of it. This is the thing that I find is these taped together shredded medical records that are like grouped into piles and notated a little, maybe? With like, these three people are all Cindy who needed that heart.\nYeah. And I assume that I found these in a shipping container of some kind. That\u0026rsquo;s part of why they\u0026rsquo;re preserved. You know, they haven\u0026rsquo;t just been left out in the elements. I found a weird library– research library shipping container that they made.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you encountered any other traits that relate to the key question?\u0026rdquo; No, not really. Unless the lab explosion was somehow related to this, which is possible, I guess. But… not in a way that\u0026rsquo;s immediately obvious, at least.\n\u0026ldquo;Review the aces and write any new details you\u0026rsquo;ve learned.\u0026rdquo; Nothing yet.\nNICK: We found the King of Hearts. So it\u0026rsquo;s a creature. It\u0026rsquo;s in trouble. And what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do is we\u0026rsquo;re going to say it is the Apex Beast. But this one, I think, is its mate.\nIts mate is being harassed, not by other animals, but by people. These people, they look like– they do look like the aliens from the research lab, but something\u0026rsquo;s happened to them. They\u0026rsquo;re not wearing the garments of those that would work the jobs that would lead them to, uh… to doing the research to- to, um, terraform this place and to- to make it, uh, suitable for- for- for life forms of, like– their type of life form. Or even- even just like, you know, humans and shit.\nBut like, it seems that they- they have, um– they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re almost prehistoric looking. Like they- they have crude weapons. They have like loincloths and shit. Like they\u0026rsquo;re like leather, and it\u0026rsquo;s not– it\u0026rsquo;s not cured leather or anything like that. These are just– these are very, uh– think Flintstones, right? Like, they\u0026rsquo;re– they\u0026rsquo;re, um, furs.\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re hunting this beast. Eugene has had a run-in with this, uh, with this species before. But like he he sees this and there\u0026rsquo;s something that that triggers within him and he yells, \u0026ldquo;Stop! What are you doing?!\u0026rdquo;\nThe humanoids don\u0026rsquo;t respond to him.They continue what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, and they grunt, and they go to attack. The Beast whips out a leg, and just… uh, they don\u0026rsquo;t survive.\nThe Beast looks at Eugene. It roars. Eugene throws his hands up. He backs away. He goes, look, man, I don\u0026rsquo;t want any problems. I\u0026rsquo;m out, yo. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\nThe Beast kind of understands this and snorts a little bit. It holds its ground, and it lets Eugene walk off.\nDORIAN: The nine of diamonds, plants. I think this is my first nine! I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what that is. What shape is that? A half circle. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of fun.\nI think I continue to kind of trace backwards, because I found this place where the growth is a little older, so the snakes presumably passed by longer ago. And as I get past, like– as I see, like, these shoot plants continue to, like, gradually increase in size… and it\u0026rsquo;s gradual. Like, there\u0026rsquo;s hours for each portion of this journey.\nThey kind of open up, like, they have these broad, broad leaves that sort of, like, hang down across their stems, um, and they have kind of, like, a sap to them that I think smells quite pleasant, but is also quite sticky. And I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to put together or suspect that, like, these plants that grow up in the wake of the snakes, like, their extrusions aren\u0026rsquo;t something that the snakes like. So, like, the snakes tend to not, like, circle past the same grazing area repeatedly because of these– these plants that are in the areas that they were.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve only got a few cards left, so I know that my next leg will be my last one, but this is time to camp again!\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to camp in this sort of grove of these plants with their big shield-like leaves. I\u0026rsquo;ve got my tent, so I\u0026rsquo;m not too worried about the sap getting all over me. But the smell, like I said, for me, it\u0026rsquo;s pleasant. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of, um… kind mildly spicy, or, like, aromatic, I guess is the word I\u0026rsquo;m looking for.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Which trait during this leg of the journey was most interesting?\u0026rdquo; Weird creature, for sure.\nAnd then I think also this.\nI think the weird creature is with me. I tried to close the door before it could get in here, but then looked over and it was in here anyway because it just came through one of the burrow holes. But it\u0026rsquo;s just watching me. It\u0026rsquo;s not doing anything. Weirdly rubbing its little paws together, which is unnerving, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to mean anything. It\u0026rsquo;s just weird to see.\nDORIAN: I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s a specific trait I find most interesting on this leg because this leg has been sort of about the cumulative understanding of the kind of, like, ecological cycle that is going on here. I think– I guess I would say if one trait is the most interesting, it\u0026rsquo;s those shoots that I initially noticed, because they\u0026rsquo;re what sort of like clued me into what was starting to happen here.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What do I do during my rest?\u0026rdquo; I think that I\u0026rsquo;m reading these records. Trying to get a sense– I think they\u0026rsquo;re not super meaningful to me. And a lot of them probably are in that language I don\u0026rsquo;t recognise, right? But I\u0026rsquo;m trying to piece together what I can and taking pictures of them to send to the Dead Ringer when I call. Because I don\u0026rsquo;t think I call for this one. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like I have to check in yet, so I\u0026rsquo;m just chilling and reading these records.\nDORIAN: And I start to, you know, I\u0026rsquo;ve been sketching things as I go, but what I do during my rest is I kind of start to, like, sketch my impression of or my idea of the life cycle that is happening here, where these snake things sweep across the landscape, but then when the rock is revealed, these shoots start to grow into these new plants. And the– you know, presumably at some point the eggs of the snakes hatch and something happens and I– you know, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of question marks in the journal around that stage of the process, but I\u0026rsquo;m starting to put something together here.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;ll roll a camp scene. A two, \u0026ldquo;a resurfaced memory.\u0026rdquo;\nI think that what this is, is… I\u0026rsquo;m sitting here parsing through these medical records and I have this, like, flashback moment of going through my own heavily redacted medical records. Finding the non-redacted versions, finally. Maybe being given one and and realising that I\u0026rsquo;m a clone, right? Like, I was- I was living– I didn\u0026rsquo;t know. And didn\u0026rsquo;t believe it. But part of– I was like– I– maybe I was told and I was like. \u0026ldquo;No, that\u0026rsquo;s stupid,\u0026rdquo; and then it lingered with me enough that I started looking into my own past and found that there was stuff I didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to that didn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense? Lik, the equivalent of like calling public health being like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, can I get my immunization records?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;No. … Actually, yes, you can. We\u0026rsquo;ll fax it over.\u0026rdquo; And half of the page has been sharpied out.\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Um… hey, what?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd just, yeah, sitting here and I think feeling… a sudden rush of this like deep empathy, which– do I know yet that these were Frankensteined people? No, probably not. I think that I\u0026rsquo;m still thinking that– I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Maybe these are… maybe there were survivors of experiments here? But it looks like these people all died. I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; But I have this deep rush of empathy for whoever was sitting here trying to go through these confusing records and piece together a story, piece together history in some way, because I had to do the same thing. And I was lucky enough that when I figured it out, I had a clone crew to join and start running through space together and whatever.\nBut. Yeah. I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about that in a while because I… it\u0026rsquo;s easy to forget that I didn\u0026rsquo;t accept it at first. It\u0026rsquo;s so much– it\u0026rsquo;s my whole life now, being a clone and being with other clones that it\u0026rsquo;s easy to just sort of file away the idea that I had to find a proof at one point. It feels so undeniable now. I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about it in a while, but I think about it here.\nDORIAN: And my camp scene is, \u0026ldquo;a deeper understanding.\u0026rdquo; Well, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve been explaining what that is, right? Like I am getting a sense of.. it\u0026rsquo;s not what I thought I\u0026rsquo;d find. I was hoping to find, like, more about the people, but I\u0026rsquo;m getting a sense of, like, the life cycle and the ecology of this part of the planet.\nAnd I think… I\u0026rsquo;m getting a little excited because like I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that this is not something that is described anywhere in our archive. Like, elsewhere on this planet, these big snake things, do not live. And so like, I think this might be it. This might be the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m able to bring back to my people as, like, my contribution to our store of knowledge.\nIf I find something about the former residents, that would also be great. But they\u0026rsquo;ve been studied more thoroughly. Not in this settlement, but elsewhere on the planet. And I think this might be like brand, brand new for the people where I\u0026rsquo;m from.\nNICK: So we go back to the mesa, dropping Eugene\u0026rsquo;s energy down to three. And let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nWe find out that the mesa is a non-naturally occurring structure. It is symbolic of a culture beginning to explore art. Eugene takes a second to take a note of this and put it into his scout log, and he moves back west. We drop his energy down to two.\nSATAH: All right, turning my energy to six.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to go on a turned up card in order to get to my next unflipped card, which I could either do the landscape that was, like, the dilapidated structures or the first thing– I think– I found on this planet, which was the animal burrows.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to go down to the animal burrows. And I think the extra detail that I find here… no, they\u0026rsquo;re old– I was going to say that I see the creature that does them. But no, I just– I think what this is is that I just I see more of these– like, this– this weird arm-snake– with– arm-wing-snake is still following me around. And I think that as I\u0026rsquo;m walking I see creatures, like– more odd creatures using these as transitway. Right? Like, clearly this is just something that– the creatures living on this planet, like, go in and out of these shipping containers all of the time using these old holes.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like any of them have the ability to make them. Just confirming, like, they didn\u0026rsquo;t do this. Probably an extinct species did, but they use them to do whatever it is they\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nDORIAN: All right, last leg! We\u0026rsquo;ll see how long it ends up being. You know, this could be another immediate ace or it could take a little longer.\nGonna go all the way up into my corner. And reveal the two of clubs. I think this is my first two… and that is a full circle. Had a half circle, now we have a full circle.\nI think it is time to bring back bugs. But I think… wait, no. I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a bug. But this is the two of clubs. So this is a landscape feature. I remember how this game works.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s still bugs. I think the landscape here… the plateau I\u0026rsquo;ve been traveling through, like the roots of these, um… the roots of these plants are, like, breaking it up a little, so, like, there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit more, like– it\u0026rsquo;s not, like, the big, like, fractured, like, plates, sort of. Like, there\u0026rsquo;s more of a… it\u0026rsquo;s, like, really big gravel. Like, the ground\u0026rsquo;s, like, rockier growing. It\u0026rsquo;s a little tougher to sort of, like, work my way through as I move through this forest of, like, the sappy plants, um.\nBut, like, so, like, the landscape is a lot more, like, gravelly. And there\u0026rsquo;s more, like, different types of… small, like, orb bugs and stuff, like, kind of, like, moving through the earth. So, like, there\u0026rsquo;s more– it\u0026rsquo;s not as stark or as empty as, like, the areas that the snakes have more recently passed through.\nSATAH: Turn my energy down to five. Go over to column three, row four. Four of diamonds.\nFour is a square. Drawn a square with two other squares below it. Could be a cute, weird little robot; could be a box stacked on two smaller boxes… let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nDiamond\u0026rsquo;s a plant.\nI think it is boxes. And I think that this is– I crack open another shipping container and this is a bunch of plant material. It\u0026rsquo;s useless now. It\u0026rsquo;s all, like, expired and degraded and rotted. But clearly this was… probably medicinal plants? Just to keep tying it into like the biomedical theme.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like compost, but also seeds and just stuff that was being gotten rid of. I think– the thing that comes to mind, artificial scarcity, is like, you know how… there are corporations that try to copyright strains of plants by, like, encoding whatever into the DNA? The idea that this was like some sort of technology advanced that made it so that it would be really easy for people to grow this plant that is a very safe painkiller. And so there was a company that bought up all of the seeds of it and just destroyed them. Sent them here. Didn\u0026rsquo;t even use them. Was just like, \u0026ldquo;If people have access to cheap safe painkillers they won\u0026rsquo;t keep buying ours, uh, and so we\u0026rsquo;re not gonna let that happen. We would rather just destroy it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so they sent it here and it has just rotted. This is a bunch of collections of those seeds. Which I do mark because I\u0026rsquo;m like, maybe we could extract dna from it to recreate it or something.\nBut I think that this is evidence of corporate malfeasance where they, um, purposefully caused the extinction of a plant. Maybe that had been like artificially developed. Like, somebody made this plant on purpose and then they just… they were like, \u0026ldquo;Hey! Technically you worked for one of our subsidiaries when you invented that plant and so it belongs to us and so we\u0026rsquo;re going to claim all of it. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to use it, for sure!\u0026rdquo; Shoving it in a blender.\nI love to make worlds that are good. Uh. And nice and fun to live in. Big– fan of that, it\u0026rsquo;s clearly my natural instinct.\nNICK: He\u0026rsquo;s found the ace of clubs. This is our third ace. So we have one more ace before we figure out everything that\u0026rsquo;s happened on this planet.\nThis is a black ace. So this is something that happened in the past. We\u0026rsquo;re going to roll and it\u0026rsquo;s a one. \u0026ldquo;What did the species value?\u0026rdquo;\nThe species absolutely valued expansion and experimentation. I think what led to them being destroyed had to do something with nature biting back. If you don\u0026rsquo;t respect nature, nature will absolutely disrespect you, and you\u0026rsquo;re not winning that fight.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;re going to write down \u0026ldquo;experimentation and expansion.\u0026rdquo;\nOh, and the ace\u0026rsquo;s trait, it was definitely a vestige where we found what gave Eugene the information that he required. There was notes, there was cave paintings, that sort of thing, that he was able to– uncovered pictograms to kind of understand what\u0026rsquo;s happening. He hasn\u0026rsquo;t figured all of the pieces out yet, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to get to that.\nSATAH: And with that, I\u0026rsquo;m going to turn my energy to four and go down to row five in column three. The ten of diamonds. Right, ten is an arrow… drawing a spiral with an arrow at the end. Diamonds are plants.\nOne way to interpret this is, you know, the spiral and the arrow sort of indicating like changing directions… the way that plants turn to follow the sun? I want to see a plant that turns away from the sun here, I think.\nAnd this is probably already– also spliced together, right? That seems to be sort of the theme of what\u0026rsquo;s going on on this planet generally.\nBut yeah, I think quite simply I walk out and I– I was in there for long enough that the sun changed position, is part of it. And I have a moment of alarm because it looks like something\u0026rsquo;s pointing at me, and then I realise, oh, it\u0026rsquo;s these plants. They rotate to have their backs toward the sun for some reason.\nProbably think of like… these are plants that were meant to theoretically grow in less direct sunlight, and they have evolved to be able to be hardy enough to survive here, but the actual flowers can\u0026rsquo;t face the sun. They can photosynthesize it, but the flowers themselves… they have to photosynthesize, like, secondarily, and the flowers have to keep rotating away from the sun so that they don\u0026rsquo;t dry out and burn.\nYou know, plant science! Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it.\nDORIAN: The Jack of Spades. The prompt for the Jack of Spades is that \u0026ldquo;the vestige seems familiar.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd what I\u0026rsquo;m seeing on this Jack is… there\u0026rsquo;s a weird almost like spermy pattern on his coat. I\u0026rsquo;m not rolling with that, um. But he\u0026rsquo;s holding an object that is kind of odd or difficult to parse. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like a fan. It\u0026rsquo;s only got two lobes, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to add a couple more to make it fully like a– like a kind of fan or pinwheel.\nAnd I think what I find is in the middle of this forest, a third watchtower. Um, or a third tower. I\u0026rsquo;ve been calling these watchtowers. But this one has a still sort of intact– I think because it\u0026rsquo;s using the leaves from these– the big broad leaves from these plants I\u0026rsquo;ve been moving through. It\u0026rsquo;s dried them out in some way, and they are still intact as a kind of fan or wheel at the top of this tower, and so I realise that, like…watchtower may have been a component of these, but this one, at least… like, it is a mill of some kind. Like a lot of the mechanism has worn away, but I recognise that kind of wheel because we use something similar where I am from.\nSo I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it was grinding. Like there\u0026rsquo;s no grain or wheat around here, but this is a mill. And like, it was– I can tell, I think from examining it that like, you know, like I think the society that was here, we know, my people know that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a super high tech one. This isn\u0026rsquo;t like a windmill for like a wind turbine for electricity. It was grinding something.\nNICK: We do a camping scene. [Dice rolling] And it\u0026rsquo;s a strange sight.\nSo the sight that we see is… it\u0026rsquo;s another stone circle, actually! But this one\u0026rsquo;s glowing. Eugene doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand why. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to investigate it. Not yet. This can wait until the morning.\nSATAH: And I\u0026rsquo;ll turn my energy down to three. Go over to row five in column two. The King of Spades. Okay, I can draw anything. He\u0026rsquo;s a grumpy looking king! Let\u0026rsquo;s put a smile on that face. Cool. I\u0026rsquo;ve made the king smile and it\u0026rsquo;s not haunting at all. It\u0026rsquo;s really normal, actually.\nThe king of spades is, \u0026ldquo;the vestige contradicts an assumption.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat have I been assuming? Somehow I think this is going to be the thing that makes me realise who the people were, in that they were these constructs. Right? Right, because I was assuming that these were escaped experiments or… just sort of a more standard type of person. And this is a vestige that somehow puts that assumption to rest.\nIs that okay? Should this be an assumption I\u0026rsquo;m making, as a player? Like, should it be about sort of a more narrative level intention? I think it\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nSo what is it? What shows me… the truth of what was happening here, or at least something closer to it?\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying not to get too gory here and I know that I haven\u0026rsquo;t fully succeeded and this will still be too much for some people and I totally get it. Maybe I should have just been leaning in all the way. I always tell my guests to be as self-indulgent as they want but I have a tendency to pull back. Maybe I should have just been leaning in and making this whole episode as gross and visceral as I really wanted it to be, but. That\u0026rsquo;s alright. That\u0026rsquo;s a lesson that I can meditate on and percolate for another time.\nBecause I think what this is, is that this is labeled collections of body parts. This is a whole shipping container that\u0026rsquo;s like left arms, right arms, foot. Just… various bits and organs that have been carefully reclaimed and preserved so that they could be used in the process of creating new people. And obviously they can\u0026rsquo;t– they haven\u0026rsquo;t been– and I think it\u0026rsquo;s not only because the lab exploded, but it\u0026rsquo;s like, there was some fundamental– like, they- they don\u0026rsquo;t have– they weren\u0026rsquo;t getting shipments of brains or hearts or whatever anymore, so this is a bunch of just spare parts. Spare people parts. Spare organic creature… human alien people parts.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re, like, probably mostly vaguely humanoid because it\u0026rsquo;s like we want we\u0026rsquo;re trying to create like a specific type of thing, kinda. And something about the way that it\u0026rsquo;s all carefully organised and labeled– and it\u0026rsquo;s also because I\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing these construct creatures more and more, right? I kind of put two and two together and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Uh, okay! So the people that lived here were built from body parts. Okay. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how I feel about that!\u0026rdquo;\nEggo feels differently than I do. Because I, as a player, Satah, me, a person… obviously I told the story on purpose. I think that\u0026rsquo;s great. Eggo, I think, is like \u0026ldquo;Um. Hmmm.\u0026rdquo;\nBut also does have that, like, moment of connection with it, right? Like, the constructed person– that would- that would hit for a clone. But I think, can\u0026rsquo;t know in this moment– doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the knowledge that I have as a player, which is that they weren\u0026rsquo;t killing people to do this, they were just finding dumped bodies. And stuff and so has a moment of like, \u0026ldquo;Oh! Am I going to be killed to have a Frankenstein\u0026rsquo;s monster made of me? I don\u0026rsquo;t love that. I\u0026rsquo;m going to dip out of here.\u0026rdquo;\nBut yeah, the assumption that was contradicted was these people were regular style. Nope, you were wrong. They weren\u0026rsquo;t regular style. They were amalgamated parts of corpses style.\nCool story. That I\u0026rsquo;ve got going on.\nDORIAN: So I move past the mill to… I only got two cards left, guys.\nThe Ace of Clubs. This is it.\nNICK: And so upon the morning, he gets up one last time. He decides to head west. When he went west, the last thing he found was the ace of spades.\nSATAH: And I\u0026rsquo;m going to go over to the corner. Row one, column five… other way around, column one, row five. It is the ace of hearts.\nDORIAN: Fourth ace.\nSATAH: Our final ace.\nNICK: We\u0026rsquo;re going to roll one more time on the black table.\nDORIAN: Black is the past.\nSATAH: Rolling on the table.\nDORIAN: A four on a black ace is, \u0026ldquo;Who or what was in conflict?\u0026rdquo; So I find a trait that speaks to who or what was in conflict. And I think I know the answer to the question. I just need to figure out what the thing I find is.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started to move on the map toward some stuff I found back before. I\u0026rsquo;m looking at that tablet again. So I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to find is like near this tower, this mill, there\u0026rsquo;s like another building. I think it\u0026rsquo;s another one of these amphitheaters.\nBut this one, like whether it\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s so sheltered or what, like it still has, um– it\u0026rsquo;s more intact. And it\u0026rsquo;s got more of these, like, engravings like we saw on the tablet. And I think it spells out a lot of what I\u0026rsquo;ve already spelled– like figured out in terms of the life cycle of these snakes.\nBut, like, it makes clear– you know, it\u0026rsquo;s, these were… this was happening. when these people lived here, and I think like the movement of these things, like the people kind of followed the movement of these like landscape altering snakes at enough of a distance that like their settlements, you know, were able to take advantage of the growth that kind of followed the snakes. And I think just like… that worked, but at a certain point, you know, like these things, like maybe it takes centuries, but like they move on a cycle. And so like… at a certain point, they began to return to territory that they had cleared, you know, many years before as the ecology evolved.\nAnd so that\u0026rsquo;s the conflict is that, like, the people here were taking advantage of the changes in the landscape brought by this like strange, enormous creature. But they weren\u0026rsquo;t able to deal with the return of those creatures to the land that they were already living on. And that was like kind of the tension.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Where is the species now?\u0026rdquo; Noo! That\u0026rsquo;s a hard question!\nI think, plainly, they all died.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s weird to call it a natural death, because it\u0026rsquo;s… there\u0026rsquo;s very little that is natural about it, but this was a group of people who were created, constructed by some sort of AI with unknown intent. On a broader level, I am thinking, like, this AI, I think mostly meant well but doesn\u0026rsquo;t always understand– doesn\u0026rsquo;t- doesn\u0026rsquo;t totally understand life, right? Was trying to almost maybe- almost make up for what it what it did? That it that it killed a bunch of people and was like, \u0026ldquo;Oh it\u0026rsquo;s okay! I can fix it. I make new ones, see? Yay!\u0026rdquo; but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure because we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re not delving too deeply into the motivations of why the species were created.\nBut. They were created. And I think even after the lab exploded, they had certain– like, they could maintain their bodies to a certain extent, right? They could replace limbs… I doubt that they had a lot of natural healing ability. Very, you know, Death Becomes Her style, where if they got an injury… you get a cut on your hand and it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Well! Probably going to need a new hand soon.\u0026rdquo; And so they would just do those little, like, upgrades and maintenance things.\nBut at a certain point, stuff starts failing that they no longer had the ability to fix. They didn\u0026rsquo;t have new parts coming in. Their lab was exploded.\nBut I think that in as far as you can call it a natural death, I think that they all just lived their lives. These weird constructed second lives that they were given.\nAnd I think I– l– I– I am making it– I\u0026rsquo;m making the narrative call that they were pretty happy. It\u0026rsquo;s a weird life, right? But they- they made clothes. They catalogued things. They investigated. They were people. They did people stuff.\nAnd eventually, they… essentially lost the tools of immortality that they had. If they had sort of a never-ending access to parts then they could, to a certain extent, keep maintaining themselves, though at a certain point it probably does become a Ship of Theseus thing if you\u0026rsquo;re up to, like, replacing your your brain and that kind of thing, right? But that was okay with them, because that was normal to them.\nUm, but it couldn\u0026rsquo;t last forever. And so they lived. They lived lives and they died. And that\u0026rsquo;s okay! [Chuckles] And that\u0026rsquo;s where they are.\nAnd I think what this is… the evidence of this is some sort of memorial that I find. That it becomes clear that– they were dying and they were they were– they were marking the deaths of their community members.\nI imagine that\u0026rsquo;s complicated because I think sometimes probably when someone dies and you have limited resources, you take parts of their body for yours, right? I think that\u0026rsquo;s actually kind of beautiful. That\u0026rsquo;s probably part of their death ritual is that when someone dies, everyone gets an extra finger. Some people– you got 11 fingers now because your friend died and you take part of them onto yourself, into yourself. I think that\u0026rsquo;s really lovely.\nBut they were still marking these deaths. They were still real on some level at a certain point. And I just find memorials for them.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s essentially a green burial site. You know, there\u0026rsquo;s no big gravestones or whatever. There\u0026rsquo;s just– there\u0026rsquo;s one big hunk of metal. It\u0026rsquo;s a shipping container that has been– that gets names etched into it. And then a big part of the land that just– they get buried straight into to naturally decompose\nAnd I wonder if the indication that they all died is that the last name on the memorial wall is not handwritten. The other ones all clearly have, like– they were written by an organic hand of some kind. There are those imperfections. And then the very last name looks like it was typewritten on there, the implication being that the last person who was buried here was buried by one of the androids, not by one of the other people. The organic people.\nYeah. Yeah.\nNICK: And, \u0026ldquo;What was destroyed?\u0026rdquo; I think I know what was destroyed.\nI think what was destroyed was this species\u0026rsquo; attachment to time. Eugene realises that he misnamed the Thanatos spore. What he should have named it was the Chronos Spore. And we will talk about that more in the Unraveling The Story section.\nUNRAVELLING THE STORY SATAH: Alright. So. Found all the aces.\nDORIAN: And that is my fourth ace, so now I go to Unraveling The Story.\nSATAH: So let\u0026rsquo;s go to Unraveling The Story.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Unraveling the Story.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You found all four aces.\nDORIAN \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Four key traits\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;that reveal what happened on this planet.\nDORIAN \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re ready to put the story together.\u0026rdquo;\nNICK: I\u0026rsquo;m ready to put the story together.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Review the aces. What new information has been revealed since they were first uncovered?\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: So first I review the aces.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to grab all my aces to look at them together.\nDORIAN: The first one was that initial reedy watchtower where I thought that it was just, you know, people using the materials around them to build structures that they would find useful.\nSATAH: So first we had, \u0026ldquo;What has been preserved,\u0026rdquo; the fiber processing setup that\u0026rsquo;s been maintained. I do think one thing here is that the fact that clearly the android buried the last of them really cinches it for me that like– clinches? Cinches? [Laughs] It makes me sure that the androids have been maintaining that space. Out of care? Out of mourning? Not sure, not really not clear, but they clearly were actively involved. And so that is one thing.\nDORIAN: The second one was the domed clay dwellings by the river, which I understood to mean that these are pretty individual people and that they, again, it reinforced my impression that they use the materials around them. And I also found an amphitheater there. That was not an ace, but it will become more important.\nSATAH: As for \u0026ldquo;what was destroyed,\u0026rdquo; I still don\u0026rsquo;t know if it was on purpose or by accident. And I think that I\u0026rsquo;m not… I might not answer that? We\u0026rsquo;ll see. We\u0026rsquo;ll see what I need to answer.\nDORIAN: The third one, after a lot of exploring, was the witnessing or the revelation of the fact that those snakes sweeping across the landscape– like, the scale of their impact on the land that they moved past. And then I spent a lot of time pursuing that thread.\nSATAH: Anything new about the medical records? No. \u0026ldquo;Where are they now?\u0026rdquo; No.\nDORIAN: And then the fourth one was this last amphitheater, or as I think I have to call it now more of a gallery. And it shared the insight into how the… what this life cycle looked like and how the life cycle of these large snakes interacted with the migration patterns and the building habits of the people who lived here on this part of the planet.\nNICK: We found what was a once advanced civilisation knocked back into a literal stone age. How that happened, Eugene doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite know exactly, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about that.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Consider other traits you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered during your journeys. Which ones are related to the aces?\u0026rdquo;\nCertainly the dilapidated structures. I think that big wall that I saw probably was. A lot of these things, they certainly, like, interacted with, right? But they didn\u0026rsquo;t create a lot of it.\nThey definitely were the people who set up the zoo signage. I imagine that even if you\u0026rsquo;re functionally immortal, you\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Hey! Stop falling into this big hole… and needing to get new legs. We got limited legs. We can make it work no matter what. You\u0026rsquo;re good. But, like, just be careful.\u0026rdquo;\nNICK: We now have to consider other traits I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered during my journey. I think we found a lot of… predatory creatures, we found some megafauna. \u0026ldquo;Which ones were related to the aces?\u0026rdquo; I think we did just say that. I think there\u0026rsquo;s stone circles. I think that there was pictograms. There was statues of a civilisation that is currently building back to where they once were.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Finally, answer the question, what happened here? Tell the story together at the table.\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: And I\u0026rsquo;ve been answering that. But I think like… you know, the people here found a way to exist in harmony with kind of the world around them to some extent, or to take advantage of the natural rhythms of the stranger– like, the life on this planet. I said stranger life, but like, it was their planet. So like they presumably didn\u0026rsquo;t find most of it that strange.\nUm, but on some cycle, like… maybe something changed. That\u0026rsquo;s my best guess. Like, they had clearly been doing this a long time. They had a rhythm. Maybe something changed. Maybe a snake broke the cycle. Maybe this is a climate change story and the migration pattern of these big beasts changed.\nBut they returned earlier than expected and the cycle was disrupted and people were no longer able to live in the way they had been. And it\u0026rsquo;s unclear what happened after that. Someone else on another Vectorage will have to answer that question. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll be in a part of the planet where the pattern played out differently. Um, or where this pattern didn\u0026rsquo;t happen at all.\nBut the reason that people no longer live on this part of this planet has to do with the change in the rhythm of the natural world and the fact that they discovered their way of life was no longer compatible, because something about that cycle had changed.\nNICK: What happened here was that the species that came here, they were interstellar. They were advanced scientific minds. They had some genius implementations of mutation. But… something went awry. Eugene\u0026rsquo;s memories can kind of put the pieces together from what he discovered in the capsule.\nI believe what happened is that someone stumbled and they knocked the Chronos Spore open. The Chronos Spore… it does- it does eat them. Some people get eaten, but some people react differently. Some people end up getting moved back in time, like quite literally. Yeah.\nI think some people just get isekai\u0026rsquo;d, to be honest. Like, you know? Like, I think that\u0026rsquo;s a fun way of doing it. Yeah, like, some get parasite, and the parasite just kind of, like, just destroys them from the inside out. And it\u0026rsquo;s just other people have some sort of, like, reaction to the parasite, which triggers a response, which opens up a slight rift in time for just them and ports them back.\nAnd the stone circles represent an attempt to get them back to the time period that they belong. So had Eugene entered, he would have figured out the advanced species– he would have found out their portal to get back home.\nSo I think what happened is that a lot of the survivors did get back, right? So the Chronos Spore is a parasite, or is a parasitic entity that will either that will either, uh, eat away at the, um, the host and kill it and part of itself– I think some of it does escape and then infect other things, which kind of results with the animals. Um, but that\u0026rsquo;s only because of what the scientists did to to those spores. Like some of those spores were also genetically modified to to be more invasive and some of that had some unexpected side effects and that- that did cause some megafauna to appear. That caused some of the flora to become megaflora that eats meat. And I think, uh, a lot of that kind of just turned into turned in a whole big shit storm that broke time locally.\nSome of the people escaped and I think Eugene has to go report- uh, report an emergency because, uh, some of the some of the species have evolved into a new species because of the way that they were affected by this parasite and we don\u0026rsquo;t know If that is something that could be contagious. Do they infect people that they touch? Is the food or the liquids that they also touch become infected by the Chronos Spore? Who knows?!\nBut yeah, the chronospore upended this ecosystem. It upended the people that were trying to alter it, too. And the results varied.\nWe have an ancient civilisation that was brought back, an advanced civilisation that got isekai\u0026rsquo;d into the past, came back into the future, left, and is now an intergalactic front. And Eugene has got a lot to unpack here.\nSATAH: I think that I\u0026rsquo;ve laid it out relatively in full. But yeah, there was an elevator. The elevator got an AI assistant put in it, because why not? Why not just shove AI into everything? No opinions on this. But in a sci-fi story where AI actually leads to sentience– sapience.\nThe AI had some sort of break and killed a bunch of people. And then the corporation who owned the building that that elevator AI was in, as part of a cover-up, just tossed the whole thing here.\nAt a certain point, probably a different corporation dumped a bunch of empty android chassis here. They were probably like… like cleaning bots or something, you know? But through some… networking… thing… one of them still had Bluetooth on. The elevator AI was able to hop into one of those bodies, and then a bunch of those bodies.\nAnd began trying to make up for its mistakes. And after all, it was an AI– it- it worked in a hospital. Maybe it wanted to do science and be a doctor. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t allowed. It was just allowed to be an elevator. But now it has the chance.\nAnd so it begins creating life from death.\nAnd these people who are created are confused, but happy. And they start a society. And sometimes new people join because new people get created, but they\u0026rsquo;re just trying to figure life out. You know how it is. No one asks to be created. You just end up where you are, and then you have to live your life. This is true of all of us.\nAnd at a certain point, shipments stopped coming because of this place getting abandoned.\nAnd I think it was an accident, and I think– the lab exploding, I mean. I think it was just creatures chewing wires. This was before there were constructs. These were just the creatures who happened to live on this planet already.\nAnd I think it was scary, but also, like, the shipments had already stopped coming, and so it was like they already weren\u0026rsquo;t creating new people, right? It was hard to lose access to that facility for medical care, but ultimately, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the thing that actually led to their death, their final death.\nAnd then they kept living. Until they didn\u0026rsquo;t. They all died. They\u0026rsquo;re in organic bodies. There are limits.\nAnd after they died, I think… the androids still had that yearning to create life, right? So they– somewhere on this planet, there\u0026rsquo;s another lab that they\u0026rsquo;ve created. At a different scale, a much smaller scale. Probably getting– pulling material from that, you know, animal experimentation wing that I saw, or other ones. And they\u0026rsquo;ve been creating new, different forms of life.\nI think that a lot of the species on this planet did go extinct, because this planet kind of sucks. Like, not super good at sustaining life. And so they brought it back. A little different. A little odd. But in a way that makes them happy.\nAnd that can\u0026rsquo;t last forever either, probably? And we\u0026rsquo;ll see what that means. What it means to have that drive and no longer have the materials to fulfill it. That\u0026rsquo;s not the case yet, so we\u0026rsquo;re all good.\nDORIAN: So my characters are ready to leave the planet. My character.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re ready to leave the planet for the final time. To bring an end to the game, answer the following questions.\u0026rdquo;\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Why does your character never return to the planet?\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s an interesting one because I think they… left to their own devices, I think they\u0026rsquo;d consider it. I think they found this interesting and kind– kind of beautiful in a way, like learning more about this cycle.\nSo I think it becomes a societal norm thing. I think, like, this is a very, like, community oriented people that Gwyn comes from. And I think after your Vectorage, most people don\u0026rsquo;t go off planet anymore. I think these people value discovery for its own sake, and so like once you make a discovery, it\u0026rsquo;s up to other people to build on that. It\u0026rsquo;s selfish, almost, to like continue discovering more and more new things out in the world. Like other people need to be able to witness and experience those things themselves. To build on what you\u0026rsquo;ve created, like what you\u0026rsquo;ve found. Both for their own sake, so that they can have that experience too, but also because different people may bring different insights or lenses to something, whereas if the same person continually re-explores it, they might get stuck in their preconceptions.\nSo I never return to the planet because my people don\u0026rsquo;t do that. We go on our Vectorage and then we return and then we stay.\nSATAH: I think as I\u0026rsquo;m wrapping up, a couple of my crew come. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been marking all of the shipping containers that look like they have relevant stuff in them.\nNow that there\u0026rsquo;s potentially a threat of these androids– who I don\u0026rsquo;t think had bad intentions, by the way, I think they were actually excited. There\u0026rsquo;s no way for- for Eggo to know that. But I think the androids were just excited, like, \u0026ldquo;Ooh, somebody\u0026rsquo;s back! Yay!\u0026rdquo;\nBut yeah, so more of my crew comes and we just pick up some of these shipping containers and get out of Dodge. We\u0026rsquo;ll go through them elsewhere. And I never return because… it seems dangerous, and I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that an android is going to try and kill me to create a new person out of my body.\nThat isn\u0026rsquo;t true. As an author, I am able to state that isn\u0026rsquo;t true, that isn\u0026rsquo;t what would happen. But Eggo doesn\u0026rsquo;t know that.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;What does your character do with their knowledge of the planet, if anything?\u0026rdquo;\nOf course, I first return it to our archive. I share what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned. I discuss with the other people in my community, and we put together what I know with what people have learned on other trips to the planet and refine that further.\nAnd then I think I… I think that work, like, really becomes something I pursue wholeheartedly. Like, I think I work with the other people whose Vectorages were to the same planet and we begin to sort of, you know, map out and try and like understand how it all fits together. You know, like we\u0026rsquo;ve all got these different pieces of a much larger puzzle, so we\u0026rsquo;re continuing to sketch out the boundaries of our understanding. Like, identify areas where, like, future Vectorites on future journeys might be able to contribute, like targeting parts of the planet that, like, we want to propose as options for future Vectorites. Like, I think this is kind of a lifelong project.\nI think for many of my people– not all, like obviously some people like, you know, serve different roles in community. You have to, in order for community, to function. But I think there\u0026rsquo;s some number of people whose like lives upon their return just become about building on that foundation of knowledge. And I think I fall in with like a couple of other people whose Vectorages were to the same place and who want to understand more, and especially want to understand if the people who lived there once still might be there.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What do you do with your knowledge of the planet, if anything?\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t think much, but I– except that I think maybe it inspires me to look into the experiences of other constructed people. I\u0026rsquo;ve been very clone-focused, and this has sort of opened my eyes to, like, different ways that life can be created and what those experiences might mean, and I get curious about that. Slowly but surely. Just broaden my perspective a little.\nDORIAN: \u0026ldquo;Where does your character go next?\u0026rdquo; I think I become part of the,uh– part of the support team for the next person who goes on a Vectorage to the same site. You know? I am one of the people back on the moon watching to extract them if anything goes wrong.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s bittersweet. I really was fascinated by that planet and I would have gone back, um, but that\u0026rsquo;s not how we do things, so, like, all I can do is be… informed about it and be there for the people who do go there to aid in retrieval but like, I\u0026rsquo;m not… I don\u0026rsquo;t go down myself. I have to just sort of watch the planet out the out the window of our sort of base on the moon where we\u0026rsquo;re waiting in case the person needs us and I see… you know, the landmass I went to and I think I… you know, I reflect on it and I… I miss it. I do. I love what I do and I don\u0026rsquo;t– like, I understand and embrace the ways of the community I am part of, but part of me wishes I could go back to that planet.\nAnd I think the last thing we see of Gwyn is, like, them looking out at that planet and maybe looking at the sketches in their old- their old journal and experiencing that, uh, that desire to go back.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Where do you go next?\u0026rdquo; Oh, who knows? More scout missions, right? I\u0026rsquo;m just– we\u0026rsquo;re runnin\u0026rsquo;. We\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re on the run. We\u0026rsquo;re clones. We\u0026rsquo;re… doin\u0026rsquo; crime to sustain ourselves. We\u0026rsquo;re making a life, doing our best, and there\u0026rsquo;s always stuff to find and things– there\u0026rsquo;s always stuff to do. Very next thing probably is drag those shipping containers like onto an abandoned station or moon or something to start going through them and picking out what we actually need so we\u0026rsquo;re not hauling around these huge containers, but. After that? Big universe.\nAnd Eggo isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly in the driver\u0026rsquo;s seat, you know? They care a lot, but they\u0026rsquo;re not exactly the lead conspirator of the clones. So they kind of just– they\u0026rsquo;re doing what they\u0026rsquo;re told and they\u0026rsquo;re looking out for their family. And that\u0026rsquo;s their whole– that\u0026rsquo;s their whole thing. That\u0026rsquo;s all they do. And they love it.\nNICK: That is the game. We have been playing The World We Left Behind.\nSATAH: Alright. Took a picture of my grid, and I used white… again! Dry erase markers. So, methodically dry erasing all of them.\nThere were two cards that I didn\u0026rsquo;t flip. What were they? Five of clubs and the seven of diamonds, which would have been… a rectangle landscape. And the seven of diamonds is curved line plant. That\u0026rsquo;s alright.\nDORIAN: As someone who\u0026rsquo;s not experienced in solo games, it was really interesting to be able to tell this sort of story in a different way from what I\u0026rsquo;ve done with other people. And I thought that this game was a neat way of doing it.\nI can definitely see how, like, the full scale game, which is four completely distinct journeys, albeit with a smaller grid, is, like, a commitment, but I honestly think it would be a really interesting game to play, especially with multiple people who can all contribute their own sort of… material or ideas to the story that you tell, and who over the course of you know like a much larger or longer journey can really like begin to build out some of this stuff a lot more comprehensively.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m definitely curious to try this game as a group experience. I think that it would certainly, uh, add a lot to the interpretive aspects. Interpreting something that someone else drew is is a very different experience than interpreting something that you yourself drew, though I still find it to be useful when it comes to acting as guidance.\nDORIAN: I thought I told a great story and like had some interesting ideas here, but I can really see how over the the full scope of this game, you can build something really like complex and fascinating about, uh, the traces that, um- that people have left behind them when- when something happens.\nNICK: I had a lot of fun playing this. It definitely brought out some, um, some good narrative. Or at least I enjoyed doing it. I hope, uh, you guys enjoyed listening to what I came up with.\nSATAH: It\u0026rsquo;s definitely tough to maintain the pacing of a mystery in this kind of format and I think that it\u0026rsquo;s ambitious and it\u0026rsquo;s cool and I do… I like the story that I told. I\u0026rsquo;m– this is one of those games where I\u0026rsquo;m so excited, particularly, to hear other people\u0026rsquo;s experience with it because it\u0026rsquo;s very– it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s so unclear to me if I… played optimally? Which is not to say in a- in a sort of min-maxed optimised way, but just… I don\u0026rsquo;t know! If there was- if there was– if there\u0026rsquo;s a way to experience this that- that lands a little bit differently.\nI\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m really… I\u0026rsquo;m really glad that I made… this podcast… the way that I\u0026rsquo;ve made it… because it means when I go, hey… I can only experience solo games in the way that I experience them. Genius past me who was like… but what if… that weren\u0026rsquo;t true? I\u0026rsquo;m like, oh, shit! Yeah, nice! Wait, that\u0026rsquo;s the show that I make!\nNICK: And again, I\u0026rsquo;m Nick Butler. I make games about petting puppies and punching bad guys. They\u0026rsquo;re very action-focused. I typically shoot for collaborative narrative mechanics. So if you like doing that world-building stuff with your friends, the games I write tend to offer mechanics that facilitate those sort of things.\nDORIAN: So yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ve been Dorian, and this was– this was a great pleasure.\nSATAH: Wish that this dry erase were coming off the cards a little bit more cleanly, but also I did have to… let them sit for longer than expected, so.

The other two sturdy vessels soaring \u0026lsquo;cross the horizon with me are Caleb Zane Huett \u0026amp; Connor C. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a bit more about them at the break.\nIn Skyworthy, you ARE the ship. As the years pass, you host a series of captains and crews, each one a much smaller chapter in the story of your life than you are in theirs. The game runs off of a standard deck of playing cards, using combinations and comparisons of suits to determine characters and prompts.\nGAME: COMMISSION SATAH: It is garbage collection time. So there are going to be trucks.\nCALEB: [Sea shanty tune] Here we go. This is a test of my microphone.\nSATAH: That\u0026rsquo;s fine. We celebrate these trucks.\nCONNOR: Here we go. Yeah.\nSATAH: Even as podcasters.\nCONNOR: Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the sky recently. I\u0026rsquo;ve been dealing with kind of a bit of a strange sense of vertigo as I look up to it and I just kind of see this endless field of blue… or gray or black, I guess, as the weather or time of day dictates. It feels as though I\u0026rsquo;m standing kind of on the edge of some great expanse, and that if I lose my footing, I\u0026rsquo;ll slip and fall upwards forever into a deep, dark depth. So, naturally, I jumped at the chance to become a skyship. To become Skyworthy.\nSATAH: Today, I\u0026rsquo;m going to play Skyworthy.\nCONNOR: To have the opportunity to be an entity that dares to go up into that vast azure field and return… safely? Maybe. Changed? Oh, absolutely.\nCALEB: I need a standard deck of playing cards with the jokers removed, and so the jokers are once again banished. Those poor jokers. We need a game that\u0026rsquo;s only the jokers removed. Those two are the deck and everything else is pulled out. Or maybe we just need to frame it a little differently every time and say that that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s happening. The jokers are honoured! They remain. Remove every other card and then put those cards through the rigour and the work of having to be used in a game while the jokers celebrate their freedom.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You start simply as a skyship. You are a mid-sized soarwood cutter, capable and adaptable. Be aware you will not end the story as you begin it. Your body will change each time you are refit by a captain to meet their needs.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: So what\u0026rsquo;s really interesting about this one, too, is I play as a skyship? Which is cool. It\u0026rsquo;s so interesting to normally pick and be a person, right? Like somebody who goes out and interacts with the world. And it\u0026rsquo;s going to be interesting to kind of play as the object of interaction.\nBut object feels like the wrong word, right? I think there\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s a vessel, right? Like a ship is a vessel, you know, both literally, but also kind of poetically, right? Like it\u0026rsquo;s a vessel for the people within it.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Your story takes place over four distinct eras, during which time you will pass through the hands of seven different captains.\u0026rdquo; Four different captains in our… our playthrough. \u0026ldquo;And their crews, each growing your legend.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: You are not the blood that pumps in your heart, but, you know, it fuels you, right? And so similarly, you know, while the vessel might not be the people that move about inside of it, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely changed by the people who live in it. And so I think that\u0026rsquo;s interesting. I really like the idea of dealing with, you know… time on a on a very long scale and kind of the memories, uh, and- and kind of the ghosts that we we have living inside of us. Um, and the marks that they leave on us, some some positive and some less so.\nCALEB: I need a journal or a word processor; I have a journal right here to take notes but of course I also have the audio journal of the folio podcast.\nSATAH: So I\u0026rsquo;ll say now… the vibe of this game, in the art– which is gorgeous, very like splatter watercoloury– is very piratical. [Laughs] Uh, wood ships that fly… a little- like pretty fantastical, not as much technological. And I haven\u0026rsquo;t decided yet if I\u0026rsquo;m gonna sci-fi it. I think I could! But it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say if that\u0026rsquo;s… I think that if I do sci-fi it– if I am like a spaceship, kind of, I want to still set certain limitations of probably not… interplanetary? I think there\u0026rsquo;s something interesting about the limitation of it being like on a planet. And that just that image of something that should not fly flying feels to me like it\u0026rsquo;s probably sort of part of the heart of the game? Ooh! Which is the title– that\u0026rsquo;s the chapter that i\u0026rsquo;m looking at right now! I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise that!\nMy inclination is always sci-fi. We\u0026rsquo;ll see. In The Heart of the Game! \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll draw cards from your shuffled deck and note whether you drew a heart, a club, a diamond, a spade, or a combination of these two when called for. This is the beating heart of Skyworthy. Each card suit represents a different descriptor tag to help you choose your prompts. Hearts are dauntless\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Hearts are hardy and enduring, extending my reach or weathering any storm.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Clubs are powerful.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Concerned with projecting force or destroying whatever stands in my way.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Diamonds are sleek.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Impressive, luxurious, or comfortable, making me more apt to catch eyes and imaginations.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Spades are swift.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Making me faster, more agile, or otherwise more difficult to catch and pin down.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: Clubs here are powerful. Diamonds are sleek. Spades are swift and hearts are dauntless. That\u0026rsquo;s, uh, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s good. It resonates. I like that. I can dig it.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;In the event you are seeking permission, you are always allowed to forego the randomness of drawing cards when you see a prompt that calls to you. Simply act as though you had drawn the prompt and continue on as otherwise instructed.\u0026rdquo; Not a thing that will be relevant for me, but it is very good to have that be explicitly stated.\nCONNOR: So let\u0026rsquo;s jump into it! Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the commission. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out why I got made. I am a skyship. And why was I created?\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Your commission. Draw a card.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a card.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Take a moment to answer the below prompt set corresponding to the tag you drew, and tell us about your creation, skyship.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: Amazing. I got… clubs. Powerful.\nCONNOR: So I flipped over the king of clubs, which means I am powerful. I\u0026rsquo;m a government contract. Ooh, okay.\nCALEB: So my commission. Government contract. \u0026ldquo;My engineers had access to the\nCALEB \u0026amp; CONNOR: \u0026ldquo;wealth of a nation,\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;outfitting me to exacting specifications. I was designed to project force and carry the flag to the furthest corners of the world.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Heart, dauntless. Labour of love. \u0026ldquo;Someone considers you their life\u0026rsquo;s masterwork. The attention and care they paid to every join and seam ensures, in this case, love will stand fast in the face of time.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Who was the engineer with the greatest hand in your design?\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;What signatures did they leave in my plans?\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: Ooh, okay. So now we\u0026rsquo;re already getting into it.\nThe engineer with the greatest hand in my design… I think I was made by a child. The government found a child who was kind of a savant who had been obsessed with skyships from a young age and who put together some secrets of their craft very young by experimenting in his own backyard.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know much about this world, but I\u0026rsquo;m imagining that it\u0026rsquo;s sort of a like, you know, a techno fantasy. We are in a industrial age in a fantasy world as they develop things like flying ships.\nSo I think skyships are still relatively new, and up to now, they\u0026rsquo;ve been made basically along one set of designs. And I was one of the first made by the designs of this child engineer, who we will call, um… Colma.\nCONNOR: So I love the idea– I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m always big on the idea of eccentrics, right? People or individuals that kind of go against the grain and are maybe, like, a little bit goofy themselves as well, right? I have a hard time taking things seriously all the time.\nSo when I think about the engineer who has the greatest hand in my design… I think, you know, I like the idea that building skyships is more of an art than a science. So… in that sense, you know, the government, if they, you know– skyships are the way to project force, right? Like they are a way to kind of liberate the force of the government and have that be spread around the world. But I like the idea that in order for them to have this kind of really strength-based approach, they have to go and deal with someone who\u0026rsquo;s a little… anti-that, right? Like not, not quite, uh, they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re more elegance than they are, are force. Um, so I, I, I like the idea that, you know, uh, the- the- they\u0026rsquo;ve gone out and they have recruited someone, um, who- who knows how to make skyships.\nSo the, the engineer, uh, with, with the greatest hand in my design was a shipwright named Galoom.\nCALEB: Colma was my engineer, and she was only 13 at the time that she crafted me. The signatures she left in my plans… I think as a sign of her youth, she always incorporated in the gears, deep within my body that operate the propellers, uh, that move me, along the back– in the gears, there are a few gears that are in a unique shape with rounded– the rounded petals of a flower functioning as the gear. So instead of having stiff sharp edges, she made a few gears hidden in there that are tiny little flowers. Originally painted with a– I don\u0026rsquo;t know you call the middle of the flower– with the middle of the flower painted yellow and then the petals painted with some minor details. So if you\u0026rsquo;re looking through the vast wooden machinery of the skyship, if you were to look close, you would see that many of the key gears are shaped in an unideal but whimsical way, befitting a child\u0026rsquo;s love of the flowers of her hometown.\nSo Colma left those within me. And even if the paint will chip, that shape will stay the same because the gears around them are designed to accommodate them so it would be expensive to replace all that stuff.\nCONNOR: The way that Galoom approaches building ships is a very inside-out approach. Right? They– it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit unorthodox, you know. The government is looking for things like, oh, it needs to have, like, crew quarters for like a hundred crew, or it needs to be able to haul at least 500 tonnes of goods and gold and stuff.\nIs that a reasonable amount for a ship to even carry? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason why I\u0026rsquo;m not a shipwright.\nBut I think when Galoom starts with this contract, he looks at it like we\u0026rsquo;re making the heart of the ship first, right? We build the heart. And so that signature… that they leave. They see the building of the ship as like a very organic process, right? Building the skeleton and, you know, sort of kindling the heart, you know, starting to breathe kind of the fire, the life into that ship.\nAnd so the signatures that they leave in the plans is that the ship itself seems almost organic in nature. While, it is, you know, regimentally structured and stuff, the ship has got like a very natural flow to it. It\u0026rsquo;s very, um… it\u0026rsquo;s sleek, but it\u0026rsquo;s also lumpy. You know? It\u0026rsquo;s slumpy??\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of got like these odd projections and it\u0026rsquo;s, you know– if a ship could have like knobbly knees or like awkward hands, you know, it has… it has a certain honesty to it, right? Like a certain newness, right? Like a just having grown up a little bit and starting to find a confidence in its own existence.\nSo yeah, the signature that I think they left in my plans is that I\u0026rsquo;m organically designed, but awkwardly implemented. So there might even be like some hallways and stuff inside me that just kind of seem to go to nowhere, or even sometimes like they lead out to like a very scenic view, and, you know, the government says, \u0026ldquo;You know, this is not really a functional area of the ship,\u0026rdquo; but the engineer is adamant that it\u0026rsquo;s necessary, right? It needs to have this, because it\u0026rsquo;s a critical structure in order for it to feel alive.\nSATAH: First prompt is, \u0026ldquo;Whose love and labour is owed to your construction? For what grand purpose did they produce such a singular skyship?\u0026rdquo;\nLabour of love… could mean a hobby– this was a hobby? Like the classic sort of the project car that gets worked on over– and maybe is never quite expected to be finished, and then is, over the course of a lifetime or a very long time.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also the idea that the love is, I was a gift, I was constructed for somebody, either as a gift or… to guarantee their safety?\nCould be an artist who was like, \u0026ldquo;How can I make the most beautiful skyship?\u0026rdquo; Like the idea that… skyships are always very utilitarian and this was somebody who was trying to like push the aesthetic bounds of it.\nI think the thing I\u0026rsquo;m most drawn to there is the idea that I was constructed for somebody to keep them safe. And I think it was a little bit of a project thing like I\u0026rsquo;m picturing a gruff– a gruff butch mechanic who was always like– I mean this is too small scale but the vibe of tinkering in the garage, and then one day, very abruptly, going to… I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s like a partner or a sibling… maybe a sibling, yeah.\nAnd she, like, is like– goes to her younger sister or something and is like, \u0026ldquo;Um. So I know that you\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to travel and that I\u0026rsquo;ve always disapproved of it because it isn\u0026rsquo;t safe. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t. [Sighs] But.\u0026rdquo; and like shows her the ship, you know? And is like, \u0026ldquo;I would feel better– if you have to do it. If you have to do it, I\u0026rsquo;ll feel better if you go in this.\u0026rdquo;\nThe question is, \u0026ldquo;What grand purpose?\u0026rdquo; I think that\u0026rsquo;s grand enough, right? This is like, this is somebody who spent a lot of time constructing this ship to her specifications. She thinks that safety- the, like, regulations are a little lax. And so she built something that was not just up to code, but considerably higher than code.\nA skyship is… is big, though. So can it be one person? I guess over a long enough span of time was in the equivalent of a dry dock and this was like years and years and years. And maybe the sibling is much younger and so it was sort of like as- as the younger sibling was growing up, she was like working on this and then gave it to them as a young adult kind of thing. Yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Maybe- maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll see more about that, especially when I figure out who my first captain is.\nI should probably name her… Ginny. Which was, in fact, from me looking at the word \u0026ldquo;engineering.\u0026rdquo;\nGinny Profunda. Ginny Profunda made me for her younger sister.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;What production delays strained the terms of your contract? How did the engineers find a workaround?\u0026rdquo; Ooh, I have a couple of thoughts about this.\nI think one just as like an interesting piece of flavour is that Colma was taken by this government to do this job kind of against the will of her parents. And her home- her parents and the others at her home took it into their own hands to try to get her back. So the process of engineering me was fraught because I was being continually moved to accommodate moving Colma so she was not found and returned home.\nThis is not a great government, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say.\nCONNOR: I think, you know, when it when it comes to building this ship, right, the going to the the more art than science aspect of it, um, I think the idea was that there are– there are some very, like, specific materials that Galoom required for building the ship.\nUm, what could those materials be? I mean there\u0026rsquo;s a part of it that like you know really likes body horror and stuff… so maybe, you know, maybe some parts of the ship were- were grown, right? Um, like the mast and, uh, any like- any protrusions, any like, um, like… you know… what is it? What is it called? Like at the bow of the ship, like the, uh, is it the gunwale? Is it the gunwale?\n[Typing] , it is not the gunwale. Uh, that is just the part where the, uh, like the, the edge of the ship. No, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking, like, the thing that sticks off the front of the ship, right? Oh, gosh, I need to… I should have looked up some ship parts beforehand. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be talking about boats all day.\nBut, yes, like, the prow of the ship was kind of grown organically from, like, a calcium substrate or something, right? And this substrate requires, like, a certain, like, fungus or something to… in order to achieve the desired effect, right? The desired boniness. Um, so that delayed the terms of the contract, was getting this very specific, like, fungus calcium substrate in order to achieve the desired kind of organic look. That really slowed it down. Yeah, absolutely.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;How did the engineers find a workaround?\u0026rdquo; And the production delays also make it sound like there\u0026rsquo;s something to do with what\u0026rsquo;s happening in my… body…\nI think other than those production delays, it was an issue of… Colma\u0026rsquo;s design relied on the use of an extremely expensive mineral. An extra light metal that was able to be flexible and be used in certain pieces of my design amongst the wood that kept it from getting bogged down and weighed down by heavy metal, like, plates and stuff. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s like a power system that requires a thin metal.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s very rare. It was difficult to find. And as a result, the final design is actually compromised a little bit. I am heavier than my original intent, and all of these metal plates that were meant to be something like Mithril, you know, in Lord of the Rings or other fantasy stuff, a very light but very sturdy metal, are instead a more traditional steel– I guess we have steel at this point?– more traditional steel. And that means that I am slower and heavier than Colma\u0026rsquo;s original design.\nBut a lot of the engineers that were working with the designs of this child saw her desire for that mineral to be kind of a childish fancy. It would be like a kid saying, \u0026ldquo;I want my whole house to be made out of diamonds.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: And how did the engineers find a workaround on this?\nSo I think the process is fairly time-consuming, right? Like, it takes a while to grow bones, and so what the engineers did was that they sculpted them. Right? Or– maybe not– sculpted isn\u0026rsquo;t the right word. But they tried to kind of, like, deceive Halloum a little bit.\nOr- not Halloum. Galoom. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of the cheese.\nAnyay, Galoom. They tried to deceive him a little bit by making it out of, like, like ceramic, right? Like they would, you know, the process was taking a long time. I mean, it took a while to source the fungus, and it takes a while to nurture the fungus. So they, you know, when Galoom was asleep, some of the other engineers would get in, and they\u0026rsquo;d be like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, do you remember what this bone is supposed to look like?\u0026rdquo; And, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I think it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to look like a thigh bone or something.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Like a femur?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, yeah, like a femur.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Okay, okay, so we can sculpt something that kind of looks like a femur.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so they would do that. They would build kind of simulated bone and then just kind of leave it in the substrate and Galoom would wake up the next morning, and he would see that the progress far exceeds his expectations. And, well, you know… while I know it was like a little bit of a deception, I think he looked at it as, \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m doing something right. If nature seems to be pushing the process along, then I must be in line with- with nature.\u0026rdquo; Right?\nAnd so these are engineers that were put on the project. These ones are actually working for the government who are trying to, you know, keep- keep Galoom from spending, you know, four weeks trying to craft the perfect door, um. And so they- they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re the ones who try to rein in the artistry a little bit.\nIs that sabotage? I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s sabotage if you\u0026rsquo;re, like, encouraging the plans. You\u0026rsquo;re helping them along. It\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s like a little… it gets, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s dishonest but like, it\u0026rsquo;s- it still encourages the vision, which I think is kind of fun.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;The day of your first launch was a momentous occasion. Who was there to see you take flight for the first time?\u0026rdquo; Hmm.\nThe thing I\u0026rsquo;m immediately imagining is that this, like… Ginny and the sibling, this family live in, like, a small community. And that\u0026rsquo;s part of what made the younger sister, like, want to explore and travel, right? Like, small town, wants to see the world.\nAnd I think that everyone was there because ever– and like, in a way that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand as a child, when people were saying, like, \u0026ldquo;It isn\u0026rsquo;t safe. No, you can\u0026rsquo;t do this thing,\u0026rdquo; she only felt the oppression of it. She only felt, like, oh my god, I\u0026rsquo;m trapped here forever. And later in life she will come to accept that it was care. It was real care. They genuinely weren\u0026rsquo;t safe. The regulations were shit. People were constantly dying.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s even that, um, skyships as a thing were barely real and people were going, like, into the oceans in these regular ships and just constantly get- getting their getting their shit wrecked. Getting- getting shipwrecked. Getting their shit wrecked at a shipwreck. Um.\nAnd it was just- it was just dangerous. And skyships were– like, Ginny didn\u0026rsquo;t, like, invent skyships, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think we had one where we… like, that came out of where the– this small, uh, community was? This village or small town or city or whatever. Um, and she did that so that the younger sibling could leave safely and the whole town wanted this.\nLike, this is really- this is a big deal. This is such a huge source of local pride and the idea that this kid, now young adult, can go off into the world and, like, explore and be the pride of this town without, like, as inevitably falling into tragedy? Which I understand might be tragedy– we don\u0026rsquo;t stay with one captain the whole time, if she even is the captain, um, which I think she\u0026rsquo;s not because it\u0026rsquo;s going to have to be refit. Well, we\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens.\nEveryone was excited. Everyone was really proud and excited.\nAnd I think, you know, I characterised Ginny as- as quite gruff in that moment. Like, the not really knowing how to show she cares type thing, um… which is, uh, me. Which I\u0026rsquo;m pulling on from me. [Laughing] It\u0026rsquo;s something I occasionally struggle with.\nThe idea that the, um, town in part is also– at least, this- this community, you know, is excited to be able to support Ginny by supporting her younger sibling and supporting this launch and this– having this big party that it\u0026rsquo;s like… wow, it\u0026rsquo;s so nice to be able to… [Laughing] we can compliment Ginny\u0026rsquo;s work as a way of expressing that we care about her without scaring her off. [Laughs]\nI\u0026rsquo;m laughing at myself. I\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of work. This isn\u0026rsquo;t as active for me, but it is always going to be part of me.\nSo yeah, the whole town, the whole town showed up.\n[Sing-song] What is Ginny\u0026rsquo;s younger sibling\u0026rsquo;s name? Laura. And yep, that is because I was like, oh, I named Ginny for engineering. What if I named Laura for something that she\u0026rsquo;s going to do? Exploring. Laura. From explor… a. Eh. [Soft meow in the background] I know, Garold, it was a bit of a stretch.\nOh, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be so hard for me not to get super distracted by thinking– because I\u0026rsquo;m like, ooh, wait, if Ginny\u0026rsquo;s like this brilliant constructor or- or- or mechanic or whatever where she can like do all of this work by herself over the course, that there\u0026rsquo;s probably a little bit of like the people in town being like, we tried to get her to leave town too, to like go to the big city and go to school and fully realise her potential, but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t- we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it. She stayed because she thinks it\u0026rsquo;s important to stay here and take care of us. And that\u0026rsquo;s great! And we appreciate it. And she is a valued member of the community. We\u0026rsquo;ve always wondered if she would be happier if she\u0026rsquo;d stretched her legs and gone out into the world. That ship– sorry, pun, kind of– has sailed. But hey! We can help her help her younger sister. Like, that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s almost making up for it on sort of, like, a community level?\nYeah, and I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna get– I\u0026rsquo;m not just gonna sit here and think about these two. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– because I\u0026rsquo;m a ship. I\u0026rsquo;m a ship. I\u0026rsquo;m the ship! So I\u0026rsquo;m– I- I barely know Laura. I\u0026rsquo;ve hunt out with Ginny this whole time while- while she, like… I think probably, like, retrofits me and you know gives me sail– gives me- gives me flying capabilities etc.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;What name were you given when the contract was completed?\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: Well the government- government names things so boringly, right? Like, it\u0026rsquo;s always after like some famous person or a significant political figure, right? Like that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s where it comes from, you know. Like, oh, it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s the SS Elizabeth or Queen Anne, right. Like it\u0026rsquo;s, uh, it\u0026rsquo;s named after people.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think Galoom got to name it. He tries to. The name that\u0026rsquo;s coming to me right now is Jasper. I feel like Galoom wants to name the ship Jasper, but the government\u0026rsquo;s not having it. They\u0026rsquo;re intended to project force. Jasper doesn\u0026rsquo;t really sound like a… it\u0026rsquo;s an honest name, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a threatening name. Or at least, rather, I don\u0026rsquo;t know any threatening Jaspers.\nSo, what was the name? Projecting force… well, where I\u0026rsquo;m thinking now is like, okay, force, you know, like a Newton, like a unit of force. Force over distance is work, is effort, is energy. So, maybe The Joule? But not like… you know, maybe- maybe I won\u0026rsquo;t call it like The Joule, like J O U L E, but maybe- maybe there is still like a– maybe somebody in government still has like a– can still have a little bit funny with- fun with it. Right? So…\nUgh. How boring do I want to– I feel like the Azure Joule… um, or The- The Joule Azure? Hmm. Gosh, naming things is hard.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What name was given to you at your christening?\u0026rdquo; Ooh! Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s hard.\nCONNOR: Okay, we\u0026rsquo;re going to get one more layer removed. So force to joule to jewelry…\nSATAH: Right, if you search ship names, it\u0026rsquo;s going to tell you about putting two people\u0026rsquo;s names together. [Laughs]\nCONNOR: The King Sapphire. Yeah.\nAnd then we establish that we\u0026rsquo;re kind of in a bit of a… a monarchy situation, right? But the- the King Sapphire. Right? It\u0026rsquo;s his- his blue jewel of the skies. Um, and it, you know, it burns with an internal fire, kind of like a- like a sapphire does too, right? Like, that comes back to the- the heart of the ship, right, um that- that Galoom had- had created.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s look at \u0026ldquo;boatingwise.com: 900+ great boat names.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: So yeah, I think definitely, like, the King Sapphire.\nAnd then I think this kind of tells me a little bit more about the ship as well. I think it\u0026rsquo;s like a brilliant blue vessel. And that\u0026rsquo;s kind of like a bit of a… it\u0026rsquo;s almost like a stealth ship then, right? Because blue skies, blue vessel.\nSATAH: No… words related to safety…\nCONNOR: Yeah, I like that. Okay.\nYeah, so it\u0026rsquo;s… I am the King Sapphire. I am the jewel of the Empire. And I am the first stealth ship to be created.\nAnd I think that kind of goes with a bit of that organic construction as well, right? It\u0026rsquo;s almost like a camouflage to build something that resembles nature. A concrete building stands out very starkly on a grassy field, right? So how do you make a big building blend into a grassy field? Well, you make a… you make a grassy building, I think.\nMaybe it looks a little bit like a bird, too, with, like, big awkward wings. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I said, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s got, like, kind of knobbly hands and strange joints. So maybe it has, like, large, kind of gawky, bluish, translucent wings that catch the sunlight and glimmer from on top, but when you look at it from below, it looks like a mere ripple in the sky.\nCALEB: I was given the name… I\u0026rsquo;m thinking through things. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about the flower. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about this strange metal. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about Colma, the child.\nSATAH: How can I- how can I- how can I… a name that something is, like… can I get safety and exploration into the same concept?\nThe first thing I thought of was a net. A net enables you to, like, you know, go high– I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of, like, high rise, uh, acrobats and stuff. You can go higher and be more daring if you know there\u0026rsquo;s a net to catch you.\nMmm… The Catching Net, I think.\nAnd I like– I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna- I\u0026rsquo;m not- I\u0026rsquo;m NOT getting distracted. I\u0026rsquo;m so focused. But I do like the idea that it is also a segment of like a lyric from a song, maybe that Ginny and Laura knew, like, from their childhood? Maybe even a song that, like, their mother wrote or something, and she was a musician… maybe not. But just, yeah. It\u0026rsquo;s- it is, to people from here, at least, recognisable as a segment of a lyric. For Ginny, specifically it means like you\u0026rsquo;ll land safely if you fall.\nAnd then I think it also gives it this interesting, like, reputation– like, people hear The Catching Net and they think like this is going to be… not even like a fishing– like, bounty hunting. Like this, oh, this is a ship that will track you down. You know, it can very easily be turned into a threat. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s very cool to have all of those meetings in there. So yeah, The Catching Net is the name.\nCALEB: My name is Greenblade. Greenblade meant to… evoke the freshness of a plant, the newness of the design, and blade meant to evoke the speed and sharpness of the skyship moving through the air and cutting through the clouds.\nBut of course, the real reason it\u0026rsquo;s called Greenblade is because of a mythological story Colma\u0026rsquo;s parents used to tell her of a hero who wielded a green blade, a sword made entirely out of plant. A fairy who plucked it directly from a tree, and from that point forward, it was sharper than any other sword.\nSo we were always Greenblade. And Colma gave us that name before we were even born, as she wished to find her home again.\nCONNOR: Cool. All right. Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with this as my commission.\nCALEB: I believe I have completed my commission.\nSATAH: I think that\u0026rsquo;s it for the commission, so we\u0026rsquo;ll go into the first era!\nBREAK SATAH: It\u0026rsquo;s beautifully fitting that the first ever return guest is one of the first ever guests of the show at all. Thank you so much to Caleb Zane Huett for coming back on the show. Caleb, of course, is one of the brains behind Triangle Agency, a paranormal investigation \u0026amp; corporate horror roleplaying game that you can pick up at shop.hauntedtable.games or hauntedtable.itch.io. He\u0026rsquo;s also a genuine, kind, and hilarious person who I am honoured to get to idly chat with about games and stories. Follow hauntedtable on Bluesky and pick up the LITERALLY award-winning Triangle Agency as soon as you get the chance. Also, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard it, go back and listen to the first ever Folio series, in which Caleb and Tomas Gimenez Rioja play Accomplice. It kicked off the show. It was the thing that gave me the confidence to be like, \u0026ldquo;I think this is working! I think this will work. I think this can be a show,\u0026rdquo; and that is in huge part tow– because– [stumbling] of him. Not because of me. \u0026lsquo;Cause listen to how I talk. What was that?! No, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do it again! I have to move on!\nConnor C is a dear old friend of mine and a brilliant storyteller. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have the relationship to games that I do now if not for the time I spent at his table, like, ten years ago. He gave me a completely skewed vision of what Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition actually feels like to play with his collaborative, clever, deeply strange DMing. He was graciously enthused every time I sent him 3000 word Google docs at 4 am about how my character\u0026rsquo;s grandparents met. He always encouraged my creativity and depth of play, and I am thrilled to have him here. Even if it does mean that both guests have a name that starts with C, which made me literally scream into my mouth a few times while doing the episode transcriptions.\nSpeaking of screaming into my mouth, you are currently listening to my show– thank you! My name\u0026rsquo;s Satah. I\u0026rsquo;m a TTRPG editor and designer, podcast wrangler, and musician. My singer-songwriter acoustic goth broadway bedroom doom pop feelings project people you meet outside of bars released an EP at the end of last year and a full length-album at the end of February for record production month. Check out my work at gaygothvibes.online and follow me on Bluesky at posatahchips.gaygothvibes.online.\nAnd now… with our commissions completed, it\u0026rsquo;s time to meet our first captains.\nGAME: FIRST ERA CAPTAIN CONNOR: Get ready for the first era, my first flight. Okay.\nCALEB: I have to draw two cards to determine my first captain.\nCONNOR: If I draw two of the same suit, continue to draw until I have two different suits. Okay.\nSATAH: I really do want this first captain to be Laura. But we\u0026rsquo;re going to see what I draw.\nCALEB: My first two cards are hearts and clubs, so I need to scroll through to find what the captains are…\nCONNOR: Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s take- let\u0026rsquo;s take a look. Let\u0026rsquo;s flip over the first card. It\u0026rsquo;s a spade… and a diamond. Ooh, okay, what does that mean? Sleek and swift.\nSATAH: I drew a heart and a diamond which is dauntless and sleek.\nCALEB: Hearts and clubs– oh, it\u0026rsquo;s the first one! Dauntless and powerful. The Decorated Admiral.\nSATAH: The Shrewd Merchant.\nCONNOR: The Dilettante Noble. Oh, this is- this is fun. This is fun. I like that the, um– they\u0026rsquo;ve gone and given this stealth ship… [Laughing] to a noble? Oh no, what happened here?\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;This is not the Admiral\u0026rsquo;s first command, and it shows. They are experienced, wise, and protective of you and their crew.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You and the merchant pursue profit to the edges of the horizon. They are hungry, resourceful, and stubborn to a fault.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;I am a status symbol. And the noble intends to show me off. They are vainglorious, bored, and grasping.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Is this Laura? Or did the ship end up in someone else\u0026rsquo;s hands? This is, like, the first flight… let\u0026rsquo;s- so, let\u0026rsquo;s do the second step and see.\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;The jewel in their collection of treasures…\u0026rdquo; oh, wow. Hey, the jewel in their collection of treasures? How?! Oh, this is fun. This is really fun.\nOkay, yeah! Oh, man, already. You know, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking, like, okay, the ship was commissioned by the king, right? And then they look to their… their son, right? Like their heir. And they\u0026rsquo;re like, okay, yeah, I really, I want to, you know… it is,\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s their 18th birthday, right? And so it is only fitting that they are granted their own commission, their own ship. And so this is a 18th birthday gift for the king\u0026rsquo;s son, hoping that it would be a motivating force for them to become a little bit more mature. Right? Um, and so yeah, he named it the, uh- the– oh, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not the- oh, because, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be- he\u0026rsquo;s gonna be the prince… no, no no; I think it\u0026rsquo;s the King\u0026rsquo;s Jewel and he\u0026rsquo;s giving it to the prince in hope that it will bring him to kingliness.\n[Typing] \u0026ldquo;A prince who likes to party.\u0026rdquo; This is silly! I love this already, yeah.\nFIRST REFIT SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Draw a card for a chance of refit.\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;If the suit on the card you draw matches either one of your captain\u0026rsquo;s suits, you gain the corresponding refit.\u0026rdquo; So let me see. I draw. And yes, I get another clubs! Because I got the clubs, I got \u0026ldquo;the long nines.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does it do? What does it look like? And how did your captain acquire it?\u0026rdquo;\n[Dramatic voice] \u0026ldquo;The long nines…\u0026rdquo; [Regular voice] I appreciate that this prompt is just like, we\u0026rsquo;re going to put some words here and you are going to decide what that means.\nI think the long nines are, obviously, sniper rifles. They are really, really interestingly gilded and huge sniper rifles on the scale of a ship. There are two of them, both pointed forward on the ship. There are two sniper rifles pointed, uh… at the… prow? Is that the front? We\u0026rsquo;re revealing that I have failed to do what all authors are required to do, and it\u0026rsquo;s learn how a boat works. At the prow, I think.\nI think the trade-off of the long nines is that they are a long charge-up time. So, part of what the people who fire them get good at doing is timing them several seconds in advance, as they need to be heated up and charged and then fired. And then also, I think they are not as powerful as a cannonball, so they must be precise.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a tough combination. You have to be making precise shots, a la a sniper rifle, but you have to be making them several seconds in advance and preparing the gun to fire after… let\u0026rsquo;s just say three seconds. Even three seconds is a long time when you\u0026rsquo;re talking about a sniper rifle. To fire at the end of a three second charge up that you cannot stop once you\u0026rsquo;ve started it. I think that\u0026rsquo;s interesting.\nAnd those are the long nines. I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to make a note about that so I don\u0026rsquo;t forget.\nCONNOR: I drew a club, so I don\u0026rsquo;t get any refits.\nSATAH: I drew a heart, so I am going to get a refit. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what it is. The dauntless refit for the shrewd merchant is a \u0026ldquo;cavernous hold.\u0026rdquo;\nHungry, resourceful, and stubborn to a fault… I mean, that does sound like it could be Laura. Maybe what this is is… she goes to explore and she finds herself in, like, a shipping hub and loves the chaos. Like, is lost, for sure, but in a delighted way, and is, like, trying to follow the flow of the crowd. And, like, people are yelling at each other and- and- and- uh, haggling and bargaining in– just right in this dock where she first lands. And she just, like, feels this spark. And that\u0026rsquo;s how she sort of gets into trading, specifically.\nAnd I think she also, like– she looks– she\u0026rsquo;s looking around and she\u0026rsquo;s looking at all these ships that have fifteen different types of boxes on them, that are stamped with the cargo from from a hundred different places. That these ships are obviously like going all around the world and having an excuse to. And she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh. Oh. This could be the thing that gives me guidance on where I go.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so she does add a re– she does do a refit. Uh, she adds the, uh, the cavernous hold.\nAnd I think what this is is, um, there was a– there was a- a room on the ship that was very, like– a parlor, essentially? She\u0026rsquo;s not– she\u0026rsquo;s not ripping out, like, all of the places where people can live and be comfortable. But there was a room that, like, was made to- to- to host and be a little fancy. And she just guts it. That- these- are the– this is the first thing that she sells is these probably hand carved locally sourced furniture from her hometown. She- she rips it all out and- and the- the fabric, the coverings…\nAnd- and I want to be clear, I- I- I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to seem like she\u0026rsquo;s doing this disrespectfully. I don\u0026rsquo;t– she\u0026rsquo;s not like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, fuck all this.\u0026rdquo; She\u0026rsquo;s, like, appreciating the craftsmanship. And, like, I find it a little distasteful to only start noticing the positive aspects of something when you realise, like, oh, I need to find a way to sell this. I find that a little distasteful, for sure. But I do think Laura grew up around this. Like, this is just something that is done in her hometown. And she never had occasion to recognise that it\u0026rsquo;s special. And in this moment, she does. And she does that so that she can sell it. So that she can do a good job at selling it.\nAnd she does. She sells all the furniture in this room and she buys some shelving and some straps, and she turns this big parlor into a cavernous hold for goods.\nCONNOR: Okay, yeah, so what was this captain\u0026rsquo;s name? I mean, obviously it starts with Prince. Cool, we\u0026rsquo;re halfway there. This is going to be like a royal name, right?\nSo we\u0026rsquo;re in a world where the sky isn\u0026rsquo;t the limit, right? But the sky is like kind of that… final frontier, um. And so I feel like names of some kind of gravitas would have something to do with the sky. So it\u0026rsquo;s like– what\u0026rsquo;s a really– a powerful thing that the sky does, is- is, you know, thunder and lightning. It\u0026rsquo;s like– is Thunderhammer too on the nose? Like Prince Thunderhammer?\nI think thunder is a good place to start, because I feel like this prince is- is loud, right? Is- is very boisterous and, um, he\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a narcissist, right? And really loves the sound of his own voice. And he has a very big and booming voice, right? So, you know what? Let\u0026rsquo;s just get really sky -y with it, you know? Thundercloud. Yeah, Prince Thundercloud.\nSo, yeah, so Prince Thundercloud, so-called, you know, a very apt name, the Thundercloud family, for they are known for their booming voices and… their stormy temperament. Yes, how\u0026rsquo;s that for subtext, right? So when things are going well, they are loud, they are boisterous, they are the center of the party. They can be the life of the party, absolutely. But when they get glum, when they get… you know dour, right, that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s when they really darken the skies, right, and that- that is where the Thundercloud comes in. So yeah. Yeah, Prince Thundercloud. Oh, I love this. This is great. This is great. Wow– this is randomly generated? What? What?! It\u0026rsquo;s wack! It\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nCAPTAIN\u0026rsquo;S PROMPTS SATAH: Okay, now answer the captain\u0026rsquo;s prompts.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Describe the daily routine of the Admiral and the sailors under their command. How do they deal with the boredom and drudgery of endless patrols in this era of relative peace and prosperity?\u0026rdquo; Oh, interesting.\nOkay, so we established in the previous section under my commission, that while this ship was developed by a government, the government was willing to take a child from her home against their will in order to get these built. And that it was a design intended to be competitive versus other designs. So I think what we learn about this era of relative peace and prosperity is that the ships they\u0026rsquo;re competing with are also within the empire. They\u0026rsquo;re not in a war; they are dealing with a community of people who have been building their own ships. And something Colma uncovered would have meant that the citizens of this empire would have had better equipment than those who are intended to police it. So this admiral is now given the Greenblade, the first of these ships, and is set with patrolling her own country, her own empire.\nThe daily routine… I think they\u0026rsquo;re primarily concerned with two things. One is trade. They are assisting with the movement of important resources from place to place in this empire, which I believe is very large and crosses multiple islands and land masses, which requires the use of skyships sometimes for transportation and trade. So the admiral assists, both as a ship that can carry that stuff and as a bodyguard for larger, slower skyships who are attempting to carry important cargo.\nAnd then the other thing they do is a different kind of important cargo, which is people. I think they are often acting as basically a private jet for the most important people in this empire, the emperor and his entourage. So I think, I think… I think that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nAnd the way that they deal with the boredom of this– because it is kind of boring– you are dealing with some of the most, like, specialised and annoying– potentially– people in the country and you are moving stuff back and forth in kind of a boring way. You\u0026rsquo;re not getting a lot of combat, even though you\u0026rsquo;ve been trained for it. I think they handle it by playing a lot of games on board. And I think a few of the sailors are smugglers on top of this. They have their own secret cargo they\u0026rsquo;re moving around.\nAnd so the Admiral, who is decorated and proud of the work she\u0026rsquo;s done, also knows that she has, by virtue of the team she\u0026rsquo;s put together, built something of a crew of spies and criminals who are doing their jobs very well, but who are not chastised or stopped from acting on their own behalf during this time. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing because the Admiral herself is also doing this.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What rare commodity does the merchant load your hold with before setting off for the horizon?\u0026rdquo; I think I kind of just established that. It\u0026rsquo;s, um, like…\nSo this- this- this trading port that she went to was very close. I think that she was with a very, like a very minimal crew and she was told to come here to hire a crew, which she does. And the first thing they do is return to her hometown, first to drop off any members of the hometown crew who don\u0026rsquo;t want to go on the rest of the journey… I think a couple of them do stay though. They\u0026rsquo;re very taken by this energy as well. Maybe all of them stay. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of fun, right? Yeah, they were supposed to– at least for a leg, at least for… a couple journeys, all of them are like, \u0026ldquo;You know what, I want to see this through for a little while longer.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd… just a bunch of the, like, beautiful handcrafted… I\u0026rsquo;m seeing a lot of, like, just carefully woven textiles and handcrafted furniture from… is it wood? It\u0026rsquo;s… yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s, like, a very specific… it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a local tree or something that just– it has this, like, almost deep purple to it, this- this wood.\nAnd Laura just talks to a bunch of the people who make stuff here and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Whatever you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable sending with me, I will sell for you and I will- I will return with profit,\u0026rdquo; or something like that, you know? I imagine, like they have to– there has to be some form of trade, presumably, especially if they\u0026rsquo;re close enough to a big trading port– the- the one that Laura went to first. But she\u0026rsquo;s basically saying like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I can- I can make it faster and I can haggle for you.\u0026rdquo; Ooh, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s one of the things, is that, like, traders come through and will, like, trade goods and whatever, but people in this town didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of like bargaining power or whatever and Laura is basically saying like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, we can do this. I can do this. We can be in control of this.\u0026rdquo; Yeah. Yeah!\nOne other detail is just– I think I mentioned, like, textiles and I think that I really like the idea that this- this- this tree that has this sort of deep purple wood, also it… it\u0026rsquo;s almost like a willow tree in the odd like fibrous leaves that it grows. And that\u0026rsquo;s one of the things also, like, that gets broken down and woven into these textiles. And then a lot of just like… hand dyes with strange, like, gems and rocks that are all around this town. Yeah. Just very, very unique to the, like, physical geography of this place. That\u0026rsquo;s sort of what all their materials are. And that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s a rare commodity to load the hold with.\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Describe the lavish parties that the noble has hosted aboard me.\u0026rdquo; Um, hm. I\u0026rsquo;m putting a bullet point in my notes here that says parties, question mark? Yes!\nInitially, I\u0026rsquo;m like, what kind of parties does somebody host on a sky boat? And immediately the answer was the same kind of party somebody hosts on a water boat, I think.\nUm, and I think– yeah, I think with the– ooh, yeah, because the wings of the ship I described as really capturing the sun\u0026rsquo;s fire, right? And making the wings of the ship glimmer almost. But what I think the prince has discovered is that while the sun\u0026rsquo;s fire is a very fierce and hot and raging kind of energy and lighting… the moonlight, now that\u0026rsquo;s where the party really happens. And the wings glimmer silver and- and… cold. Um, almost like, uh– like being on the inside of a disco ball. Like a disco ball– yeah. Like- like an inverted disco ball, you know? Sitting on- sitting on the inside, uh, of an orb of mirrors as the moon\u0026rsquo;s light glints and glimmers. And I- I think, you know, the prince really loves chasing- chasing the moon and going to different places to see the moon in different phases, um, and- and just really, really drawn in by the most extreme parties.\nThe most, you know– when all the stops have been pulled out are the eclipse parties. Like a full moon eclipse party, yes. And I think this is, you know… I think the prince initially, like consciously, he seeks this party out, this full moon eclipse party as, like, a very unique spectacle, right? He thinks like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, look at me. Look at how fancy I am. I\u0026rsquo;m– Prince Thundercloud goes chasing after eclipses and is able to find them and hosts parties underneath their waxing and waning light.\u0026rdquo;\nBut I think there\u0026rsquo;s a subconscious piece going on here for the prince as well. Something that, it almost feels like a… like a ray– [Laughing] raging against the night, you know? The idea that you can go partying into the dark. And when you are in this darkness, when the very last sliver of light has faded away, that is when the light of the ship, of the prince\u0026rsquo;s own youth and fire, burns the brightest. I have burned so… hot and so bright that it is by my light that the moon once more reveals its face.\nAnd I think this is a, you know, maybe a youth is wasted on the young kind of deal here. You know, the prince is only, what, 18, right? I mean, I guess it was given to him on his 18th birthday. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s been a couple of years and maybe he\u0026rsquo;s like, you know, 20. now or something. He\u0026rsquo;s having like, oh no, I\u0026rsquo;m 22. I\u0026rsquo;m so old, right? My youth is over. Now I\u0026rsquo;m an old guy.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve written, \u0026ldquo;In the darkest part of the eclipse, this is when his \u0026lsquo;waning\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; – and I\u0026rsquo;ve put big sarcastic quotes around waning– \u0026ldquo;youth burns the brightest.\u0026rdquo;\nMan, I\u0026rsquo;ve gone and created a character that I find a little insufferable. But hey, that\u0026rsquo;s the fun of it, right? You don\u0026rsquo;t need to love everyone that you– you think of. You just need to, you know, do right by them.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Tell the story of the day the merchant nearly had to sell you to cover an unexpected loss.\u0026rdquo; Oof.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a while in. She\u0026rsquo;s been going around… is it for a couple of years? I think it\u0026rsquo;s at least a year. Enough time for her to gain a lot of confidence and start taking bigger risks.\nI… don\u0026rsquo;t understand how economies work. I mean, I- I- I do, but I\u0026rsquo;m- I- uh, hate it. And so I refuse to. Which makes it hard for me to think of taking a big risk… [Laughs] when you don\u0026rsquo;t have the money to back it up. What is it?\nOoh, it\u0026rsquo;s crew. Not that they died, but it\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s the crew from the hometown. Um, all of- all of the people who stayed on as the vibe has gotten a little more intense. Higher risk gambling. It seems like the trading is no longer an excuse to explore, but instead, like, we\u0026rsquo;re now often going to places that we\u0026rsquo;ve already been because they\u0026rsquo;re reliable and we know that we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to sell there rather than taking the risk.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the thing, right? We\u0026rsquo;re taking, like– the risks we\u0026rsquo;re taking are not as interesting. They are financial. We are not risking, like, going to a new port so that we can check it out and see what\u0026rsquo;s there. We\u0026rsquo;re just risking, like, buying bigger shipments and having to sell and move more product and that kind of thing.\nAnd we go back to the hometown and all of the members of the crew who are from the hometown– maybe one stays, but other than that, all of them come to Laura and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, we can\u0026rsquo;t do this anymore. It isn\u0026rsquo;t satisfying. It isn\u0026rsquo;t fulfilling. It\u0026rsquo;s just fast and kind of scary. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to stay.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Laura\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, yeah, okay. No, I totally get that. Uh, sure.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she goes to try and hire crew to replace them. And, like, they were the skeleton crew that was sent so they have, like– like- like, when it was just them on that very first journey, that launch day journey– which implies to me that they have some of the most important skills. Like, if you\u0026rsquo;re only going to send five people to do 15 people\u0026rsquo;s work, you really want one of those people to fuckin\u0026rsquo; know how an engine works.\nAnd so, like… Laura quickly learns that hiring their replacements is going to be inordinately expensive. And is getting to a place where she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Okay. Well, I could sell this ship. I could sell The Catching Net and just get a cheaper ship. And then I\u0026rsquo;d have to hire less crew. I can keep the crew I have, hire just a couple people, and be able to use the money that\u0026rsquo;s left over to hire them.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd how is it that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to? I want an answer that isn\u0026rsquo;t, you know, she stumbles upon a bunch of people who are like, \u0026ldquo;I would love to work for experience.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs]\nI think… part of it is some crew members come to her shyly and say, like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been– we\u0026rsquo;ve all been learning while we\u0026rsquo;ve been here. We can cover a bunch of those roles. Probably not quite as well, but we can do it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think one of the things here is that, like, this is Laura going to the whole crew and laying out what\u0026rsquo;s happening. And maybe, just to tie it to why– to the– to why I was created the way that I was, they are like… a lot of them have horror stories of working on other ships where the conditions are technically legal, but fucking miserable.\nI, Satah, worked on a cruise ship for a season, a very small one, and the boat was built, like, in the 70s or 80s. Regulations were different then. But if a boat is old, then you can kind of get grandfathered into the new regulations? Like in the 80s, you were allowed to build a ship where the crew sleep below the waterline. At a certain point, they realised that the crew should not be the first people to die if someone goes wrong, and so legally, you cannot do that anymore. But if you already made the boat, it\u0026rsquo;s okay! As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t do any major renovations to it. Because if you do any major renovations to it, you have to get the whole thing up to code. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that you can sort of… think through the implications of that all on your own. What that means. To have a boat that cannot have any major fixes applied to it because it would have to suddenly leap forward, you know, 30, 40 years in standards.\nAnd I think that that\u0026rsquo;s a thing here, too. Um, except the regulations are even more lax and it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to get– even- even– like, technically there are a lot of ships that, like, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even meet code, but it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to get an exception, unfortunately, from whatever licensing board there is because… they want these ships to be moving and moving products and facilitating trade and that kind of thing. That\u0026rsquo;s more important than making sure that the people on them are safe and cared for.\nAnd so the crew is like, \u0026ldquo;No, we have to keep this ship. We\u0026rsquo;ve all been learning. You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to give us raises, but we can do the crucial work. And we will be cheaper for now.\u0026rdquo;\nWe draw up some contracts that are like, I will take… like, my wage should 300% of what I\u0026rsquo;m making right now. For the next six months, I will accept 200% of what I\u0026rsquo;m making right now. And then… I will be owed the 300– 200% plus retroactive, blah, blah, blah. But sort of just like giving a buffer, giving us time to, like, get more profit. And I can use the savings from not paying them their worth… oh, god, this is a difficult character for me. To… [Laughs] hire crew to replace them in sort of the, like, lower skill stuff.\nOh, god. This is not even close to the most villainous character I\u0026rsquo;ve played, but is the most difficult for me to handle with a straight face.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Tell the story of an engagement in which you and your crew were the only survivors in your fleet.\u0026rdquo; Oh, gosh. Wow. Um… the only survivors.\nI think there was a first spark of a civil war within this empire. It came from a community that happened to have access to many skyships because of their location. Actually, I think because of that they\u0026rsquo;re near a forest. It\u0026rsquo;s a community of foresters who, kind of pushed by the small rebellious activity that started when Colma\u0026rsquo;s family began terrorising the sky harbors to find Colma, grew very quickly into something like a militia that was interested in liberating the main source of wood for skyships from the control of this empire.\nHowever, I think the Admiral has been very happy with her position in the empire and so has the crew, so she was not in a place to try to stop it. And when a bunch of the sky ships from the imperial navy sky navy were sent to attack this place, the Admiral and I, The Green Blade, were the only survivors because we were the only ship fast enough to outmaneuver all the rest of them.\nWe were still the first Green Blade made. All the rest of them were very similar make and model and their cumbersome, slow movements meant that the battle went the way a lot of skyship battles go, which is that everybody goes down. When you\u0026rsquo;re shooting cannons at flying ships, it only really takes one or two shots to knock people down, and those cannons can fire at the exact same time, assuming that both parties are aimed at the other.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re going to say that\u0026rsquo;s another reason why we survived is… I have two guns. Those guns can be maneuvered by specialised shooters at very long distances. And we are able to stay sort of out of the fray and fire these larger sniper rifles, rather than cannonballs directly at important parts of the ship. So I think we are the only ones who are able to maneuver fast enough and make fast enough decisions to not get taken down. And it was a truly… nasty and bloody battle.\nBecause we were the last ones standing and because it was shut down, the civil war\u0026rsquo;s first attempts, the little bubbles of the civil war, did not succeed, at least not now. Rebellion was squashed and the Admiral and her crew– though the tone on the ship really turned sour, I think– became extremely well known and were able to even further promote themselves and their own wealth as a result.\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;When did Prince Thundercloud put me, the King\u0026rsquo;s Sapphire, in the most danger in their pursuit of novelty and excitement?\u0026rdquo;\nI think it was during one of these eclipse parties. I think by their nature, they are already a dangerous event. But Prince Thundercloud really wanted to claim his namesake here, I think. I think… yes. Yes, he managed to find the perfect combination of lunar eclipse and raging thunderstorm.\nAnd I think the idea is that, you know, the ship, you know, the King\u0026rsquo;s Sapphire sits high above the thunderhead. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the partygoers know. what the plan is, right? I think this is almost like a show just for him, you know? A way to demonstrate his resolve while other people may be panicking.\nBut they, you know, I think, you know– sometimes- once– his parties, he does often park above thunderheads, right? The flash of lightning below serving to be nature\u0026rsquo;s strobe light.\nBut on this occasion, he decides to dive into the thunderhead. And he orders his pilot to bring the ship down to the center of the thunderhead with the waning of the light of the moon and leave it there only until the moon starts to reveal its face again.\nAnd I think that this goes exactly as you\u0026rsquo;d expect, right? And that is poorly.\nThe ship descends into the thundercloud as the moon\u0026rsquo;s light starts to fade, and the guests are, you know– they see them lowering the ship a bit, and they\u0026rsquo;re like kind of, \u0026ldquo;Ha ha ha ha, okay, this is fun, um! I\u0026rsquo;m kind of getting a little close to it, though.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then they start to kind of give way to panic, right? I mean, as I would, too, if… you know, \u0026ldquo;This is your captain speaking. We are going to be experiencing a moment of intense turbulence, um, because I am fly– I am choosing to fly us into a thundercloud. Sorry, prince\u0026rsquo;s orders.\u0026rdquo;\nSo the guests start to panic, right? They start to get really nervous. And I think the prince is the only one, like, just still kind of being very blasé about it. You know, very much like, oh, you know, like, \u0026ldquo;Come on, people! Let\u0026rsquo;s get on the dance floor. This is nature\u0026rsquo;s light show! You don\u0026rsquo;t want to miss this!\u0026rdquo; I think he kills the music and lets the beating of the thunder be the beat of his dance, right?\nAnd I think he\u0026rsquo;s really, you know– he likes the idea of this so much that when lightning strikes the ship, it takes him a good, solid, like… ten seconds to realise that they\u0026rsquo;re falling out of the sky.\nNow, you know, clouds are pretty high up there, and the air is pretty thin up there, and I think they\u0026rsquo;re on an open deck, right? There\u0026rsquo;s got to be some way to keep themselves warm, you know. Maybe like a heated floor that kind of projects heat up a little bit. And, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s- it is when lightning strikes the ship that the ship\u0026rsquo;s power starts to fail, right? I described it earlier as the ship having a heart, so it is kind of like that electric shock that stops your heart for a little bit. And so similarly, this lightning strike has stopped my heart. My- me. The King\u0026rsquo;s Sapphire.\nAnd so the prince is busting a move and he feels like the earth… well, no, he feels the ground kind of, like, tilt underneath him and a sense of vertigo come over. And he thinks it\u0026rsquo;s, like, you know– it\u0026rsquo;s the thrill of his, you know– this is him at the, like, apotheosis of his party, right? Like, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get any better than this.\nAnd then he feels cold because the heated floors have quit, too. And then he feels cold on the inside, because he realises they are falling.\nAnd it just looks like rain rushing upwards, right? Because, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of what clouds are. They\u0026rsquo;re just like rain up in the sky, right? So instead of the rain falling down, it\u0026rsquo;s rushing upwards as like flashes of light, lightning strike off in the distance of this cloud, and he can feel the ship pitch and yaw as the guests freak out.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re panicking. Their wine glasses are smashing against the floor. There\u0026rsquo;s people confessing their love to each other. Some people confessing their dislove for each other. [Laughing] You know? Some people… you know… someone being like, \u0026ldquo;I knew I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have come on this party.\u0026rdquo; You know, like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t even like the prince anyway,\u0026rdquo; as it careens towards the ground.\nAnd, you know, back at the bridge, the pilot, right, is fighting with the controls, right? Trying to glide the ship down or trying to regain some sense of control. I think the ship is… I mean, obviously it\u0026rsquo;s saved. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to break upon the ground on my… this isn\u0026rsquo;t even my first flight. This is just a silly party in pursuit of novelty and excitement. I think Galoom, the shipwright, is… well, he does believe in organic design. He also believes in functionality as well. And so from the– he did design the ship– while, you know… hard to control without the power steering, can still be brought down safely if the ship were to lose power. And so I think it plummets from the sky, but eventually the pilot is able to… rein and rest control from gravity and cause the King Sapphire to spread its wings and bring it down to a very slow glide and bring it back down into control once they are underneath the thunderhead.\nRain pours down on the deck as guests are cast all across the party\u0026rsquo;s floor. Tables are upturned. There is not a… there is not an unsmashed glass or shaken spirit out on the party floor. And I think, you know, finally, in a moment kind of contrary to his nature, the prince can only, like, muster up a very, like, squeaky and soft and meek, like, \u0026ldquo;Sorry?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he storms off into his chambers because he couldn\u0026rsquo;t have done anything wrong. And he refuses to repeat it again.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo \u0026amp; otherwise self-paced TTRPGs.

Today, we\u0026rsquo;re going to see the rest of their time with us and meet our second captains.\nGAME: FIRST ERA (CONT\u0026rsquo;D) SECOND REFIT SATAH: Okay.\nCONNOR: Okay, now I\u0026rsquo;m going to…\nCALEB: And now I…\nCONNOR: Draw a card for a second chance of a refit.\nCALEB: Draw a card for a second chance of refit.\nSATAH: Next step is to draw a card for a second chance of a refit.\nCONNOR: No. I drew a heart, so that means no refit for me.\nCALEB: Diamonds. Nope. No refit the second time.\nSATAH: I drew a club, which does not match one of my captain\u0026rsquo;s card… s. So, no refit! We\u0026rsquo;re good to go. We\u0026rsquo;re all set.\nEVENT CALEB: After that, I draw an event card.\nCONNOR: Okay. So now I\u0026rsquo;m going to go to my first flights.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Draw a card and turn to the\nCALEB \u0026amp; SATAH: first flights prompt table.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: Spades. So this is a harrowing flight. Uh-oh. More harrowing flights. Who gave this guy a boat?!\nSATAH: I drew a diamond.\nCALEB: My next card is hearts.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;If you draw a diamond or a heart, choose a prompt from notable firsts.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Answer the prompt that speaks to my heart and then cross it out.\u0026rdquo; Okay.\nCONNOR: Um… uh oh. I have to decide? Actually, I know when Satah did this, they just rolled a d6.\nSATAH: I hate choosing. Luckily, this table is beautifully numbered one to six. So, rollin\u0026rsquo; my little d6. [Die rolling] Six: \u0026ldquo;Memento Mori. Your voyage brings you across the remains of a creatur too big to be believed. How does your crew react?\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s fascinating.\nI do think… that first, this is an indication that Laura took– the crew members who retired back to her hometown? She took their criticism seriously and has started going places a little more adventurously. Maybe not immediately, because first they need to play that game hard for six months so that she can make sure everybody\u0026rsquo;s getting paid what they\u0026rsquo;re worth. [Laughing] Sorry to the hometown people who clearly weren\u0026rsquo;t. Whatever. It is what it is.\nBut then, yeah, they start exploring more again. We\u0026rsquo;re in the sky. Hmm.\nThis, I think, is a creature that is legendary amongst sailors for destroying ships. This is one of the reasons that a skyship is safer than a ship in the water, because this is just this giant… god, I… I was like– I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I want to do, you know, kraken. And then I was like, what are other big fucked up creatures? And then I was like, the sea already has… they\u0026rsquo;ve already done all the fucked up stuff. Just, like, nature. I can\u0026rsquo;t be more creative than the actual ocean.\nBut I think it\u0026rsquo;s– pulling, of course, on one of my favourite fucked up sea creatures, which is the anglerfish. The idea of this giant anglerfish that, like, has a light that is big enough to look like a lighthouse.\nAnd I think that it– I don\u0026rsquo;t think– I think the tales that are told of this creature are that it attacks ships on purpose. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s true. I think that what it is, is that it just has like… it\u0026rsquo;s not a deep sea creature. It is like a– like a water skimmer, you know? Like those like bugs that will just hop along the water. It\u0026rsquo;s like that, but enormous. And it like– it breathes in and out. And when it breathes out– I think it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat on the surface and somewhat under the surface. And because it\u0026rsquo;s so huge, it being under the surface, like you could technically just sail over it. But because it\u0026rsquo;s breathing out, it\u0026rsquo;s causing these whirlpools and this like wave– these waves and just chaos. I think it breathes very slowly and unpredictably and so you never know when the water is going to be clear and when it\u0026rsquo;s suddenly going to be this horrible storm.\nAnd it does look like– it– it\u0026rsquo;s the– it\u0026rsquo;s– the false sense of safety makes it even worse, right? It looks like a lighthouse. It looks like this is going to be clear water.\nThough– lighthouses are are saying, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t come here.\u0026rdquo; Right? They\u0026rsquo;re they\u0026rsquo;re marking like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, there\u0026rsquo;s an outcropping here. Don\u0026rsquo;t fuckin\u0026rsquo; run into it.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s interesting to me. Yeah.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s told– it\u0026rsquo;s talked about as a threat, right? Where it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Ooh, it\u0026rsquo;s drawing you in. It\u0026rsquo;s saying, \u0026lsquo;Hey, there\u0026rsquo;s a- there\u0026rsquo;s– this is safety,\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; when actually it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s doing what a lighthouse is supposed to do in a lot of ways, which is say like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, careful.\u0026rdquo; Like, \u0026ldquo;You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to see– you can\u0026rsquo;t see the danger. Let me illuminate it for you.\u0026rdquo;\nThis– it isn\u0026rsquo;t the only one of its kind, you know, there are a lot of them. And I think that probably, like, they can go underwater for long periods of time? You know, they have air reserves or something, but they do have to come up.\nAnd we see one… we\u0026rsquo;re flying over it. This is the privilege of a skyship. We realise like, okay, we\u0026rsquo;ve got our full crew back. We can go where a lot of people can\u0026rsquo;t. Let\u0026rsquo;s do it.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s like… is it floating? Is it beached?\nI think we\u0026rsquo;re flying and we know that we\u0026rsquo;re looking for an island and someone points it out and says, \u0026ldquo;Is that it? It\u0026rsquo;s a little too soon, right?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd everyone sort of, you know, hops on the telescopes and whatever. We\u0026rsquo;re looking and realise like, oh… it\u0026rsquo;s one of those creatures. And I think what it is is that when they die they naturally float up to the surface until all of the air that they had was expelled and then they sink back down. And so we\u0026rsquo;re seeing this, like, moment, almost. I think it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s not– they\u0026rsquo;re huge, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s a– it\u0026rsquo;s a couple hours but it\u0026rsquo;s still relatively, like, a moment that they are dead and visible. And we\u0026rsquo;re watching the ripples. The water is churning. I wish you could see my silly little witch hands like wiggling my fingers as I\u0026rsquo;m describing the water churning.\nThe water is churning as all of the air is expelling out of their body. And then it sinks when it\u0026rsquo;s empty.\nI imagine a lot of the crew knows people who have died… and I wonder if one of the things here is that there\u0026rsquo;s been no study done on it, because how could there be, yet? And so it\u0026rsquo;s the– the running theory is that these things cause the tumultuous water on purpose. They\u0026rsquo;re like, flapping or flailing, or doing something on purpose to attack these ships, right? To make the water unbearable. But this creature is so clearly dead and the water is still churning. And this is the first thing of like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, is this just like a physiological thing that they can\u0026rsquo;t control?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think for some people on the crew, that\u0026rsquo;s comforting. And for some, it\u0026rsquo;s deeply disturbing. Because like, oh, what? It\u0026rsquo;s just random? It\u0026rsquo;s like any storm? [Laughing] Yeah.\nAnd I think one of the things that\u0026rsquo;s really interesting to me as playing the ship, basically, is that like… every single person on the crew at some point privately expresses gratitude for me.\nIt starts, like, when they get a view of this creature, of the remains of this creature, a couple of them like… squeeze their hands on the- the walls on the– on the deck of the ship. They\u0026rsquo;re, like– on the railings, squeeze, because they\u0026rsquo;re thinking, \u0026ldquo;Oh, god, if we were in a regular ship, we\u0026rsquo;d be down there. I\u0026rsquo;m so glad we\u0026rsquo;re not.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that kind of that idea sort of occurs to everybody over the course of the next ten hours. I get a lot of hands pressed against my- my- my bulkheads and someone starts a song that they haven\u0026rsquo;t sung in a while that\u0026rsquo;s about… you know, just a big crew work song about the superiority of flight.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s boastful on purpose. It\u0026rsquo;s like a work song that\u0026rsquo;s meant to often be sung in docks to make fun of everyone around you who has to travel by land or water rather than by sky and to flex and show off how cool you are. [Laughs] And they haven\u0026rsquo;t sung it in a while because, whatever, they\u0026rsquo;re busy. They don\u0026rsquo;t– they- and- and- and they don\u0026rsquo;t want to– their focus isn\u0026rsquo;t on jostling other crews. But in this- in this moment, after all of that, as they\u0026rsquo;re all realising how lucky they are, they sing it while they\u0026rsquo;re working. It\u0026rsquo;s nice.\nCALEB: Heart: \u0026ldquo;notable firsts: discoveries, marvels, and wonders. Word spreads and fame grows. Tales of your voyages circulate. Your name and your captain\u0026rsquo;s grow famous. What spurs your sudden popularity?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re going to name this captain real quick. Her name is Admiral… Admiral Glavik. I– can you tell that when I\u0026rsquo;m making names, I just start writing letters in my journal until a sound pops out? That\u0026rsquo;s how we got Colma. And that is how we got Glavik.\nSo Admiral Glavik and I, the Greenblade, who wield the long nines. uh, become famous as tales of our voyages circulate.\nI think we\u0026rsquo;re famous for a bunch of reasons. One of those reasons is if you see us, you can guess that the emperor\u0026rsquo;s on it. And it\u0026rsquo;s like… maybe he\u0026rsquo;s almost never on it. Maybe he\u0026rsquo;s never actually been on the ship, but if he\u0026rsquo;s going to be on any ship, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be our ship. So every time anyone sees it, there\u0026rsquo;s that threat of– and that exciting tension, like the emperor could be right there. The emperor could be coming to our town. And if it\u0026rsquo;s not the emperor, it might be one of his closest confidants. And if it\u0026rsquo;s not one of his closest confidants, it might be a bunch of really interesting crystals. [Laughs] So no matter what, if you see us, something interesting is happening, at least from the perspective of the citizens.\nAnd what spurs our sudden popularity, I think, is what I described. We participated in… a fight where nobody survived but us. Not even just our ships– which I think is the original prompt, that it was the others in our fleet– but I think of anyone. I think every other ship crashed. And I think as a result, we are– we made the point. Like we confirmed the Greenblade works. The Greenblade is scary. And the Long Nines are not to be trifled with.\nCONNOR: All right, I have returned with a die. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a nice plain white D6 with some black numbers on it, just so, you know, you at home can follow along with the very die that I\u0026rsquo;m rolling.\n[Die rolling] Six. \u0026ldquo;Desperation, the mother of invention. Something vital breaks while you\u0026rsquo;re under sail. What is it? What makes it vital? And how does your crew manage to keep you sky worthy?\u0026rdquo;\nHmm. Boy, why did I have such an exciting party beforehand? Um!\nYeah, no, let\u0026rsquo;s– I mean, we\u0026rsquo;ve established that, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s a heart inside the ship. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I want to be like, you know, he broke the ship\u0026rsquo;s heart… so maybe we can find something else to break.\nHm. Okay, so let\u0026rsquo;s walk you through my thought process a little bit and see if talking out loud doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually get me to an answer here. So, I mean, again, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about this ship kind of like it\u0026rsquo;s an organic thing. It is blue and it\u0026rsquo;s glimmering and it\u0026rsquo;s translucent. It catches the sun\u0026rsquo;s fire… yeah! Yeah, yeah.\nSo I think the way that this ship is powered is through solar energy. Even King Thundercloud knows to invest in his renewables. Um– [Laughing]\nBut yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s powered on solar energy. And so that glimmering and glinting of fire when you look at the wings from up above near the sun is like a solar panel reaction. That glimmering is not only just like the light of the sun dancing upon its jeweled surface, but it\u0026rsquo;s also like little pulses of energy that fly down through the wings into the core of the ship, into the heart, into the stomach of the King Sapphire to be stored and used for night flights. And in this way, the ship itself is also… very quiet. There\u0026rsquo;s no big combustion engine or anything inside of it that drives it.\nOh, I love discovering more about this ship as I have to talk about it. I think this is a very cool aspect of it. I\u0026rsquo;m– I like being flexible with this, and it\u0026rsquo;s quite cool.\nSo yeah, it draws in electricity, and so the wings naturally have to have some kind of heat shielding. You know, I feel like a fire is too immediate a threat. I feel like this is an insidious threat, you know? Something that\u0026rsquo;s a little bit more subtle.\nI think- I think it\u0026rsquo;s a two-part break here. I think the wings stop collecting energy. And the gauge… ooh, yeah, the gauge that, like, you know, the fuel gauge, the gauge that tells, you know, the pilot how much… juice is left in the boat is broken \u0026lsquo;cause the ship got hit by lightning a while ago. Because the, you know, the prince is not the greatest at planning for the future.\nSo I think it is… they are high over the ocean, right? And I feel like this– I don\u0026rsquo;t know why– when I think of like, you know, sky ship worlds, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of like archipelagos… is that how you pronounce that? [Shifting the emphasis of the word to be correct] Archipelagos? Anyway, you know, like, I imagine, like, a lot of, like, island continents and stuff, right? Like, small land masses, very seldom– you know, I see, like, them flying over big oceans or even oceans where, like, the- the sea itself seems to fall, like… you know, an oceanic waterfall as the water plunges into the core of the planet, right? Is it even a spherical planet? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t know! Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll get a prompt that forces me to answer that. But today is not that day.\nSo yeah, so they\u0026rsquo;re flying high over the ocean. They\u0026rsquo;re far away from any port. So something vital breaks; the ship runs out of power. And \u0026ldquo;how does your crew manage to keep you sky worthy?\u0026rdquo; Hmm.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the thing. I\u0026rsquo;ve already established that the pilot knows how to kind of handle the ship when it\u0026rsquo;s spinning out, right? When it\u0026rsquo;s losing control. So I feel like the pilot is laid up right now. I think they\u0026rsquo;re sick. And they\u0026rsquo;re very- they\u0026rsquo;re very- you know– not like, anything life-threatening, but, you know, when your tummy hurt. So much. You can\u0026rsquo;t fly plane. You know? That can happen and not be life-threatening.\nAnd so it is the prince that is on the bridge when this happens. And I think this is where… yeah, yeah, I think this is where the prince can\u0026rsquo;t just order his way out of this situation. Yeah, he was put on the bridge to be like, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be easy. He\u0026rsquo;s taken some very basic flying things before, and it\u0026rsquo;s very much, you know– there\u0026rsquo;s like a lot of auto- autopilots and stuff so it\u0026rsquo;s just, you know. Point it in the right direction, the ship will go there, and it\u0026rsquo;ll take care of itself. Just, you know, keep an eye on the fuel gauge and stuff. [Conspiratorially:] Which is not working!!\nUm– yeah! And then what- what happens is that the ship starts to- to list very slightly, uh and the prince doesn\u0026rsquo;t realise this, and, you know, people aren\u0026rsquo;t really paying super super hard attention to any of the controls. And then it starts to tilt even more and it starts to accelerate as it starts to tip and fall out of the air.\nAnd I think the prince has to swallow his pride here. I think not being able to order people to save him from this situation, he\u0026rsquo;s on his comms, which… I imagine right now are a bit of a fun little series of tubes, right? Like you\u0026rsquo;re basic, like, I\u0026rsquo;m talking into a horn and there\u0026rsquo;s a horn somewhere else on the other side of the ship that spits it out.\nSo he\u0026rsquo;s trying to talk to the pilot and the pilot\u0026rsquo;s there, you know, lying in bed, tummy full of hurt right now, trying to tell the prince how to like steer the ship, you know, is like… \u0026ldquo;first, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to engage the central manifold.\u0026rdquo;\nHe\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know where the central manifold is!\u0026rdquo;\nHe\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got to look for the red lever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is red?!\u0026rdquo;\nHe\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;You really don\u0026rsquo;t know what the colour red is?!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhh! I have a very limited education!\u0026rdquo; [Laughing] \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten by very much on my family name up until now.\u0026rdquo; [Lauging] So–\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s like, it\u0026rsquo;s the colour of the wine you drink.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I know what red is!\u0026rdquo; So he pulls the lever and engages that central manifold.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, now you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to disengage, um… the power, you know, the engine clutch.\u0026rdquo; Or– not the engine clutch, like the mechanic– what is it? Like, the servos? The servos? Yeah, there\u0026rsquo;s servos on this. Yeah, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got to disengage the servos on the– for the wings of the plane in order to enable manual control.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s a servo?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he says, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but we have them.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of the prince learning to listen to somebody that he\u0026rsquo;s kind of seen as lesser for the first time. And it is a moment of panic, and… you know, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t open his eyes immediately, because he is very slow to learn. But it does have him– you know, he is able to eventually keep the ship skyworthy, right? He is able to engage the glide and coast for a decent amount of time while the rest of the crew is able to do repairs to reconnect the disengaged power couplings and gather enough power to keep the ship aloft and floating.\nUm, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think he, like, necessarily acknowledges that it is him having listened to somebody else, but rather… it\u0026rsquo;s him starting to feel a sense of control, right? I don\u0026rsquo;t think he\u0026rsquo;s fully recognised that in having so much– monarchistic? Monarchistic?– control by virtue of being royalty, right, that he\u0026rsquo;s never really experienced true control. And by true control– the same sense that we are able to step out the door and go to the store. We choose to go there. And so much of his life has been dictated for him. The expectations that have been laid out for him by virtue of him being royalty. That, yeah, for the first time, he is able to fight and overcome a hardship and feel in control in that way. And to wrest back this. And this is more exciting to him than any eclipse party that he has had thus far.\nAnd so… it gives him a newfound respect for the pilot, for the crew, for the people who have ferried him just kind of from port to port, from place to place. And he sees and starts to feel an enormous… maybe even envy for them. And he starts taking more active participation in his commission here. You know, what initially started off as a kind of, like, a hedonistic pleasure craft has slowly turned into… I mean, like still– he still parties! Oh yeah, he still parties. But it\u0026rsquo;s not just a yacht, right, at this point. It is truly something that he starts to feel pride in. And he starts to get himself all covered in in grease and muck as he starts to want to learn kind of the ins and outs and he\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026ldquo;Why does this- why does this room kind of just open up to a nice scenic view? and the shipwright\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026ldquo;Uh, well, see the thing is, uh, Galoom made it that way, um, and that\u0026rsquo;s just kind of the way it is.\u0026rdquo; And he starts to kind of learn the natural order of of things a little bit more.\nAnd so this this moment is the is the catalyst that doesn\u0026rsquo;t only keep the ship sky worthy, but starts to make Prince Thundercloud a little bit sky worthy as well.\nTIME PASSES CALEB: After an event card, I draw a Time Passes card.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Draw a card as time passes and you find your way into the service of a new captain. Take a moment to reflect. Turn to the time prompt table. If you draw a diamond or a heart, answer a \u0026lsquo;This Hull, Our Home\u0026rsquo; prompt…\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: I got a diamonds.\nCONNOR: I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a heart.\nSATAH: Okay, I drew a club.\n\u0026ldquo;If you draw a club or a spade, answer a \u0026lsquo;The Way Of All Things\u0026rsquo; prompt of your choice.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB \u0026amp; CONNOR: \u0026ldquo;This Hull, Our Home.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;The crews and captains leave their mark.\u0026rdquo;\nOkay, you know what that means. Another choose one of six, which means it\u0026rsquo;s time to roll a d6. Thank you for this idea, Satah. I did appreciate you having solved this problem for me.\nCALEB: Let me look at these.\nCONNOR: Okay, here we go. [Die clattering] A five.\nCALEB: Oh, I like this. Okay.\nCONNOR: [Laughing] \u0026ldquo;Mind yourself, she\u0026rsquo;s particular.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Mind yourself, she\u0026rsquo;s particular. What tradition or superstition about you is passed on between crews and captains? What do you think of it?\u0026rdquo;\nI think as this group moves on, there\u0026rsquo;s an interesting superstition that has to do with something that nobody even really knows about, which is what I mentioned with the metal of my design being off. As a result of using the incorrect metal, the ship itself is actually imbalanced. Not just heavier, but a little bit imbalanced. We\u0026rsquo;ll tilt to one side or the other just a little bit in particular wind conditions.\nAnd there are two results of that. One is that the people who pilot me are more… they have to get used to that, and they often get used to it over time in kind of a gentle way. They understand that they need to shift just a little more to the left, to the right in given circumstances, which makes the people who pilot me seem even more impressive when they get good at it, because no one else can just pick it up. It takes practice.\nBut also, that subtle shifting, that rocking back and forth, is occasionally interpreted as a commentary or a criticism on the behavior of the crew. They think that if they say something that bothers me or they behave in a way that I find annoying, you can sense it in the gentle tilt of the ship getting just a little harsher. And I think they pass on things that are annoying to me, like loud noises after a certain time, like negative comments about each other on the deck.\nI think the captain maybe knows and the other captains know that what they\u0026rsquo;re doing is creating superstitions that help. Superstitions that boost camaraderie. But some of the crew believes it.\nAnd who knows? Maybe I am tilting because I\u0026rsquo;m annoyed. [Chuckles]\nCONNOR: Gosh, see, this is one of the things that really attracted me to this game was, like, the concept of time passing. And I love the idea of… you know, the ghosts that we leave behind. You know, you need not pass to leave a ghost, right? It\u0026rsquo;s the energy of a place and, like, the way that a ship can be like a battery, and to be charged by your presence, and then when you leave, you know, given the right stimulation, the ship comes to life a little bit more.\nSo yeah, \u0026ldquo;mind yourself, she\u0026rsquo;s particular. What tradition or superstition about you is passed on between crews and captains? What do I think of it?\u0026rdquo; Makes me want to cry!\nI\u0026rsquo;m thinking a little bit about this and I think, you know, the tradition or superstition that is passed on between crews and captains is that under the light of the full moon, you can still hear the music from the parties that my captain used to throw. The groaning of deck boards as feet dance upon it… the hypnotic, rhythmic pulsing of moonlight in my wings fills all those who stray out onto my deck under the full moonlight. Fills them all with a song in their hearts and a desire to dance. And often, they give in, as they dance with the ghosts who have danced upon me before and leave their own two-step on the great dance chart that is plotted upon my floors.\nAnd what do I think of it? Well, I think it\u0026rsquo;s just great. You know? I am filled with music.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;The way of all things.\u0026rdquo; Rollin\u0026rsquo; my D6. Four. \u0026ldquo;Crew go on two feet. But these are not crew. You have uninvited guests in the form of invasive vermin. What are these critters? What do they want? And how do your crew try to control them?\u0026rdquo;\nOh, they\u0026rsquo;re… they\u0026rsquo;re odd mammalian termites that are drawn to this wood, the purple wood, the special homegrown wood that probably the ship is made of as well. This is a new thing to them and they\u0026rsquo;re very drawn to it. They want to eat it. That\u0026rsquo;s what they want to do.\nUh, and the true– how does the crew– true– [Exclamation of surprise over the repeating stumbling] \u0026ldquo;How does the crew try to control them?\u0026rdquo;\nI think that it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s about, uh, looking for something that they want to eat more. And so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of– like, they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re absolutely getting tossed over the sides of the ship as much as possible, but they keep appearing. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of a thing where like, hey, if you– right now, this is an infestation that a lot of ships are dealing with, and unfortunately, they\u0026rsquo;re very drawn to us particularly, so anytime we dock, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that they\u0026rsquo;ll get back in.\nAnd we experiment a lot with trying to find something that they\u0026rsquo;re attracted to that they want to eat more.\nAnd then… I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t- I don\u0026rsquo;t want to… I… should have disavowed myself of this prompt or made them sapient in some way, because I… I am deeply uncomfortable talking about hurting animals, even goofy little invasive vermin. And so, yeah. The crew tries to find stuff that they want to eat more and get them off the boat. And that\u0026rsquo;s it. [Laughing] That\u0026rsquo;s the whole story. That\u0026rsquo;s as much as we need to see on screen here.\nCALEB: And after time passes\u0026hellip; we go into the next era.\nGAME: SECOND ERA CAPTAIN SATAH: Generally, in this game you do two captains per era, except for the final era, but for the pod we\u0026rsquo;re doin\u0026rsquo; one. So.\nCALEB: So! Era two coming at you in just a moment.\nSATAH: The second era, which is subtitled–\nCONNOR: Uh, this one is subtitled\nALL: \u0026ldquo;The fire and the flood.\nCONNOR: Uh, before I start drawing cards here, I\u0026rsquo;ve– I\u0026rsquo;ve just got a little blurb I\u0026rsquo;ve- I\u0026rsquo;ve put in at the start of this recording. So let\u0026rsquo;s- let\u0026rsquo;s kick it off! And you know, Satah, you can do with this whatever you want.\nThe memory of your first friend is a strange one. Odds are you were a fledgling, just starting to learn what it means to fly, back when the world was unknown and the sky was limitless.\nTogether, you laid the foundations of what you will become for the rest of your life, and then… time passes and you find yourselves grown apart. Not due to any fracturing or dramatic break, maybe, but due to the growth of time and how its current just erodes and changes your face.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s always a small part of me that hopes that one day it can be like old times and we can fall back into that same old routine and all of our childish worries in our games.\nSometimes, suddenly, that door closes forever and you find yourself laid up in a dark hangar for years, waiting for the call to fly again. To chart your own path through the sky.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m about to be called again.\nCALEB: Hello, this is Greenblade, wielder of the Long Nines, coming to you in the second era.\nSATAH: First, gonna draw two cards to determine the first captain.\nCALEB: I\u0026rsquo;m drawing two cards. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna miss you, Admiral Glavik, and your crew of scoundrels, but maybe I can do better.\nSATAH: Pulled two clubs, so need to keep drawing \u0026rsquo;til I get a different suit.\nCONNOR: It is a jack of hearts and a nine of spades. The rank doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, just the suit.\nCALEB: [Sing-song] Captain number two, spades and hearts.\nCONNOR: So spades are swift and hearts are dauntless. And here in the Captains of the Second Era, I have my second captain.\nCALEB: That is…\nCALEB \u0026amp; CONNOR: The Vengeful Hunter.\nCALEB: Swift and dauntless. Nice.\nCONNOR: Ooh, I like that. There\u0026rsquo;s some action in there, I think. There\u0026rsquo;s definitely some drama. I love a good vengeance.\nSATAH: Got a spade. Is there a captain that is a club and a spade? Yes. The Vicious Corsair. Ooh!\n\u0026ldquo;You now play home to a cadre of desperate pirates, the corsair chief among them. They are fearsome and have an unlovely reputation. The pirates take care to show no weakness.\u0026rdquo; Oh no, Laura, what happened?! [Laughing]\nCALEB \u0026amp; CONNOR: \u0026ldquo;The seas rise\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;and within them, the monsters which the hunter prizes.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;They are savvy.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;They are savvy.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Unrelenting.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Unrelenting.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;And driven to vengeance by an old wound.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;And driven to vengeance by an old wound.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: Ooh!! Okay.\nCONNOR: Ooh, some Captain Ahab vibes here. Okay.\nCALEB: Okay.\nSATAH: Ugh, okay. Draw a card for a chance of refit.\nFIRST REFIT CONNOR: Ooh, I drew a club, which I don\u0026rsquo;t believe matches my captain\u0026rsquo;s suit, and so as a result, no refits, um. Which is fine, you know? Hey, sometimes– sometimes we change, and sometimes the world changes around us, and that is okay, too.\nSATAH: Got a heart, so nope. Works for them just fine.\nCONNOR: Hearts! I got a refit again. I am lucky.\nWhat do we have? Electrified hull plating!! Yeah, babyyy. That\u0026rsquo;s so cool. Okay.\nSo I have electrified hull plating. We\u0026rsquo;ve already talked about having these, like, charged up sniper rifles at the front with the Long Nines. So we are going to do electrified hull plating. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to consider that to be part of the same system. There was already a built-in system for power, and now the hull is also taking advantage of it.\nJust for fun, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say that one of the trade-offs, though, is that when you fire the Long Nines, during that three second charge-up of the long nines, there\u0026rsquo;s a three second gap in the electrified hull. So the electrified hull does a great job repelling all sorts of weaponry and the newly developing energy weapons, and shocking people who are attempting to board or climb or hurt the ship. But while the sniper rifle is firing, there is a notable weak zone, a zone without protection.\nSATAH: I just want to check how explicitly the game wants me to talk about how this happened. Like why- why Laura Profunda is no longer the captain, why these pirates are. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m going to think about it regardless, but I just want to check if there is a specific, like, ruling about it.\nNope, not particularly. Okay. How explicit do I want to be?\nCONNOR: I think the prince moved on and left me alone in a hangar for a bit, and then… I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much time has passed. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to… try not to answer that. I think it\u0026rsquo;s maybe better to let that– let the past be the past. And, you know, I am going to be the through line through time.\nSATAH: Well, let\u0026rsquo;s do the next step and see what we learn in the prompts and then go from there.\nCAPTAIN\u0026rsquo;S PROMPTS CALEB: \u0026ldquo;Who pays for the hunter\u0026rsquo;s catch? What do they use the Leviathans for?\u0026rdquo; So we\u0026rsquo;ve learned something here. By hunter, they mean that we are hunting actual creatures. For-real monsters. Which I was honestly interpreting the previous passage as monsters in a bit more of a metaphorical sense. But now we\u0026rsquo;re getting Leviathans, capital L.\nCONNOR: I mean, it sounds like off the hop that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to come up with a name for these creatures, is that they are Leviathans, capital-L Leviathans.\n\u0026ldquo;The seas rises, and within them, the monsters…\u0026rdquo; Oh, so am I like a– is it like a sky ship hunting sea monsters? That\u0026rsquo;s kind of cool.\nSATAH: The first prompt is, \u0026ldquo;Describe the Corsair\u0026rsquo;s favorite hunting grounds and the prizes they seek.\u0026rdquo; Hunting grounds for pirates. Mmm… yeah, okay.\nSom still playing off of the image of that– like, flying above that big creature. The idea that these pirates are in the sky above those creatures and they… attack ships that get caught in those– the- the waves? Those- those, uh, those cloudless storms, as… as why not call them. I\u0026rsquo;m sure they\u0026rsquo;re known.\nWhich, I think, like– I think this has always been true. These pirates have always tried to target… but they usually sort of tried to be on either side of these creatures, so that ships that just barely manage to survive and are weak and tired from fighting their way through are much more vulnerable to attack.\nBut now… I think what happened here is that they heard Laura\u0026rsquo;s crew talking about seeing this corpse. And I think that what– how they heard it was somebody was talking excitedly about what they\u0026rsquo;d learned about the biology, right? Or their new theory about the biology. That this wasn\u0026rsquo;t a thing that these creatures were doing on purpose; it was just part of how they breathed, their natural functions.\nAnd unfortunately… you got to be careful where you talk about stuff in a busy, hectic port town. Because the Corsair themself heard this and immediately realized how incredible it would be to be able to be above those ships and be able to just sweep down and take stuff while they\u0026rsquo;re fighting. While they\u0026rsquo;re trying to maintain control.\nCALEB: So we are monster hunting. This boat has been given to a set of monster hunters. And that is really interesting because we just established in the first era that we were, like, top of the line. Did this huge military maneuver. We were made to compete.\nAnd I think– I think the situation has got to be that designs have moved on. Not so much that they\u0026rsquo;ve made, like, ships that are way better than me, but more that something about what Colma discovered, something about the way she built ships… she\u0026rsquo;s gone on to build more.\nAnd I, Greenblade, was amazing for the time. But she is young. She\u0026rsquo;s continued to grow over the past few years. She\u0026rsquo;s now in her twenties. Let\u0026rsquo;s say there\u0026rsquo;s been a ten year shift. And in that time, she\u0026rsquo;s designed many ships, many of whom are more specialised, with more focused abilities. And the Greenblade has fallen out of favour, or at least our particular Greenblade has fallen out of favor with the Empire itself, as sturdier ships are developed for transportation, as faster, smaller ships are developed for the VIPs who need to be moved around.\nWe… while we were at one point the most specialised we could be, are now kind of strangely specialised for targeted sniper rifle combat. And the Empire is still in charge. So eventually we were given as a gift to a captain who was the matriarch of a community who the Empire kind of feared. And I think this is because… they are a community that knows a lot about the Leviathans.\nThe Leviathans are… amphibious beasts. In the real sea and in the sky. The ability to fly and to swim, but who do not have legs and are not able to function on land. So I don\u0026rsquo;t know if amphibious still counts when that\u0026rsquo;s the case? If there\u0026rsquo;s no land involved, but it seems fine to me to say that. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t amphibian just mean both? Two things? Could you be amphibious if you\u0026rsquo;re just land and sky, though? Probably not. Here we– you know what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do. We\u0026rsquo;re going to Google it. Amphibian.\nCONNOR: I think one thing I want to try and do here is maybe just change the name of the ship a little bit, right? Again, I think it\u0026rsquo;s really– it\u0026rsquo;s that great kind of fun narrative that we\u0026rsquo;re stumbling into here where, you know, this, again, recalling that the ship is equal parts like art and science, right? And this– a lot of its pieces were organically grown or, you know, they were organically designed and then artificially grown.\nThe official name of the ship was the King Sapphire, but I think with each captain, I get a new name or at least an alternate or a slightly alteration of the name, right?\nSo I think since this is a hunter ship, I\u0026rsquo;m going to adopt the name the Stalking Sapphire.\nCALEB: Okay. It says it means both kinds of life.\n\u0026ldquo;Animals in the air and water.\u0026rdquo; Nothing. I\u0026rsquo;m getting nothing. Okay. All right. They\u0026rsquo;re amphibious is what they are. And that\u0026rsquo;s going to be the end of that.\nLeviathans are amphibious beasts that fly through the air and swim in the sea, and the Empire does not know what to do with them.\nBut there are an entire community of people who hunts them and keeps them from getting too– too powerful in number so that they can\u0026rsquo;t like swarm, you know, the land, eating all of our birds and destroying all of our skyships. But they also sometimes use them as skyships, this community.\nSo this captain was given the Greenblade for a couple reasons. One, to hunt the scariest leviathans who need a delicate touch. And two, to protect the Empire from other people who might be using these Leviathans to attack the Empire at some point.\nThe Greenblade is specifically good, because it\u0026rsquo;s a sniper, at hitting and causing serious damage to Leviathans. Whereas… it was much harder for me to deal direct damage to other ships now that they\u0026rsquo;ve developed things like the electrified hull plating, which do resist the Long Nines.\nI love that.\nSATAH: Did the Corsair kill Laura or is she okay?\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a die. Uh, evens, Laura was off the ship or something and is safe. Odds, they kill her. [Die rolling] Evens. So.\nI think what it is, is that most of the crew is off enjoying leave. And Laura is on the ship. It gets boarded by pirates as it\u0026rsquo;s docked. And I think that they basically say like, \u0026ldquo;Hey. You can let us take the ship now or we can kill you, and then we will wait for your crew to come back and we\u0026rsquo;ll kill them too.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd she is not willing to put her crew in danger like that. And so she just leaves. She just gets off the ship. And the Corsair just takes it.\nDid any of the crew betray and come with? No. Whole new crew.\nCONNOR: Let\u0026rsquo;s go with the captain\u0026rsquo;s name, right? Not royalty, truly just a hunter. I\u0026rsquo;m going to say Captain Arteria. And… ooh, okay!\nSo. I think shipwrights pay for the hunters– for Captain Arteria\u0026rsquo;s catch.\nCALEB: The government pays when I kill a major Leviathan– when the hunter kills it. And the Leviathans are used for… in keeping with the idea that the Greenblade is often piloted by people who are working for themselves within a much bigger system, I think the Vengeful Hunter sometimes doesn\u0026rsquo;t kill the Leviathans and instead captures them to sell them to the very people that she is supposed to be protecting against.\nCONNOR: I\u0026rsquo;ve referred to, um, these ships as having a heartbeat, as having an engine, right? As being kind of made up of strange, organic-looking structures. And so I think it would be… yeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s really cool if it is the hearts of these Leviathans that are used to power skyships.\nCALEB: Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;re just captured to be sold, and sometimes they are killed and used for parts. [Gasp] Oh my gosh! Okay. Alright.\nThe metal that Colma originally intended for me to be built with, that is holding me back, my limiters. Part of what makes it amazing it that it is a metal processed by a Leviathan eating sediment. And as it eats that sediment, it converts it into bones, kind of. It\u0026rsquo;s unusual for a fish to have bones like this maybe, but… or like sharks usually have cartilage, right? But it converts it into bones. These thin bones that are a metal you can\u0026rsquo;t find anywhere else, created from the Leviathan\u0026rsquo;s kind of, like, um, acidic body and its diet of mineral.\nAnd so one of the things that comes from hunting Leviathans is every once in a while, you hit the motherlode jackpot of a Leviathan that has lived long enough and eaten enough of the land to have an entire skeleton made of this metal that was supposed to go into my construction.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;re used for.\nBut they\u0026rsquo;re also sometimes food.\nCONNOR: I think as a ship, I feel conflicted about this, right? Because when I see another ship in the sky, I feel a sense of freedom. I feel a sense of kinship when another ship pings on my radar and I can see its sails billowing in the bright blue sky.\nBut… to have to hunt these Leviathans to bring more of those into the world, I think it starts having… can a ship have an existential crisis? I think I am. I think as a boat, the Stalking Sapphire is starting to have- is going to have an existential crisis. You know, starting to wonder.\nI was brought into this world by an act of… eccentric, maybe misguided, but love, right? I was created by Galoom, and I was given my secret name. But I have not realised I have also been born of an act of violence.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s hard to try and reconcile these two things. Especially to continue to perpetuate that kind of violence, right?\nSATAH: The ships that are willing to cross dangerous territory are probably desperate or important. And both of those things are valuable. They can be– they\u0026rsquo;re differently applicable, but they\u0026rsquo;re valuable. If they\u0026rsquo;re important, then whatever they have on board is certainly worth something. If they\u0026rsquo;re desperate… I\u0026rsquo;m sure that that\u0026rsquo;s how they\u0026rsquo;ve got– that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of how they get crew. [Laughs] And just take them for all they\u0026rsquo;re worth as much as possible.\nCONNOR: Maybe as, like, cities are like near- nearby, like, the coasts, Leviathans often, um, launch attacks on these cities. Maybe- maybe there\u0026rsquo;s, like, some, uh, drive that they have to cause the sea to reclaim the land.\nLeviathans are an act of nature. Yes. Yeah, they are– you know, we– when a tsunami happens, it is a true force of nature. It is the sea swallowing up the land. And I love the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s like– you know, it is futile to fight against the tides. It is futile to fight against the waves. Because you can never kill a wave.\nBut what if you could?\nCaptain Arteria, she is a… I see, like, a crimson-haired, almost sharp jawline. And just gray eyes or something. Just like, you know, eyes that have maybe seen too much. And she has been driven to vengeance because she grew up in a seaside village who, you know, marveled at the skyships and marveled at the sea, but they really sought to live in… you know, give respect and honour the sea for all it gives us, right, you won\u0026rsquo;t awaken the ire of the Leviathans.\nAnd I think her home was destroyed by a Leviathan.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Tell the story of the Hunter\u0026rsquo;s wounding by a particular Leviathan and the day they have their opportunity for revenge.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: I think Arteria was training as a… rope maker. A ropesmith? Yes.\nAnd on the day she was to open her own shop– so, she apprenticed for many years, um– her- her village was destroyed by a Leviathan.\nCALEB: Imagine a giant narwhal. This whale-like Leviathan with a long, sharp horn on its head. Unlike a narwhal, though, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a rounded, smooth body. It has the segmented body of a worm that sort of wriggles through the air. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s scaly. A scaly worm wriggling into the air with basically a sword on its face, a giant sword, as long as the Long Nines, if not bigger.\nAnd it made a nuisance of itself because its coiling segmented shape allowed it to, on the water, curl up at the bottom of the ocean in shallow water, below flying skyships in the air, and like a spring, launch itself upwards from underneath the waves when you couldn\u0026rsquo;t even see it, directly into the ships above.\nCONNOR: I think each Leviathan is different and unique. I think they all have a similar internal physiology, but externally they are strange and bizarre and truly alien.\nCALEB: This thing seemed to know what it was doing. It knew how to kill these skyships. It learned how to be a predator against the people of this Empire specifically. And the Empire was sick of it.\nThey sent us to spend months. It took literally months to find this thing because of the way it attacked. It would leap into the air, spear a ship, let the ship fall, and then escape for a while until it found its way back to pick through the drowned bodies, whatever it didn\u0026rsquo;t eat immediately.\nCONNOR: So I think this many-eyed, many-limbed creature that looks like a football stadium rising up out of the sea, pulsing with light and making a sound like a tree trunk splitting and popping on its way down to the ground, caused a wave that swept her town out to sea.\nAnd it is unknown why this happened, and it\u0026rsquo;s unfair that it happened. And she didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to cope with it, right?\nAnd when she got over feeling sad about it, she… actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t think she got over it. I think she turned her sadness into anger. I think it was a moment of, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t be stuck feeling sad all my life, so I am going to use anger to move myself forward.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think she trained, amassed a small fortune, and purchased me from the hangar. Was– is the monarchy still around? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But I was purchased from the hangar, and I was there the day that she had her revenge.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Tell the story of the day they got more than they bargained for when they swept down on a likely target.\u0026rdquo;\nThe first thought I had was that this was a honeypot of some kind. A ship that came out on purpose. A ship that… can fly, that camouflaged itself as one that couldn\u0026rsquo;t, that came out to attack these pirates. Like, yeah, \u0026ldquo;Come and get me, and then we\u0026rsquo;re going to take you down.\u0026rdquo;\nDo I want it to be that purposeful, or do I really want it to be like, oh, you just– you really just coincidentally fucked with the wrong people?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a coincidence. It\u0026rsquo;s just a random ship. But a couple of the crew members of this ship used to work on The Catching Net years ago.\nCONNOR: I think she\u0026rsquo;s spent… she\u0026rsquo;s gone out with me a number of times hunting. And she\u0026rsquo;s always listening for that sound of the exploding trees of a forest aflame… or like the biggest sheet of bubble wrap you\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. Um…\nCALEB: One day, the hunter was wounded by the Leviathan, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t personally. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that the spear stabbed straight through the Hunter herself.\nWe were docked along the coast of the continent, waiting for a ship that was bringing the Hunter\u0026rsquo;s daughter. A teenager who I had never met– I, Greenblade, had never met– because she\u0026rsquo;d never come to the ship before.\nShe was asked to come here. She was sent from home for the Hunter because it was time for her to be trained to become my captain one day.\nBut the ship that brought her across the waves, down the coast, was speared by this great Leviathan, and by horrible horrible chance, when we heard of a ship being destroyed and we sped there immediately, there was no saving her.\nCONNOR: She hears it one day, right? I think she goes out in search of another Leviathan. Um, I think she\u0026rsquo;s always chasing tails, right, uh, trying to find the one that destroyed her home.\nAnd finally, she comes across it. I think she maybe- maybe she refers to it as like The Tree Splitter or something. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it The Tree Splitter, just to give it a name, right, instead of just the generic Leviathan.\nAnd I think when she finds it, she hesitates. I think she changes her her tact, right? She was– she was very uncompromising with all the other Leviathans. I think when she– whenever she would make a hunt and whenever she would make her kill, it would be a, you know, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not the one I want. This is just business. I\u0026rsquo;m just doing this.\u0026rdquo; And she would make the kill and then leave or make the kill, harvest what she needs from the Leviathan, and then leave.\nBut I think that inability to get answers from what happened to her is what makes her hesitate.\nCALEB: Many survived, but the spear of the Leviathan stabbed straight through her.\nSATAH: I think Laura got a new ship and hired a bunch of people and tried her best,but it was never quite the same, right? And- and a lot of them have dispersed. And we\u0026rsquo;re not following her story, or their story, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nBut a couple of the crew that worked on The Catching Net have ended up here, on this ship, crossing this ocean in the exact way they were so grateful to not have to do anymore. But what that means is they know the Net\u0026rsquo;s vulnerabilities.\nAnd so the pirates board and pick– I picture them, like, hovering beside, like out of the reach of the waves, just able to hop on and get off easily. Not easily, but… [Laughs] they manage to make it work.\nAnd these former crew members board them. They also take the opportunity in the chaos to get on the ship.\nDo they try to take it down or do they just try to get away? I think that they\u0026rsquo;re trying to reclaim it. Like they\u0026rsquo;re trying to be like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, maybe we can just take the ship.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: She flies above Tree Splitter, which is currently breaching in the middle of the ocean, right? It is coming up, and she looks upon, like, a blue island of, like, limbs.\nYou know what? Yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s get weird with it. It\u0026rsquo;s, like, instead of fur– it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s covered in fur. But instead of like fur itself, it\u0026rsquo;s actually like, you know, hands. Like, arms– like, just forearms and shoulders with hands at the end, and they\u0026rsquo;re all just, like, grasping and flowing along.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s how it propels itself. It is– it is a million, million swimming arms. Just a nexus of hands. And I think it is, like, all of them slapping against the water that makes this popping sound.\nCALEB: The captain was, of course, devastated. And we had already been commanded to kill this thing. We were about to start that mission But the Hunter became obsessed, made us all work around the clock searching for this creature.\nAnd finally, revenge only came because of the Hunter\u0026rsquo;s schemes.\nShe didn\u0026rsquo;t warn them, but she baited a trap for the Leviathan. She set up a ship that the Leviathan couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist, a ship full of people, raucous and noisy, like a cruise line. A skyship cruise line that was on a short journey. The captain found them in port and said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but by order of the Empire, you can\u0026rsquo;t go along your normal route. You can\u0026rsquo;t follow these safe channels. You have to take a shortcut. The Empire is using this area for something important. And besides, there\u0026rsquo;s a storm!\u0026rdquo;\nSo an entire cruise ship of people were sent into the territory of the Leviathan.\nCONNOR: I think her need for vengeance is superseded by her need for answers. I i think she\u0026rsquo;s– she\u0026rsquo;s very headstrong at this point, and I think she lowers– she gets the ship hovering like– again, it\u0026rsquo;s a stealth ship so maybe totally unnoticed, hovering maybe about fifty feet above the Leviathan\u0026rsquo;s form.\nAnd this thing is massive, right? It\u0026rsquo;s nothing but hands as far as the eye can see across the horizon.\nAnd I think she takes her first… no, no. Her last. The last rope she ever made before she was going to open her own shop, and she uses that to lower herself down onto the ship– or, onto the Leviathan.\nAnd I think when she is there… I mean, she\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s grasped at by these hands, right\u0026gt; They they do not– they\u0026rsquo;re not terribly strong, right? They\u0026rsquo;re they\u0026rsquo;re almost like– they kind of look like jellyfish a little bit. But. She\u0026rsquo;s able to break free from their grasps fairly easily\nBut she stands there amongst this island of hands, just clasping up towards the sky. She pulls her saber from its scabbard and wants to so badly plunge this into this beast, knowing, you know, this is not but a splinter on this Leviathan.\nAnd I– she just lets out, like… she digs within herself, and she finds that… twisted iron of anger, of grief, right? Of grief manifested into rage.\nAnd she screams, her throat tearing from the force of the yell.\nHer crew up above in the ship stare down and kind of look at each other and it\u0026rsquo;s like, you know, do we cut our losses? Like, has Captain just, like, you know, gone off the deep end?\nShe screams long and hard, and she gets everything inside of her out.\nAnd the hands stop their clapping. And the sea is quiet. The Tree Splitter is quiet. She chokes a little bit from the force of screaming, I think it coarsened her throat. Hoarsened her throat? Hoarsened her throat.\nUm… and she… feels heard.\nI think in the silence of the Leviathan, the stopping of those hands clapping and slapping, she feels acknowledged, right? Like nature itself has heard her grief and given her a moment of silence that she so needs. And I think together, her and the Leviathan mourn for all the lives that have been lost.\nCALEB: I don\u0026rsquo;t know how she knew. I don\u0026rsquo;t know when the Leviathan was going to attack, but somehow she felt it. She sensed it. Her time obsessed and studying this creature gave her perfect timing for its attack.\nAnd as we watched the cruise ship at a distance, completely still waters, nothing anywhere, no sign of anything, she demanded the Long Nines be activated.\nThree… two… and in one single instant, as the Long Nines fired, the Leviathan\u0026rsquo;s coil launched it out of the water, straight for the cruise ship, and it was pierced directly through the head in the exact moment it pierced the ship. And at least 200 people plunged to their death that day.\nCONNOR: She says no more and climbs back up the rope, but not before tying the other end around one of the arms of the Leviathan.\nBack up on the ship, I think she… grabs a tracking device and ties it to the other end of her last rope. She casts it off the side of the ship and she flies away.\nCALEB: From the horn on the Leviathan\u0026rsquo;s head, the metal of my body was finally replaced. And for the first time ever, my construction matched Colma\u0026rsquo;s designs exactly.\nCONNOR: And I think she hangs up her sword here.\nI think she continues to fly, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think she continues to fly to hunt and kill. I think she starts to fly to monitor and document. Because she\u0026rsquo;s been heard, and she\u0026rsquo;s felt her pain be acknowledged, and while she may never have the answers as to why, she always knows where to go when she needs to look her past in the face.\nSATAH: They\u0026rsquo;re trying to see if they can take the ship. They don\u0026rsquo;t. Because… this is still my captain for the rest of this era.\nBut I think they do manage to take control of it. And then the Corsair themself sweeps into the engine room or whatever. And they have a very– the classic, very threatening invitation to the crew.\nLike the Corsair doing like a, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re clever. You\u0026rsquo;re vicious. You\u0026rsquo;re resourceful,\u0026rdquo; while, like, flipping a knife in their fingers. And just saying a bunch of stuff about them that comes across as insulting, but then finally is like, \u0026ldquo;Do you want to ride with us? Is that– have I misunderstood? Are you doing this out of some sort of loyalty?\u0026rdquo; Gestures with their head to the ship that is still being attacked.\nOr probably not being attacked– everyone has had to retreat because they managed to take the ship. Or no, they\u0026rsquo;re still fighting, but the ship is now far above in the sky.\nAnd the Corsair says, \u0026ldquo;Is this out of loyalty for transport of gunpowder? Or do you just really like my ship?\u0026rdquo; And the two crew members look at each other. And I think the Corsair sort of, like, eyes them and is– cards on the table, slightly more, goes like, \u0026ldquo;The two of you sure found this place quickly. You sure figured out how to maneuver it quickly.\u0026rdquo; And that hangs in the air like a threat. Like a, you know too much, I should kill you. And then the Corsair continues, after a long silence, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s useful. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to ask you again. Do you like my ship?\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: She does try to get that answer. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t try and find that answer in fighting things, right? In trying to destroy her pain. I think she tries to understand it more, and in doing so, understanding the Leviathans better.\nSATAH: And the crew members nod slowly, and the Corsair goes, \u0026ldquo;Okay. If you can maneuver us back down and successfully pick up the rest of my crew, welcome aboard. If you can\u0026rsquo;t… well. \u0026quot; And they don\u0026rsquo;t finish the sentence. They leave.\nAnd the crew that worked on The Catching Net under Captain Laura Profunda joins this pirate crew. And it\u0026rsquo;s terrible. And better. They are safer, and ultimately, you know… the pirates got to be loyal to themselves and each other, at least a little bit, so it\u0026rsquo;s better than having to keep finding jobs and being on the water.\nCONNOR: Okay. So I\u0026rsquo;ve answered my captain\u0026rsquo;s prompts. So now I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a card for a second chance of a refit.\nSECOND REFIT SATAH: Alright. Now drawing a card for a second chance of refit.\nCALEB: And that\u0026rsquo;s hearts again, which would be electrified hull plating again. So I\u0026rsquo;m not going to add anything to it, but I think I earned an upgrade. [Laughs] The second hearts is for me getting that metal from the horn of the narwhal beast.\nCONNOR: It is a spade! Ooh! I get a second refit.\nSATAH: Drew spades, which is one of the captain\u0026rsquo;s tags. Swift: station-keeping jets.\nI think, quite simply, this is, like, something that makes it easier– because usually somebody has to be manually and with great difficulty controlling the ship to keep it hovering, as they\u0026rsquo;re attacking, beside one of the other ships, beside the ship that is also fighting the cloudless storm.\nAnd these are just jets that make it, uh, hover above a certain amount above the water. I think somebody still probably has to be at the wheel, especially for if something goes wrong. But this takes a lot of the like manual work out of it.\nCONNOR: My refit as a vengeful Hunter, as a swift, is a dual sweep drive modification. So the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s, hmm… I think it\u0026rsquo;s adding a dual sweep drive. And we all know what dual sweep drives do, right? No? Oh, well then let me tell you.\n[Stage whispering: I don\u0026rsquo;t know what a dual sweep drive does. Give me a second.\nSATAH: I like the idea that one of the crew members, the former Catching Net crew members that they recruited, was the one who was talking excitedly about the biology and is a little bit of a, like, science-y, you know, want– likes to learn, likes to know things.\nAnd they shyly go up to the Corsair at one point and show them a complicated diagram that shows, like, air pressure and the water\u0026rsquo;s reaction.\nThe Corsair looks at it and looks up at them completely deadpan, \u0026ldquo;The fuck is this?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the crew member\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Um! It\u0026rsquo;s an idea. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how you do it, but, um…\u0026rdquo; and explains the idea of, like, being able to hover.\nAnd this, like, gets the Corsair\u0026rsquo;s mind working. And they realise, like, they\u0026rsquo;ve seen this on ships… they use it as part of a docking procedure. It like– there are these jets of the air that are on the side of the ship that they sort of burst out to help keep the ship from crashing into the wall in very, like, narrow ports. Because everything is so, like, DIY and everything, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to always know– and there\u0026rsquo;s like so many conflicting standards. Docking is hard. And this is something that has been added to a lot of ships to help– to make docking in weird ports a little bit safer and easier.\nAnd they basically realise, like, oh, if we– if took some of those and, like, you know, juiced them a little, we can probably use them to do that.\nAnd they absolutely just… [Laughs] there\u0026rsquo;s– next time they see a ship that has those… probably few different ships, actually, they need a few of them, they attack the ship and surprise the crew on the ship they\u0026rsquo;re attacking by not really taking anything from them, by just coming on, threatening them, and then seemingly disappearing. But what they\u0026rsquo;ve actually done is somebody has been sent to the sides of the ship to start ripping these jets off.\nAnd after they\u0026rsquo;ve attacked, like, three to five ships that have them, they have enough, and they tinker with them, and they now have these jets that will help them hover beside ships they\u0026rsquo;re attacking.\nCONNOR: Okay. So I think this is what a dual sweep drive does. Okay.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s, um… I think it\u0026rsquo;s like what– on ships they call them, like azi– azimuthal motors or something? The idea being, right, you know, a standard skyship can go forward, backwards, or stop and stay kind of… parked and hovering in the– oh, and also up and down, right? They kind of go in those two ax– in that kind of one plane of travel, forward, backwards, up, down. And of course it can turn, right? Like, by pivoting its body, but it does have like a certain axis of thrust.\nAnd so I think the dual sweep drive modification allows the ship to strafe, right? Allows it to move perpendicular to its main axis of movement.\nYeah. What does that look like, though? Because, again, I think this ship kind of looks like a big bird, right? Um… up on the tail wings is where the bridge is, right, because it overlooks the flat of the bird\u0026rsquo;s back, and that\u0026rsquo;s where, like, the out deck– or the upper deck is, where parties used to be had. And you can see upon the wings. And, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s– up in the beak where, like, the battle stations are, where you get to do your sensors and your surveys and your, um, you know, attack plans. And I think, like, under the wings is where the main sweep engine or the sweep drives exist.\nAnd so I think the dual sweep engines go at the bow and at the aft of the ship, right? At the back, they… I think they kind of look like bird\u0026rsquo;s feet, but like bird\u0026rsquo;s feet when they\u0026rsquo;re like making little fists, you know? When they got something in their little hands? Or in their little feet? So it\u0026rsquo;s like little fists at the front– or, at the back.\nAnd at the front, I think it looks like, um… eyes, right? I think getting those installed makes them look kind of like eyes at the very front. And so this thing starts to take a bit more of that mechano-organic appearance as it has, um, engines for legs and engines for eyes.\nCALEB: That wasn\u0026rsquo;t even my event card! I love the captain\u0026rsquo;s prompts too much. [Laughing] Okay.\nCONNOR: I maybe got a little wrapped up in that first one there.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo \u0026amp; otherwise self-paced TTRPGs.

Today, we will be doing the same, but progressed one further… as is often the case with sequential numbers or a series of events.\nGAME: SECOND ERA (CONT\u0026rsquo;D) EVENT CALEB: Now I have to do my event card for the second era.\nSATAH: Now, draw a card and turn to the fire and flood prompt table.\nCONNOR: This is an event card. So I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a heart.\nSATAH: Drew a diamond.\nCALEB: Diamonds.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;If you draw a diamond or a heart, choose a prompt from\nALL: fire.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Struggle, strife, and treachery.\u0026rdquo; Ooh, okay.\nCALEB: Sorry for that long gap. I\u0026rsquo;m really thinking about these.\nCONNOR: And once more, it\u0026rsquo;s a table of six.\nSATAH: Rolling my d6.\nCONNOR: But you know what? I\u0026rsquo;m going to break from form and choose one.\nCALEB: I just set up such a good story for this captain, I\u0026rsquo;m, like, having trouble even wanting to do another one.\nCONNOR: And I\u0026rsquo;m choosing number four: \u0026ldquo;worth fighting for.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Six: \u0026ldquo;No friends in high places.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;No friends in high places. Someone your captain thought they could trust reveals a secret agenda.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Describe the confrontation.\nCALEB \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;What does this mean for you?\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: I think the captain has defeated this beast. Someone from the Empire came to inspect it, approved the use of the metal in replacing my metal parts, and exactly when I was finished– the moment I was finished– announced that they would be taking the ship back. Because finally accumulating enough of this metal to fix my design means that my speed is exponentially increased.\nMy power has been proven by this, and the captain, while she completed the job, did so after receiving a series of complaints from her crew for keeping them stuck out on the ocean for a long time, keeping them out in the sky, worried for their families, worried about their health, constantly hunting this thing.\nAnd of course, in the end, someone ratted her out for killing all of those people. The Empire had no choice but to take away her assignment, her position. At the end of this journey, she killed the beast, but she lost the ship. She lost her daughter. And she returned home in shame, as everyone know– knew what she had done to bait the trap.\nThis means I am returning, potentially, to the control of the empire, depending on what happens in era three, I suppose.\nSATAH: I was like, who could this captain trust?! Like, in high places, especially, the implication that this is someone in power. And then I thought, like, maybe there is a Navy or something that really should be taking care of this pirate problem… but hasn\u0026rsquo;t been. And they\u0026rsquo;ll claim it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;not their jurisdiction,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s nothing they can do.\u0026rdquo; But it is, and there is.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s like, the captain– The Vicious Corsair– is sleeping with the Admiral. You know? And is like, \u0026ldquo;This is better for both of us. The threat of me keeps the seas more clear. People who would take the risk of crossing this ocean if it were just the creatures and just the other threats… sometimes the added pressure of me and my crew is enough to keep them in shallower shores. That means less work for you to do. Less for you to keep track of.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd also… when I was thinking of, like– the ships they attack are often like desperate or important, one of the things I was thinking is that they probably are often, like, military ships and that kind of thing. And this means that the Corsair can sell weapons to the Navy, but also can make sure that if they attack Navy ships, they do so in a way that is, like… not as bad as if the Corsair weren\u0026rsquo;t slightly under their thumb. Or if enemies of the Navy come in, foreign militaries, whatever, they can, like, keep track of it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not picturing this as Earth, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have a solid image of what it is. I just know that it\u0026rsquo;s a big ocean. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s even not quite an ocean, but like a great lake. That\u0026rsquo;s part of it. It may as well be an ocean, but it is, like– there is a bigger world out there that is a little bit isolated, but can access it through, like, a big river or something. Not super important, but just thinking about like who has power in the sea. Like, what nation, who owns it, blah blah. You know. All that stuff. [Laughs]\nAnd then it turns out that… the Admiral has a secret agenda. What is it? It\u0026rsquo;s something like the Admiral has been waiting for the Corsair to step on the wrong toes or has been waiting for, like, a regulation bylaw to pass that allows them to basically impound me. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where like technically at any point, they could arrest these pirates, but the ship would still belong to the Corsair. It\u0026rsquo;s very hard to legally make a ship change hands or something like that. But a bill could pass or- or a line could be walked over that finally triggers like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, we can own this ship.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they try to do it. They try to just impound me, basically. And there\u0026rsquo;s like a vicious fight verbally between the Corsair and the Admiral. I think the Corsair kills the Admiral. And the main– the main sort of consequence of this for me is that we have to go somewhere very different. Like, we have to completely leave this area. This- this place that I\u0026rsquo;ve… the place that I\u0026rsquo;ve flown over for my entire existence so far, we have to leave it very far behind because now there\u0026rsquo;s nobody to protect this pirate crew. And they\u0026rsquo;re very, very, very much wanted. Not only can the ship– me– not only could they, the Navy, theoretically claim me, but also now they\u0026rsquo;ve killed– [Laughs] now they\u0026rsquo;ve killed a high ranking military official, so.\nWe leave, we go somewhere totally different. I think we\u0026rsquo;re like– we, like, fly over land for a long time and everyone\u0026rsquo;s trying to figure out what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do next, what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do next, and… it is not clear.\nCONNOR: So this prompt reads, \u0026ldquo;My captain has a choice. Stand idly by and risk nothing or fight back and save something precious. What do they look like as they decide? And do I, the ship, agree with their choice?\u0026rdquo;\nI think what has happened is Arteria\u0026rsquo;s change from hunting and killing to tracking and documenting has given her insight and knowledge of the Leviathan\u0026rsquo;s migration patterns and nests.\nAnd I- I think Leviathan nests have been something that have been hypothesized as- as existing, right? Um, but nobody was has ever been able to find one or see one. But Arteria has found out information on where these nests could be. And seeing as the hearts of these creatures are a necessity to create these skyships, there is a big economic importance to figuring out where these things live.\nAnd so it\u0026rsquo;s not even stand idly by and risk nothing– I think it is– it\u0026rsquo;s capitulate and be celebrated, but sell out. And I think, again, at first she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know.\nAnd I am a stealth ship, which means I am quiet and I am fast. So together, we chase the sun for weeks. We fly and we fly and we fly and there is never a moment where the wind isn\u0026rsquo;t ripping underneath my wings. I– there is not a moment where you could even begin to think to step out onto the open upper deck, because this air would be ripped from your lungs.\nWe fly like the devil is chasing us. And he may well just be.\nArteria can\u0026rsquo;t decide. And I wish she would because I\u0026rsquo;m getting tired. She has chased after her issues for a while, and now she is running from them, and… I am getting tired.\nIt is about halfway through the fourth week of running that we are finally caught. It\u0026rsquo;s been five years since we landed on the tree splitter. Five years of collecting data, of researching, of starting to understand what these Leviathans do, why they attack. Where did this conflict start from? And she\u0026rsquo;s so close.\nBut unfortunately, the clock has run out.\nShe has given me eyes so that I might see her… so that I might see her choice, and so that I might weep with her when she casts all her research overboard. When she destroys it.\nBecause I don\u0026rsquo;t think you can understand grief. I think it just is. [Choked up] And as she watches it scatter… in the wind… sink beneath the waves, she is hardened, and I think she has saved a lot of lives by finally letting it go. So, yeah, I agree with her. While I am so happy to be alive, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we need to kill. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be part of the killing just to make more of me.\nSo yeah. She\u0026rsquo;s destroyed her research and announced it to every vehicle that has been pursuing her. And I think she has made a pariah to mainstream society, but I think there\u0026rsquo;s a few who understand why she did it.\nAnd in learning to, again, live with nature, to live with these creatures and to not try and rage against them, found that balance that her destroyed village was so about.\nTIME PASSES SATAH: With that, I\u0026rsquo;m going to draw a card as time passes.\nCALEB: And now a time passes card.\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Draw a card and time passes and we find our way to the service of a new captain.\u0026rdquo; [Hard exhale] Jeepers. Okay, I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a heart, which means we are going to \u0026ldquo;This hull, our home.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Drew a diamond. \u0026ldquo;This hull, our home.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: Spades. \u0026ldquo;The way of all things\u0026rdquo; prompt. Okay.\nSATAH: I rolled a one…\nCONNOR: So I don\u0026rsquo;t have any D6s on me. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to use a D20 and I\u0026rsquo;ll do… D20 mod 6 and then ignore 19s or 20s. And… [Die rolling]\nCONNOR, OVERLAPPING IN A DREAMY STRESS MONTAGE: 13 mod 6 is 8. Mod 5. I\u0026rsquo;ll just divide by 3. One… two… three… four… 13 divided by 3 is… I wasn\u0026rsquo;t prepared to do math today.\nCONNOR: That\u0026rsquo;s a 5. \u0026ldquo;Mind you, she\u0026rsquo;s particular.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m so good at this math. We already had that one, so we can\u0026rsquo;t do that one. We\u0026rsquo;ve got to do it differently. [Die rolling again]\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Paint strips, boards groan, and rigging rots. Where is time taking the greatest toll on you?\u0026rdquo;\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s almost all in paint. The flowers within my gears no longer have their illustration on it. The green paint along the outside of the Greenblade has chipped and been removed.\nI am unloved by the world. I have done my job so well as to become nearly villainous. I quelled an uprising by killing all the other ships involved. I defeated a beast at the expense of the loss of hundreds of citizens. I was used as a smuggling ship and then as a ship of vengeance.\nPeople are frightened of me. Even my crew, I think, is frightened of me to an extent.\nAs a result, the Greenblade doesn\u0026rsquo;t get painted. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get polished. The Greenblade is sharpened. The Long Nines are cleaned. The electrified hull plating will always work. They monitor that, but they don\u0026rsquo;t touch anything they don\u0026rsquo;t have to. They don\u0026rsquo;t want it to curse them, maybe. So that is what is happening over time.\nCONNOR: A six is \u0026ldquo;songs against the tide.\u0026rdquo; Okay! Whew. We got there.\n\u0026ldquo;What motto or song…\u0026rdquo; Oh, gosh. Phew. \u0026ldquo;What motto or song always unites your crew when all looks lost, and who sings it to you for the last time?\u0026rdquo; [Lightly hysterical giggling]\nI am going to… crib heavily here from a very favourite and dear show of mine. And I\u0026rsquo;m sorry that I\u0026rsquo;m that insufferable guy who loves Adventure Time, but gosh, I love Adventure Time.\nI think this plays really well on the grief that Arteria has been dealing with. And I think the song or the motto is, um… \u0026ldquo;will happen. happening. happened.\u0026rdquo; And there we are, again and again, because you and I will always be back then.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s about, you know, everyone we\u0026rsquo;ve met, everyone we love, everyone we\u0026rsquo;ve hated, we\u0026rsquo;re all connected through time, right? And so those happiest moments are happening right now. Those highest of highs are happening.\nAnd when things are at their darkest, this moment too will pass, and everything is temporary, and everything is permanent. If you know how to look, you can see it all.\nIt is a cool spring day when I hear that song for the last time.\nI fly so infrequently now. Arteria has grown older and grown tired, but she has taken me out all on her own, and she sets me screaming into the sunset, and I fly like we did when we were running. And almost imperceptibly I race around the planet, so fast that the sun starts to rise.\nShe takes me down and we land on a beach and we watch the sunset as the waves crash into the shore and roll back out to sea.\nWill happen.\nHappening.\nHappened.\nCONNOR: Era two is a tough one!\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;There were good times here once. To commemorate a celebration on board, the crew left a bit of art or an inscription. What is it?\u0026rdquo;\nWhile we\u0026rsquo;re on the run, the Corsair has just been locked in their quarters, steaming and stewing, trying to figure out what the fuck they\u0026rsquo;re going to do next. There\u0026rsquo;s a hesitant knock on the door and they open it furiously.\nAnd the crew member is like, \u0026ldquo;We need you in the… we need you in the hold, um, C-Captain, if that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re super grumpy and they come and everyone\u0026rsquo;s nervous, but they– it\u0026rsquo;s a little surprise party for the Corsair\u0026rsquo;s birthday. They walk in and they see everyone there and like a single wrapped gift on a table and they freeze. And they\u0026rsquo;re just staring at the gift and someone says like, \u0026ldquo;In all the hurry, did you forget what day it is?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s silence for a long while, and then they go, \u0026ldquo;Oh my god. Oh my god, I did.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd someone lights a little candle on a cupcake or something and is like, \u0026ldquo;Happy birthday, Captain.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Corsair is silent still, and everyone\u0026rsquo;s getting increasingly nervous. And then they just burst out laughing and they command people to, like, open up the stores, the reserves. Let\u0026rsquo;s make this a fuckin\u0026rsquo; party. What are we doing? We\u0026rsquo;re pirates. We\u0026rsquo;re gonna be worried?! We\u0026rsquo;re gonna sit around and be scared?! No. How embarrassing that I forgot myself. [Laughs] Even for a moment. Even for a week. Let\u0026rsquo;s show them what we\u0026rsquo;re made of. Let\u0026rsquo;s show ourselves what we\u0026rsquo;re made of.\nAnd they throw a huge party celebrating the Corsair\u0026rsquo;s birthday, celebrating their freedom from their partnership with the Admiral, however tumultuous it was, however much it did benefit them it was ultimately still living by somebody else\u0026rsquo;s rules in some way.\nNever again.\nAnd I think somewhere inside… it\u0026rsquo;-s it\u0026rsquo;s in the parlor turned hold. My logo, The Catching Net– it\u0026rsquo;s painted on the back of the ship, as is often true of names, or the side or something. It\u0026rsquo;s also painted in here. A very, like, beautiful artistic version of it.\nAnd somebody paints underneath it. I was thinking \u0026ldquo;The Catching Net is free,\u0026rdquo; but I think what it actually is, is– \u0026ldquo;The Catching Net\u0026rdquo; and then someone paints– obviously a different hand, but a similar style, \u0026ldquo;Cannot be caught.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Catching Net cannot be caught.\nAnd that exists in this hold as part of this logo as they move forward and try to never compromise. Never again.\nGAME: THIRD ERA CALEB: Okay!\nCALEB: Okay!\nCONNOR: Boy. I went through a lot of big emotions last era.\nCALEB: Getting into the third era.\nCONNOR: I have got my cat on my lap and she\u0026rsquo;s decided now is the perfect time to start sowing her little fur all over the pop filter.\nSATAH: The third era is very comfortingly titled, \u0026ldquo;The World Moves On.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: We\u0026rsquo;re coming back into this totally brand new, fresh and… I mean, you know, we got our memories. We got our songs. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the captains of the third era.\nCAPTAIN SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Draw two cards to determine your captain.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: I\u0026rsquo;m drawing two different heart cards. So I have to draw one more with the hearts to figure out my captain… and it\u0026rsquo;s clubs. So it\u0026rsquo;s hearts and clubs.\nSATAH: A diamond and a club.\nCONNOR: We got ourselves a spade and a… diamond.\nSATAH: Sleek and powerful.\nCONNOR: Sleek from the spade and swift from the diamonds. Yes, I am looking at these suits correctly. That is exactly what these are.\nCALEB: My captain of the third era, which is called The World Moves On, is The Rebellious Firebrand.\nSATAH: The Rising Star.\nCONNOR: The Canny Smuggler.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You are the Rising Star\u0026rsquo;s first command under the new regime. They are eager to excel, inexperienced, and have the eyes of their superiors upon them.\u0026rdquo;\nOh– I missed– okay. I totally missed the thing of last era also said, \u0026ldquo;natural disaster prompts strife and turmoil among the world\u0026rsquo;s nations.\u0026rdquo; So this is sort of the overarching thing. What was the first one? \u0026ldquo;High adventure in a gilded era of exploration and discovery.\u0026rdquo; Okay. So first era, \u0026ldquo;high adventure in a gilded era of exploration and discovery.\u0026rdquo; What is the third era? \u0026ldquo;The coalition seizes control, expanding their power in the changed world.\u0026rdquo; Okay.\nThis book is gorgeous and and organized in a way that I find a little difficult to- to parse for finding information when I need it. Um– I see that, like– I– it\u0026rsquo;s good to have that information of, like, what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the bigger picture as I sort of, like, get my captain and stuff, rather than having it just at the end– just so that I have, like, an idea of what\u0026rsquo;s happening?\nBut in any case…\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;You and the Smuggler flaunt the new regime, eking out a living on the edges. They are daring, roguish, and perhaps half as clever as they believe themselves.\u0026rdquo; Oh, so me! No, I\u0026rsquo;m not daring and roguish. Um. [Laughs]\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;A unifying voice of dissent in the face of the new regime, you and the Firebrand are a symbol of a better world. They are stalwart, uncompromising, and so very tired. That\u0026rsquo;s interesting!! Okay, so.\nThe previous captain was stripped of their– y\u0026rsquo;know, their representative title as a member of their community under the Imperium\u0026rsquo;s gaze. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up back under Imperial control. Something happened during that exchange, after I was crafted, that led to me being taken.\n\u0026ldquo;A unifying voice of dissent.\u0026rdquo; I think it\u0026rsquo;s Colma. I think it\u0026rsquo;s now been another ten years. She\u0026rsquo;s in her thirties, and she found, at last, as a result of the previous captain\u0026rsquo;s actions, the opportunity to build me into her final specifications and then run away from the Empire, leave their service as an engineer by taking control of me for the first time– her first design– and becoming a rebellious leader for a new resistance that is perhaps going to be a little more careful than the one that I first doomed to defeat.\nAnd I have to admit, I\u0026rsquo;m a little excited about that because I\u0026rsquo;ve been piloted by a bunch of criminals and angry people and I\u0026rsquo;ve been used for vengeance and slaughter, so… the opportunity to maybe participate in something nice, something that slows down imperial control, while piloted by my very creator makes me feel good, even though I\u0026rsquo;m just a ship.\nCONNOR: I am thinking that the Smuggler\u0026rsquo;s name is going to be Hush. I think that is a name that they have given themselves.\nThey\u0026rsquo;ve got, uh, short silver hair and a scar on their cheek. And they like to say that the scar is from a bar fight gone bad, but in reality, it\u0026rsquo;s, uh– it comes from when they were younger and goofing around with their grandfather\u0026rsquo;s knife collection and trying to do some butterfly knife tricks. Y\u0026rsquo;know, they\u0026rsquo;d seen some of their friends do these tricks and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Aww, I really want to do those too!\u0026rdquo; And the very first thing they did was cut their cheek. And- and immediately learned proper knife safety. You know, knife safety is very important. Cut towards your chum, not your tum.\nAnd I think they also, like– they wear a vest, kind of like a fishing vest, with, like, a bunch of pockets. Like, way more pockets than is necessary on a vest, but only they know what\u0026rsquo;s in each one. You know, there\u0026rsquo;s– it\u0026rsquo;s always something, like, kind of handy or some interesting bobble or something that they can use to make a quick escape. And some of them are trapped for pickpockets.\nI think Hush has a certain distrust for people. I think they\u0026rsquo;re very– they\u0026rsquo;re very wary of anyone outside of their circle. But once you are in Hush\u0026rsquo;s circle, there is an immense amount of trust placed with you.\nFIRST REFIT CALEB: So let\u0026rsquo;s see if I get a refit. [Skipping like a record] R-r–r-refit. Hearts again! Ha ha ha ha! What do I get? What do I get? What do I get? \u0026ldquo;Reactive plating.\u0026rdquo; So I have electrified hull plating and now I have reactive plating.\nSATAH: And first draw a card for the chance of refit and I got a club, so ye,s absolutely! Let\u0026rsquo;s see. Clubs are powerful and the refit is a munitions auto loader.\nCALEB: Okay, here\u0026rsquo;s something fun. Colma designed metal plates that resonate on the frequency of the radios– magical or not– the radios used by the Empire. Kind of like a– those, like, machines people have in their cars let them know if a cop is nearby? I have plates that, uh, vibrate and create a humming noise when we are being approached by an Empire ship.\nAnd… I think that\u0026rsquo;s enough. I think nobody else has the ability to track them like this or sense them like this as they move through the sky, and so she\u0026rsquo;s able to stay out of trouble and stay out of sight by moving anytime she hears the hum.\nGreat job, Colma.\nCONNOR: I drew a club. So no refit, no initial refit.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if this is the bounty sort of coming to bear of like… we were in the crosshairs of the Navy. Um, to have the ship claimed by them. I think that\u0026rsquo;s probably what happened.\nAnd is this the new Admiral? I think it probably is. Yeah. It took some time for them to figure out who was going to take over. But this is… this is… the Admiral who the Corsair killed, their replacement. Somewhat symbolically on purpose. Like the Navy is like, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re replacing the Admiral they killed. You need to get that ship back.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd part of what happens here I think is just that the coalition involves like… the Corsair was on the run, far away, trying to outrun the Navy by going into territories that the Navy had no jurisdiction in. And eventually, the jurisdiction was expanding faster than the Corsair could run. And this Rising Star, this new Admiral, takes the ship.\nAnd because it\u0026rsquo;s a Navy ship now, they need the weapons to be more effective. So she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to go out of her way to get this munitions autoloader that she\u0026rsquo;s adding because it\u0026rsquo;s provided to her by… the Navy.\nCAPTAIN\u0026rsquo;S PROMPTS CALEB: Captain\u0026rsquo;s prompts. \u0026ldquo;What event pushed the Firebrand into open rebellion? Describe the freedoms the Fireband and their ragtag band of true believers fight for.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;What was the one place where you–\u0026rdquo; me, the ship– \u0026ldquo;and the Smuggler felt safest? And why could you never stay for long?\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;How did the Rising Star\u0026rsquo;s first tour of their new command proceed? How is it not what they expected?\u0026rdquo;\nImmediately when I think of how it wasn\u0026rsquo;t what they expected, I think it\u0026rsquo;s that they were sent to get this ship symbolically, right? And I think the first tour goes incredibly. Without a hitch. It\u0026rsquo;s perfect. Weirdly perfect.\nAnd I think this admiral is starting to realise– it\u0026rsquo;s dawning on her– a lot of her work is going to be symbolic. She thought she was going to be coming in and… doing military tactics and really taking command and doing that kind of thing.\nAnd people above her– you have to imagine that the admiral who was making deals with pirates, even if it was ultimately to benefit the Navy, you have to imagine that they were doing a lot of stuff that wasn\u0026rsquo;t strictly what they were told to do, right? And so I think their death was used as an opportunity to take a lot of power away from the role, make it a little bit more of a figurehead.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s slowly dawning on the new admiral that she was put in this position not because of her merits– which are impressive, to be clear– but because she makes it look good, and right now, they\u0026rsquo;ve decided that that is more important and that that is going to be her role.\nAnd so… I think that she at least tries to take advantage of that by… it feels worse for her to pretend at military victory than it does to do things like bringing food to people, and so she tries to angle for a lot of work on her first tour that is, like, the navy comes in with supplies. And she gives a big speech in this town that is now under her protection, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t under her protection two months ago– that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been even if, you know, she had the job, um…\nAnd I think this- this game really wants to play with the big time scales, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s– it was years. The Corsair and the pirates actually managed to stay gone for… decades, actually.\nAnd so she isn\u0026rsquo;t the first new admiral. But I think the other admirals kept falling to the same flaw, right? They kept– they still had the power and so they were still making their own deals. And she is the first admiral in the new version of the role that is much more of a face.\nAnd this makes her uneasy, but… also, like… she\u0026rsquo;s flying. I imagine that skyships are much more common now than they were when I was first created and so– and she\u0026rsquo;s young enough, this new admiral is young enough that she was– she actually grew up knowing skyships and knowing, like– wanting to fly one of those one day. And chased, like– went into the military, went to the Navy, because she thought that was the best way to achieve the goal.\nAnd she tries to just get comfort in the idea that, like, it worked! She is… doing the thing that she set out to do, basically. The core of it… is there. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not everything. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not super fulfilling, because she isn\u0026rsquo;t getting to do some of the other stuff. But she\u0026rsquo;s trying to– she\u0026rsquo;s trying to be positive. She\u0026rsquo;s trying to– she\u0026rsquo;s trying to believe that it can be good. It can work.\nCONNOR: I\u0026rsquo;m going to first commit to the thing I started at the at the beginning of this recording session, which was, I\u0026rsquo;m giving my ship a slightly different name with every era. Um, and I think Hush– given that they- they flaunt the new regime, right? They\u0026rsquo;re, uh– they\u0026rsquo;re very anti-rules. I think the lineage of the name from King Sapphire to the Stalking Sapphire is a little too hoity-toity for them. And so they have taken to calling me just Saffy. I have gone from the King Sapphire to the Stalking Sapphire to just Saffy.\nAnd I think this is symbolic of Hush\u0026rsquo;s approach. You know, they run a very, um… you know, it\u0026rsquo;s risky being a smuggler, right? Like, if you get caught, things go poorly. But there is a certain admirable lightheartedness that they take to this smuggling, right? There is– it\u0026rsquo;s a thrill. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s almost like a game to them\nAnd so, yeah, as a result, I think there\u0026rsquo;s a… \u0026ldquo;uh-oh, we\u0026rsquo;re never going to make it through the blockade! The… the government has put up far too many interceptor ships!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think there\u0026rsquo;s always, like, a moment of glibness where Hush will, like, rub and kind of like pat the controls of– pat my controls and– you know, just kind of with a wry smile– and say, \u0026ldquo;They have no idea how fast old Saffy is here,\u0026rdquo; and then they would hit it, and I would go screaming, yeah.\nEver since Hush found me on that beach, I think it\u0026rsquo;s, uh– we\u0026rsquo;ve become very fast friends.\nCALEB: Well, I think the event that pushed the Firebrand into open rebellion was building for a long time. She was kept under lock and key, a genius found at an empirical– empirical.– imperial school when she was younger and over time, forced to watch her creations go on to only further the control of the Empire.\nI think the seeds for this were planted all the way back in my first battle, when I was the only survivor. She saw how strong her designs were, and over the time since then, she made specialised ships, but she never made any that were all around as good as me again. She made a point not to. She didn\u0026rsquo;t want to improve.\nAnd when the time came that it just so happened that I was sent to be repaired at the shop she was being placed at at the time, and that the Leviathan had been killed, and she saw the opportunity to turn me into the perfect ship… she fled. And decided that was the sign she needed.\nShe has now found some surviving members of her village. I think her parents are gone. A lot of her family is gone, but some people from her original village, some other kids have joined her in this. She occasionally accrues more people who are fighting back against the empire.\nAnd I think the main thing they\u0026rsquo;re pushing for is that this empire… it benefits the emperor. It benefits the centralised power structure to have, basically, a police state. The people are monitored more than they\u0026rsquo;re protected, and the Firebrand, Colma, really wishes for her ships to stop being used to police her own country and her own people and to make sure that the empire remains, no matter what, and wishes they could be used for… exploration, for assisting those in need more often.\nAnd maybe she\u0026rsquo;s worried that they\u0026rsquo;re developing something much more serious. A ship that can carry something really bad, like a bomb.\nCONNOR: Where did we feel the safest? I think that\u0026rsquo;s where we should start first.\nI\u0026rsquo;m envisioning right now like a flat-topped mesa that is just perfect for parking a skyship on. And I\u0026rsquo;m imagining it surrounded by rolling dunes of sand. Maybe not like… total desert? Like, I think it\u0026rsquo;s still populated– populous. But I- I think the idea that having a high vantage point where Hush could see all around them really made them feel safe, you know? It\u0026rsquo;s like, you\u0026rsquo;re– you know, you\u0026rsquo;re never cornered if you have a skyship, right? You\u0026rsquo;re- you can always go up.\nUm, and I think there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of community here too, right? I- I think in the shadow of the mesa is a small town. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s where Hush is from, but I think it is where Hush feels most at home.\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s maybe a, um… ooh, I think there\u0026rsquo;s maybe a Robin Hood angle here, right? Where a good portion of whatever profits that Hush earns, they give back to this town. They have– they have really got a found family here. They love to bring back rare and exotic books for the town\u0026rsquo;s local library. You know, strange and flavorful ingredients that they have taken an opportunity to sample from all corners of the world and they- they bring it back to this- this town, and in this town, like– and in this way, it kind of becomes a, um– a mosaic of cultures, right? Like it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s like a- a nexus of all these various pieces of the world coming together in one spot.\nAnd I- I think it is because Hush loves this town so much that it starts to flourish.\nIt starts to become a bit of a trade hub of sorts, which attracts outsiders to the town. And while Hush knows that nobody in the town would ever sell them out, they\u0026rsquo;re less certain about the outsiders, so I think it is for that reason that Hush and I can never stay long in this town and I– you know, I\u0026rsquo;m going to give the town a name. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be bold and give the town a name.\nIt is a town, I said, in the shadow of a mesa in the desert… Shadowside. Yeah, Shadowside is the name of the town. Ten out of ten world building right there. Tolkien ain\u0026rsquo;t got nothing on me. Um, yes, that\u0026rsquo;s right; the town on the shadow side of the mesa is called Shadowside. Get in the c– [Laughing] get in the comments.\nHush and I, we don\u0026rsquo;t stay there long because Hush is worried about being recognised. Right? They\u0026rsquo;ve brokered not a lot of super legal deals. And the worst case scenario for them would be to have someone recognise them and then hurt this town that they have come to love and has come to love them.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Tell the story of the most desperate mission you and the Firebrand ever undertook.\u0026rdquo; Hooo.\nI\u0026rsquo;m thinking, honestly, that last thing I just said sounds awesome. That the Empire developed a bomb. And Colma realised that the bomb was being carried on a ship to be used against a city that had been attempting to separate itself from the Empire and was speaking out against the Emperor and his control, and as a result, we had a mission to attempt to take down the ship before it could reach the people of that town.\nBut if you destroyed the ship and you sent it hurling toward the ground, it was going to blow up this big bomb it was carrying and was going to cause significant damage to someone. And so we had a very, very tiny window of where we could intercept the ship, take it down, hopefully, with the Long Nines and minimise the damage to the world.\nBut it required us to be pretty close, required us to time it exactly right, and… they were evacuated, but the best place to drop the bomb was on Colma\u0026rsquo;s hometown. The original hometown that she was taken from and that was kind of already scattered to the winds because of the Empire\u0026rsquo;s retaliation against her parents\u0026rsquo; attacks. And so Colma\u0026rsquo;s only choice was to destroy her hometown to protect a much larger city.\nIt was desperate. It was difficult. And it required perfect timing of the Long Nines, which… I actually think that there\u0026rsquo;s a gunner who persisted here. Someone who was rebelling, who joined from previous practice, who\u0026rsquo;s getting old now.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What difficult mission did you and the Rising Star undertake together that made both of your reputations?\u0026rdquo; Ooh… open- open question.\nI think- I think I\u0026rsquo;ll build off of, like, what I said of, uh… she starts trying to do a lot of bringing supplies to people and that kind of thing. And I think that, like, slowly she realises how much she loves that. She likes helping people. She\u0026rsquo;s- she\u0026rsquo;s nice. [Laughs] She\u0026rsquo;s a good person.\nAnd… she does want to be able to exercise her tactical abilities and so I th– that- that is something that she\u0026rsquo;s missing. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a conflict for her where she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Wait, I really love helping people, but, like I\u0026rsquo;ve studied tactics, and how do you… how do you help people tactically?\u0026rdquo;\n[Laughs] There are a lot of ways, but she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know them yet.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s starting to learn them, though, because I think that– what this is is like, there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a big military action and there\u0026rsquo;s a town in the very middle of it that isn\u0026rsquo;t involved. Two sides fighting surrounding them and they\u0026rsquo;re right in the middle. Some weird just quirk of borders and landmarks.\nAnd this big mission that really skyrockets our reputation is that she figures out how to get supplies to them. She goes into the middle of this war between two sides– neither of whom are hers, I think is the thing. This is, like, three factions. The Coalition\u0026rsquo;s people are the ones in the middle and these other two, not sure who they are, but she can\u0026rsquo;t rely on either of them to just let her through.\nAnd she manages to get through the fighting and… find– like, if we go this far up then we\u0026rsquo;re, you know, in a no man\u0026rsquo;s land and then we can come down here. Um, and then we have to like go around this mountain. And it is this big difficult, like– people have to be maneuvered and arranged and she does it. And manages to get supplies to these people without, I think– like, one of the reasons that she\u0026rsquo;s allowed to do this by her superiors is that, like… if it came down to it they\u0026rsquo;d have to try and intervene probably? And like this makes it so they don\u0026rsquo;t have to and they can just let these other two warring factions battle each other out.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s probably what it is. They\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;We want them to keep fighting and then we\u0026rsquo;ll come in when they\u0026rsquo;re vulnerable.\u0026rdquo; Mm! Sounds like the pirates. Interesting. [Laughs]\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re willing– ooh, yeah. She is allowed to do it, but, like, they\u0026rsquo;re willing to just let that town in the middle be sacrificed. And she isn\u0026rsquo;t. And they let her do it because it does look good. It looks really good for the Navy to not… Air Navy. Uh. Yeah, weird combination between the Air Force and the Navy now, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep with the Navy, whatever.\nIt looks great for them to not let these people die. They were willing to, and it would have been… they would have had a great case to say they had no choice. But she\u0026rsquo;s decided that they did.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s a big deal, the idea that someone would… put all of that thought and that effort into saving this one little town, this small group of people, relatively small group of people, is a really big deal.\nAnd the image of The Catching Net carefully appearing around this mountain range is painted, is described in song, is… just becomes this historical epic of this image. And people think of that when they see me. They think of the care, of going out of the way to protect the most vulnerable.\nAnd the Admiral has a little bit of conflict with this because she\u0026rsquo;s really aware that the people in power would have just let them die. And so it\u0026rsquo;s a little– feels a little odd to her that they get to look better when they didn\u0026rsquo;t even want her to do it, when she had to kind of fight to do it. Yeah.\nCONNOR: So now we get to \u0026ldquo;what memorable cargo was more trouble than it was worth?\u0026rdquo; I think this answers the question as to why would anyone want to hurt Hush?\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the thing. I hear new regime, and I think… hard, iron fist, cruel and uncaring, and I think something that needs to be resisted.\nI think we maybe saw the sprouting of that weed in the previous era, especially at the end with trying to turn what is a… you know, it\u0026rsquo;s like the difference from, like, fishing with a fishing rod versus fishing with, like, a gigantic net, right? Like, turning it into an industry. I think we started to see that grab for power at the end of the last era. And I think, you know, again, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to be specific on timelines here, but I think this third era has come quite quickly on the heels of the second. I think these weeds have taken root. And they are a lot more in control.\nAnd so, I th… you know– \u0026ldquo;is it hack to have a throughline in your stories?\u0026rdquo; I wonder aloud as I start to believe that it\u0026rsquo;s not hack to have a throughline in your stories.\nAnd I think that Captain Arteria, while she did destroy her research and while she did destroy her transponder that would read these tracking signals on these, um– of the Leviations, I think that the most memorable cargo that was more trouble than it was worth was some prototype being used by underground naturalists. Some– sorry, some prototype of a radio or transponder that lays the groundwork for collecting the signals from Arteria\u0026rsquo;s tracking devices.\nI think it– yeah. It was being smuggled out of a government lab because one of the developers knows what this will be used for, right? They know this device will be used to kind of perpetuate a war on a species that maybe doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what war is. And so… I think they burn the research and smuggle out the one prototype to their contacts.\nOh, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to come up with a good underground eco-group name. I think maybe the name of this preservation group is called the Lotus Dancers. Yeah, they\u0026rsquo;re the ones receiving this tracking device. And they\u0026rsquo;re so-called, right, because they dance b– the idea is that they dance delicately upon the leaves of the lotus as it floats in the water. Do lotuses float in water? [Typing] Yes, they do. Yeah, so they dance delicately upon the leaves of the lotus, not disturbing the plant, not causing it to sink, while still allowing themselves to thrive and live upon the surface of the flower.\nSo yes, yeah, Hush was smuggling, um, this- this prototype signal collecting device, um, that is able to be tuned in… it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s almost like a cryptography thing, right? I think it\u0026rsquo;s, like– they\u0026rsquo;re trying to figure out what the key is to deciphering all of these encrypted trackers, uh, that Arteria had, uh, had sown amongst the, uh, amongst the Leviathans. And so they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re using this– they\u0026rsquo;re going to want to use this then, um, to track, uh, these Leviathans and kind of correlate that to where government ships are so that if there is a need to run a smoke screen operation, uh, to prevent them from finding a potential nest, um… they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re using this to kind of stay one step ahead.\nUm, and so this was- this is the memorable cargo, right? Like the- the fate of a, um- of a- of a species made it, while it was small, one of the heaviest cargoes I have ever carried.\nAnd what made it more trouble than it was worth, I think this brings us right back around to the start here. I think this ship was IDed. Or maybe not identified, but maybe captured on photograph or on camera somehow, right? Someone got a good look at this ship and has an idea of who the connection is– to where this power source, this domination of the skies, can be found.\nAnd so it has turned myself and Hush from a relatively small-time smuggling operation where we have been keeping ourselves on the edges and out of sight. We put a toe into the spotlight, and now are being hunted. Not quite a– not a super active hunt, mind you. I am incredibly fast and incredibly stealthy. But, you know, it has really built that distrust of anyone outside of Hush\u0026rsquo;s inner circle.\nSECOND REFIT CALEB: And then I roll for another potential refit.\nSATAH: Draw a card for a second chance of refit.\nCONNOR: Um, heart, which is not one of my… symbols, so I don\u0026rsquo;t get a potential refit.\nSATAH: A diamond! So it does match one of the captain\u0026rsquo;s tags. It is sleek. \u0026ldquo;Sky brass lightning sinks.\u0026rdquo; Ooh!\nCALEB: Clubs… oh, that is another refit again! The \u0026ldquo;stolen coalition repeater.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s a really appropriate sound– like, sounding name.\nI mean, repeater… coalition repeater… I think it\u0026rsquo;s cool machine guns on either side of the boat. Like, pellet firing guns that– I think the word coalition is because they require multiple people to be operating them somehow? Like, maybe they\u0026rsquo;re having to load these pellets live while they\u0026rsquo;re fired. We don\u0026rsquo;t have, like, magazines, and so it\u0026rsquo;s like one person is aiming, one person is firing, and one person is pouring pellets into a funnel at the end of this machine gun. And so having both of them active requires like six people functioning at once. Very much a group activity. If any of those people are not doing their jobs well, also, the- the repeater can be knocking us off balance pretty dramatically. So even the pilot needs to be understanding of what\u0026rsquo;s happening and be on board.\nA total, shredding, incredible firearm that requires everybody on board to be on the same page about what they\u0026rsquo;re doing to use it.\nSATAH: I think what makes this refit special is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come from the Navy. It comes from one of the towns that she sort of patrols and provides supplies to.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s like a– there\u0026rsquo;s a little group of traders that come to her and they\u0026rsquo;re looking at her sails. She\u0026rsquo;s getting the sails repaired. They\u0026rsquo;re charred. And these traders come to her and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Hey… do you want to know how we maintain our sails for longer?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd her eyebrows go up and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Sure. I was under the impression that wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they all kind of, like, smirk at each other. And they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah. Up front, it\u0026rsquo;s cheaper to keep repairing the sails. But over the course of a ship\u0026rsquo;s life, it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense. And it\u0026rsquo;s not good for the wood either.\n\u0026ldquo;You can install lightning sinks and it catches more of the electricity from the storms and it means that your sails will last longer, the wood doesn\u0026rsquo;t suffer as much heat damage,\u0026rdquo;\nwhatever, whatever. \u0026ldquo;And we even think that at some point there might be a way to store it, but we don\u0026rsquo;t know. Imagine. Imagine if you could use lightning to power your ship.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs]\nOoh! That\u0026rsquo;s another thing that the Navy is scared of. Um– because they say that, and then I think there\u0026rsquo;s almost, like– they\u0026rsquo;re getting excited, the traders. They\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Imagine– we think that in the future you might be able to use the power of lightning, to store it and power these engines,\u0026rdquo; and then they stop talking like they\u0026rsquo;ve said too much.\nAnd the Admiral\u0026rsquo;s eyebrows sort of, like– her eyebrows already went up in this conversation. Let\u0026rsquo;s leave the eyebrows alone.\nShe looks between all of them, and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Well, then we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t… I suppose that our trading partners who provide us fuel would, uh… be a little frustrated with that.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the traders, like, nod a little bit, like noncommittally.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Hmm, well, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want that. But we\u0026rsquo;re not there yet, are we? So, seems like a sound investment to me.\u0026rdquo; And with this is signaling to the people like, oh, I get it. The Navy doesn\u0026rsquo;t want these– this technology, these lightning sinks, like doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to support them because they could lead to electricity and then we\u0026rsquo;d stop buying coal. And the Navy has agreements with the coal miners\u0026rsquo; guild. You know? Um, and she\u0026rsquo;s saying, like, fuck them, that sounds great. We know that coal mining is bad and sucks for the people who did it– who do it. So yes, I will support this technology. And if it leads to the destruction of coal mines, then good.\nBut this is all unsaid. This is- this is just your- your classic Ancillary Justice conversation through implication over tea.\nAnd she pays the traders a hefty sum to install these skybrass lightning sinks on The Catching Net.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo \u0026amp; otherwise self-paced TTRPGs.

If you draw a diamond or heart, choose a prompt from \u0026lsquo;The World Moves\u0026rsquo;. If you draw a club or a spade, choose a prompt from \u0026lsquo;No, You Move.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; [Chuckles]\nAnd I drew a club.\nCONNOR: A heart.\nCALEB: The nine of spades. \u0026ldquo;No, You Move.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a d6… [Die rolling] The subtitles of these tables are \u0026ldquo;The Coalition pushes further\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;you push right back.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: So I guess, like, the Coalition is the regime, right? Yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s say it- it is– we\u0026rsquo;re getting cracked down, right?\nCALEB: Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m seeing that Coalition is the name of a faction in this era. That\u0026rsquo;s fine. I don\u0026rsquo;t need that.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;No, You Move\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;and you push right back.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: I honestly answered several of these with the story I just told, but I want to mix it up. So I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of a different one I can say that adds more. How about–\nSATAH: I rolled a four, which is. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll get ourselves a little further.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll get ourselves a little further.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;The arm of the Coalition extends and you are forced to the raggedy edge.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What kind of jobs and shady characters keep you and your crew flying?\u0026rdquo; Okay, so I was clearly supposed to be outside of the Coalition, but was assuming that I was part of it. My bad.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s perfect because I think we have seen glimpses in this Admiral\u0026rsquo;s story so far of her pulling further and further away from the establishment, right? Realising that she\u0026rsquo;s just for show. That the people above her consider helping people to only be worth it when it sends a good message and not for its own reasons of helping people. That they\u0026rsquo;re happy to suppress the development of technology that would disrupt labour industries that harm people just because they have financial agreements with those industries.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s years and years, right? It\u0026rsquo;s a long career. And I think the beginning of the answer to this prompt, when it says \u0026ldquo;the arm of the Coalition extends and you are forced to the raggedy edge,\u0026rdquo; is that she sees the tide turning. She feels the leash being tugged. The people above her are starting to get that the whole reason that her position was reworked was that so she didn\u0026rsquo;t have as much power. And they\u0026rsquo;re starting to notice that she\u0026rsquo;s doing what she wants a lot of the time. [Laughs]\nAnd she is doing her best, constantly coming up with excuses to be further away, to keep helping people on the edges. And at a certain point, she receives a direct order and she refuses it. And a warrant is put out for her arrest, but unfortunately for them, The Catching Net cannot be caught.\nAnd the Admiral has made it her entire life\u0026rsquo;s work to help people who otherwise would be ignored by these systems. And so they\u0026rsquo;re not fucking giving her up, you know? And she and her crew who are still very- who are loyal, you know? She\u0026rsquo;s– she, over her career, definitely had to, like, handpick her crew and- and- and has a very loyal contingent of people who feel the same way as her about the system and about their place in it and how they can turn their place into it into the best version. The version that feels best, that involves the least compromise.\nAnother thing they have in common with the pirates. No more compromise. [Chuckles]\nAnd… she\u0026rsquo;s on the run! She\u0026rsquo;s on the run as well.\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of jobs and shady characters keep you and your crew flying?\u0026rdquo; They are shady; they\u0026rsquo;re criminals. And they\u0026rsquo;re good people. [Laughs] By necessity, now, overnight, she became a criminal. Her behaviour didn\u0026rsquo;t change. Not really. But the way that it was regarded did, and therefore, so did the way that the behaviour of people around her is regarded. Suddenly, everybody who helps her is a criminal. Oops. [Laughs]\nAnd I think when it comes to \u0026ldquo;what kind of jobs,\u0026rdquo; just like… they keep doing the same thing. They\u0026rsquo;re still helping people. It\u0026rsquo;s harder. They have to start doing more trading and that kind of thing. But overall, like… people want to help them because they\u0026rsquo;ve been helping for… decades, I think, probably. At least a decade. Probably two.\nSo they\u0026rsquo;re just– they\u0026rsquo;re in the wind. Supplies to and from places. Running from the Navy. Waiting, hoping that it will collapse under its own weight. Feeling unnerved that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Because surely something that is built on something as, uh… unstable as selfishness and profit has to fall, right? But… sometimes it can get very, very tall before it does that.\nCALEB: So I think the Empire, following our destruction of their bomb, really cracks down and starts hunting for us. And we\u0026rsquo;re constantly on the run, hearing the hum of my reactive plating and having to flee from town to town.\nAnd I think what happens is we end up back in contact with Admiral Glavik from the First Era twenty years prior. Now she\u0026rsquo;s in her seventies. And Admiral Glavik, in her seventies, has gone full underground criminal. The Empire eventually kicked her out. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to be an admiral anymore. She got too old and she was unhappy with the way that they were treating people, anyway.\nOf course, Admiral Glavik– not so much of a rebellion person herself. She\u0026rsquo;s still in it for herself. She\u0026rsquo;s still out there trying to make money for herself. But Colma realizes that we have a lot to learn from her, and by offering Admiral Glavik our assistance in some smuggling runs that she\u0026rsquo;s doing with people outside of the Empire and within the Empire itself, she began to give us guidance on the actual military strategy of the Empire. Where they go. What they\u0026rsquo;re up to. How they will react. And her years and years of service working undercover within them means that she has a ton of information on the way they comport themselves, how they will behave… and her and her crew of smugglers, her extended family and her crew from before, who– many of whom left with her, they guide us toward the right targets, the right safe spaces.\nAnd in exchange, you know, we bring them back something nice every once in a while.\nCONNOR: There\u0026rsquo;s a couple of these that maybe speak to me, but nothing that hit me quite so profoundly as last time. So I am just going to roll a die, and let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens here. I\u0026rsquo;ll re-roll on 19s and 20s.\n[Die rolling] Six. Ooh. \u0026ldquo;Seizure and impound. The Coalition seizes control of you and places me in an impound in some backwater. For what purpose am I seized, and what must my Captain do to reclaim you?\u0026rdquo; Okay. Hmm.\nI think I need to play into the fact that Hush maybe isn\u0026rsquo;t as clever as they think they are. Um…\nSo I like that it was placed in an impound in some backwater, but I think it was also impounded in that backwater, right? It\u0026rsquo;s not like the ship was captured in some main city and then impounded in this backwater. I think it was found nearby and impounded in this backwater.\nAnd I think Hush… forgot to pay a docking fee. Yeah, I- I think, like– I think it\u0026rsquo;s a, you know– it is a simple mistake that has created a… intense situation. This is a– this is a backwater town. They don\u0026rsquo;t have a direct connection to the Coalition. Or they don\u0026rsquo;t have an incredibly active connection to the Coalition. They are connected, mind you. They are– you know, everyone\u0026rsquo;s part of the Coalition now, and everyone has to report and adhere to certain governmental structures. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think they have a Coalition agent or a Coalition terminal on site yet that connects them to the central network on Coalition ship registries. I think they\u0026rsquo;re still transitioning from a paper and pencil era into a, uh, maybe more of this, uh– maybe more of a digital age.\nAnd I think that is the saving grace and the timer which Hush is working against. Because Hush knows that if this ship is reported as having been impounded to the Coalition, they are going to swarm on this place and they are going to swarm on them/\nSo, yeah, I was seized for a parking tic– [Dissolving into laughter then recovering] for what is effectively a parking ticket.\nAnd how does Hush get me back?\nI think Hush has to do something that they are not very comfortable doing, which is trust a stranger. So often– I think they very much view trust as a thing that is a little transactional. That they will only give trust once they have been… once it has been earned, right? And, you know, we love to say trust is never freely given and it is earned, but I think in moments of dire need, they need to learn to trust somebody that they do not know well.\nSo. Yes. Hush– I think they\u0026rsquo;re having a bit of a dalliance with someone who lived in this town. And so, yeah, they\u0026rsquo;re doing that whole first weekend in bed sort of deal, right? Where you\u0026rsquo;re staying up late, you\u0026rsquo;re watching X-Files, and then you wake up really late in the morning and you have, like, a breakfast in bed as you watch the sunlight slowly filter in through the… the, like, half open window.\nAnd Hush goes to go back to their ship to fly off on another smuggling run when they see that it has been impounded. It is not where they had parked it. And so they have to go back to this person that they were seeing. Let\u0026rsquo;s give them a name. Her name is Veronica.\nI think Veronica has somebody who works in… bylaw? Yeah. Works in the bylaw office, right? Whoever\u0026rsquo;s in charge of enforcing docking violations and unpaid fees. Yeah, in the docking office, sorry; not in bylaw, in the docking office. Veronica has a friend who works in the docking office. And so not only is Hush having to learn how to trust this individual, who they\u0026rsquo;ve really only known for a weekend, but they\u0026rsquo;re going to have to learn to trust this individual\u0026rsquo;s friend.\nAnd, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go for something a little mundane here. We talked about exciting things before, but I think there can be excitement in the mundane as well.\nI think Hush has to go out to a party that Veronica\u0026rsquo;s friend is throwing to go and meet them and try to convince them to help Hush get their ship back.\nHonestly, resonating with me right now– like, the scariest thing someone could ask me to do right now is go to a party where I don\u0026rsquo;t know anyone and I barely know the person who has invited me along.\nBut I think there\u0026rsquo;s something exciting about that too. And I think Hush sees that excitement. I think they\u0026rsquo;re– again, it\u0026rsquo;s this push and pull of trying to be vulnerable with people so that they can win them over. And I mean, I know vulnerability isn\u0026rsquo;t always the most attractive– isn\u0026rsquo;t always the most attractive quality. Not that vulnerability isn\u0026rsquo;t attractive– but you know, it\u0026rsquo;s scary to open up to strangers, and… I feel like Hush stammers a lot through their words, kind of like how I\u0026rsquo;m stammering a lot through my words.\nI think they\u0026rsquo;re really trying to– whereas normally they take a very slow burn approach, they\u0026rsquo;re really trying to expedite the process, because they need to get their ship back yesterday. And so there\u0026rsquo;s like a lot of like a, um… I think there\u0026rsquo;s a scene where– [Laughs] they\u0026rsquo;re at the party and they\u0026rsquo;re talking and, you know, they\u0026rsquo;re each enjoying some canapes, right? Because it\u0026rsquo;s the party where they have little finger sandwiches. And they\u0026rsquo;re very nervously, like, through, like– with a cheek full of, like, cucumber sandwich, they\u0026rsquo;re saying, \u0026ldquo;Haha, yeah, this cut. I, uh– my grandfather\u0026rsquo;s knives? Um– I used them on my… back by accident… on my face?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd everyone\u0026rsquo;s just kind of, like, staring at Hush, like, wide-eyed. And Veronica\u0026rsquo;s, like, you know, laughing and being like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re… you\u0026rsquo;re so funny. What a funny story, right?\u0026rdquo; As they\u0026rsquo;re trying, like, very hard to be genuine, right?\nBut ultimately, I think they do manage to get a bit of one-on-one time with Veronica\u0026rsquo;s friend, Mike, who works in the impound dock.\nNow, Mike and Hush spend some time– again, awkwardly at first, just kind of out on the deck, looking up at the sky.\nAnd I think… I know where I want to go with this, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to get there. Right? Um…\nSo I think… yeah. I think it starts off with Mike saying that Veronica has been, you know, going on and on about how she feels so lucky to have met them. And I think this is disarming for Hush because they\u0026rsquo;re, you know, looking at this as a kind of a fling that, you know, maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll never come back to. Again, like, that– they\u0026rsquo;re not looking to build a trust network with somebody.\nAnd I think maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a moment of realisation that this trust that they\u0026rsquo;re so scared about other people breaking… in doing so, in being so reticent to give trust, they themselves may be breaking other people\u0026rsquo;s trust. And so in this moment, I think Hush realises, you know, that they are so lucky to have met Veronica.\nAnd I think they have like a bit of… hmm. I think they feel icky when they say this. Because I\u0026rsquo;m feeling icky about it right now, too. But I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a– you know, \u0026ldquo;I am so lucky that I have met somebody who is going to be able to get me out of this sticky situation,\u0026rdquo; right? And I think they are looking at this purely from a… how do I get out of here?\nBut I think in this moment, there\u0026rsquo;s maybe a slight change of heart, right? And this realisation that your circle doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be just Shadowside. Their circle doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be just the people that they have pre-approved as being trustworthy.\nAnd I think Mike and Hush spend the evening talking about all the moments in their lives that they have felt so lucky. And Hush has been vulnerable and has been open about how they felt stuck, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until they found me that the world really opened up for them. And how much they have come to depend on me as this key to freedom.\nAnd I think, you know, Mike resonates with this a little bit. Feeling kind of stuck in this small little… this little backwater village. And I think Mike, you know, agrees to help Hush get their ship back.\nAnd I think Hush brings Mike and Veronica on board with them. I also don\u0026rsquo;t think they tell them that they\u0026rsquo;re smugglers. [Laughs] I think it\u0026rsquo;s just very much a, \u0026ldquo;I should– I was so blessed to have the opportunity to fly my own ship. I want to give you the opportunity to leave this life behind and see the world.\u0026rdquo; And then will be smuggling on the DL.\nI do think that the Coalition eventually receives report that this ship has– had been impounded here, or has been, and I think they get away just in the nick of time. Like, you know, maybe half an hour slower, and Coalition ships would have been all over the place.\nBut they have escaped, and I think, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s a… certain freedom and a, you know– it\u0026rsquo;s excitement too, right? Like they bring Mike and Veronica on board and then open up the engines, open up the dual sweep drive. And just, again. I fly. That\u0026rsquo;s what I do, is I fly. And they laugh. And once more, they have skirted danger, and we get to chase the sun for another night.\nTIME PASSES SATAH: Now, \u0026ldquo;draw a card as time passes and you find your way into the service of a new captain. Take a moment to reflect.\u0026rdquo;\nWow, I ended up loving the Admiral. [Laughs]\nCALEB: My next card is the Eight of Diamonds, so it\u0026rsquo;s diamonds…\nCONNOR: Let\u0026rsquo;s see, this is a… diamond.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;If you draw a diamond or a heart, answer a \u0026lsquo;This Hull, This Home\u0026rsquo; prompt of your choice,\u0026rdquo; slash whatever you roll if you\u0026rsquo;re me.\nCONNOR: All right. I have rolled a three, which is \u0026ldquo;Painted with care.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: Ohhh… I know this is like immediately fixing this, but I like this. \u0026ldquo;Painted with care.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Who took the time to painstakingly stencil my name on my hull? And what does it look like?\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: So at the end of the last era, you know, we were hated by many, feared by many. And then Colma, as the one who adopted us back and knowing that– you know, we are a ship. We\u0026rsquo;re her design. No matter what bad stuff we did, that\u0026rsquo;s a result of the captains more than us, really. And if it is our fault, then it\u0026rsquo;s her fault, too– decided to show herself some care by showing some care to us.\nShe painted each of the flower gears by hand once again with a much stronger and more adult drawing hand. She stenciled our name, The Greenblade, on the hull and covered it in beautiful doodles and tiny hints as to the original myth. There is, piercing the words, a leaf blade, as wielded by the fairy from her story.\nAnd across the whole ship are filigrees, swirls and flowers and plants, drawn over time, a little bit at a time, between jobs, while we\u0026rsquo;re hiding and laying low, until eventually every plank is covered in beautiful swirls, drawn by someone who spent their whole life drafting precise blueprints and instructions for engineering.\nCONNOR: You know I- I think it was Veronica. I think the girl that they took a chance on and brought them into their safe space, right, like their– into me, into their home, has been inspired by the sky.\nAnd she loves to paint. She\u0026rsquo;s always chasing a bluer blue, and she loves the way that the outlines of clouds dance upon that bright blue canvas, and how it can– how it does its subtle change from blues to grays to purples and oranges as the sun sinks and rises above the horizon.\nSo I think one day… while we\u0026rsquo;re back at a beach– I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s the beach where Hush found me, but I think it is a beach reminiscent of the one where Hush found me– that Veronica is covered head to toe in white and blue paints as she hangs precariously over the side of my gunwale… gunwale is the edge of a ship, I think… as she hangs precariously over the side of my gunwale, sometimes upside down, sometimes, you know, turned 90 degrees, painting my name.\nAnd there, writ in fluffy white and blue letters, is \u0026ldquo;Ol\u0026rsquo; Saffy.\u0026rdquo;\nI think, yeah, I think Ol\u0026rsquo; Saffy has– like, O L apostrophe Saffy– has kind of become the name du jour. Because I think both Mike and Veronica both make fun of Hush for the way that they always say Ol\u0026rsquo; Saffy instead of just Saffy. And so– and I think Hush is like, you know, is like, \u0026ldquo;No! It\u0026rsquo;s just Saffy!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s not what you said.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so I think kind of as a– I\u0026rsquo;m going to say– I want to say jab, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a jab. I think it\u0026rsquo;s the way that we love to laugh with people about their small idiosyncrasies, right? The way that someone\u0026rsquo;s peculiarities really endear you to a person. I think that\u0026rsquo;s emblazoned on my side, written in the inks of the sky.\nSATAH: [Die rolling] Mmmm. \u0026ldquo;Marks on the mizzen for remembrance. How many members of your crew have been memorialised on your mast? Which one still hurts to remember?\u0026rdquo; Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s beautiful.\nI think… a lot of Laura\u0026rsquo;s crew. The tradition was, if you come to think of The Catching Net as home, you can become part of it by inscribing an initial or a symbol on the mast. And the majority of the crew who worked with Laura thought of me as their home, and so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of their scratches on there.\nThe pirates, I don\u0026rsquo;t think ever had that relationship to me. There are marks on the mast from them, but it\u0026rsquo;s from sword fights and practices and throwing daggers.\nAnd I think one of the crew here, this new group of rebels, under the Traitor Admiral [Chuckles]– they notice the names and the symbols one day. They notice these little symbols and they call the Admiral over and gesture at it. It was hard to see them underneath all of the sword stuff from the pirates and everything, but when you look closely, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that there are names or- or- or a symbol that is obviously personal to somebody.\nOoh, and maybe it\u0026rsquo;s that they recognise it, like– some of the bunks have these symbols. People on Laura\u0026rsquo;s crew marked their bunks with the same thing and they start to realise, like– somebody puts it together like, \u0026ldquo;Wait, that\u0026rsquo;s the symbol that\u0026rsquo;s carved on my bunk. Do you think that\u0026rsquo;s someone\u0026rsquo;s name?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think that… the Admiral puts her hand on these symbols and all at once, in a way that she hasn\u0026rsquo;t really before, realises how much of what she\u0026rsquo;s been able to do to help people has been because of me. My unique elements. The way I keep people safe, the way that I can navigate through the sky. And she\u0026rsquo;s touching these names and just has this rush of… gratitude.\nAnd I think- I think there was a little bit of a disconnection between us, because… she resented me a little bit for– she was put here because it was a symbol, right? Not because they actually thought that she was going to do well with it. And she didn\u0026rsquo;t realise until this moment how much she was carrying that.\nAnd she realises like, \u0026ldquo;Wait. Oh, god, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a fool. We\u0026rsquo;ve been working together this whole time. I kind of, on some level, thought that I was working against you. But no,\u0026rdquo; that– as much as it pains her to admit the power of those symbols and– because that was weaponised against her– she thinks of like that mission, that one where she came around the mountain and people started painting me. Not her, not the crew, me.\nAnd she suddenly really admires that or is grateful for it, and realises that when they\u0026rsquo;re approaching a dock– when we\u0026rsquo;re approaching a dock and she sees people\u0026rsquo;s eyes light up, it\u0026rsquo;s not because they know who\u0026rsquo;s aboard. Not really. They assume because they\u0026rsquo;re seeing me, they\u0026rsquo;re assuming that whoever is aboard is coming to help. And she is so happy about that.\nAnd… in a almost… I think this is relatively quickly after the schism actually happens. She\u0026rsquo;s a– we\u0026rsquo;re actually on the run now. And so it\u0026rsquo;s this sort of, like, exciting incitement of a taboo where she pulls out a pocket knife and scratches her initials into the mast. And the person who initially brought her over, like, laughs in, like, horror and delight. And she hands her pocket knife to them and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Go ahead. We\u0026rsquo;re all part of this, right?\u0026rdquo;\nThey very lightly, hesitantly scratch their initials in and then back up, and they\u0026rsquo;re, like, giddy and so scared of what they\u0026rsquo;ve done. And they invite everybody.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s not explicitly a memorial, right? But I think what it is, is that as people die… as– because things do get much harder. We are on the run. The Admiral, the Traitor Admiral, finds their initials on the mast… she doesn\u0026rsquo;t erase them. She like… pours a dye in them to make them darker and more noticeable, making them more permanent.\n[Sighs] And the thing about the question, \u0026ldquo;which one still hurts to remember,\u0026rdquo; is I do think that it\u0026rsquo;s the Admiral.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet how she dies. But she does. And then a member of the crew, with a shaking hand, spills ink into her name on the mast.\nAnd I think I… I have affection for all of my captains. I do. I think Laura was special. It hurts that she gave me up, but it was probably– it was the right thing to do.\nAnd The Corsair, I think– I saw them in a lot of states that people didn\u0026rsquo;t see them, right? Because when they were alone, they could be vulnerable in a way that they generally weren\u0026rsquo;t around other people. And so I did see their care. But also, they were an asshole. [Laughs] But I think I also appreciated that they did take, like– push me to my limits, you know? They really got to know me so that they could do these crazy maneuvers. And there is part of me that– that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s exciting, you know?\nBut the Admiral, I think… it feels so on purpose with her that, like– she didn\u0026rsquo;t like me and then realised she hadn\u0026rsquo;t been being fair and really embraced- embraced me and- and connected with me and thought that I was important. And so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to lose her. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to lose her.\nBut I do. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to go to the fourth era.\nCONNOR: Yeah. And we bring ourselves now to the fourth era.\nCALEB: Alright. Now I, the freshly painted Greenblade, back under the control of Captain Colma, head into the fourth era.\nGAME: THE FOURTH ERA RED ENDING V BLACK ENDING SATAH: \u0026ldquo;The final captain.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;The final captain.\u0026rdquo; So I divide the prompt cards I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn so far into two piles.\n**CALEB:**I\u0026rsquo;m now checking to see if over the course of the game I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn more red than black cards or more black than red cards. So let\u0026rsquo;s take a look.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;If over the course of the game you\u0026rsquo;ve drawn more red than black cards, go to \u0026lsquo;Once More to the Horizon.\u0026rsquo; If you\u0026rsquo;ve drawn more black than red, refer to \u0026lsquo;Things Fall Apart.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: Let\u0026rsquo;s go. Let\u0026rsquo;s do this counting. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn more red than black, but let\u0026rsquo;s… let\u0026rsquo;s find out for sure.\nSATAH: Holding them in my hands, definitely looking like there are more red cards.\nCALEB: I have drawn one, two, three, four…\nCONNOR: I\u0026rsquo;m going to count the black first. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go for the drama of it. Here we go. One, two, three, four…\nSATAH: [Card flipping sounds] Eleven red cards. Nine black cards. So not decisive exactly, but a clear winner.\nCONNOR: Nine black cards. Ten red cards.\nCALEB: Ten red cards. Six black cards. So, more red cards overall, by a pretty significant margin.\nCONNOR: I thought I was definitely gonna be clearly with more red cards. I did not think it was just one more.\nSATAH: I did count, like– at one point, I pulled two clubs for a captain, and so I had to pull another card… I\u0026rsquo;ve counted that in here. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure If I should? If I should like discard cards that weren\u0026rsquo;t relevant, but I just assumed any card that I pulled out of the deck should be part of this choice. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really change things either way for my particular setup, but.\nCALEB: So I\u0026rsquo;m going to be referring to\nCALEB \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Once More to the Horizon\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: to find my final captain.\nCONNOR: I am hopeful for the future.\nCAPTAIN SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Draw a single card. Its suit will determine your final captain.\u0026rdquo; Okay.\nCALEB: The king of clubs. A king! Clubs is powerful.\nCONNOR: I have drawn, for my last captain, a diamond.\nSATAH: Diamond. Diamonds are sleek. My final captain is…\nCONNOR: My final captain.\nCONNOR \u0026amp; SATAH: The Passing Stranger.\nCALEB: The Flag\u0026rsquo;s Servant. Oh, gosh.\nCONNOR \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;The world\u0026rsquo;s changed,\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;and the stranger wants no part of it.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;The world\u0026rsquo;s changed, but the servant hangs a familiar flag on your mast.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no place for them here.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no place for them.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Perhaps you can carry them elsewhere.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Perhaps you can carry them elsewhere.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Together, they say, you can help make the world a better place for all of us. They are hopeful, humane, and noble.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;They are wealthy.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Disillusioned.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Disillusioned.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;And hiding their true identity.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;And hiding their true identity.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Answer the captain\u0026rsquo;s prompts right away…\u0026rdquo; okay. [Chuckles] This is fascinating. Okay.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Describe Servant and the nation they serve. What sense do you get of how they view you?\u0026rdquo;\nI think Colma, at the end of the day, is an engineer. She was a freedom fighter. She was a face of a rebellion. And she loves the flying ships she creates. But she\u0026rsquo;s not a pilot; not so much. She\u0026rsquo;s not a captain, exactly. And she had the most amazing time of her life flying around with me, but there came a time where she had to pass the ship to someone else.\nAnd I think as the result of her rebellion, a small civil war was able to actually catch fire, and as a result, the last few years have meant a huge chunk of the Empire– several islands, all connected in a long archipelago– have begun fighting back and bit by bit inviting more of the islands under their banner.\nWhich actually isn\u0026rsquo;t a new banner, it\u0026rsquo;s an old one, as the Flag Servant mentions here.\nThe Empire\u0026rsquo;s symbolism had changed over time. I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly how, but I like to imagine the Emperor has been slightly changing the flag every few years to reflect his own selfish interests and desires. The flag becomes his favorite colour. It features his favorite bird.\nAnd what they decided to do when they started this– to fight back as a rebellion is to fly under the flag of this original nation, before the Emperor began to make it about him.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know the origin of the flag. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what it originally was but Colma now hands me over to a younger, experienced– younger and experienced, it\u0026rsquo;s true– a younger captain who is experienced specifically in flying airships. And when I am handed over to someone who really, really knows how to fly for the first time since I was fixed, after Colma repainted me and fixed me up and gave me attention, it\u0026rsquo;s truly the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been complete in the way she intended. I\u0026rsquo;m the best I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been, and perhaps now, even 40 years after my original creation, I am… the best ship in the sky!\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s how they view me. The Servant thinks I\u0026rsquo;m the best ship in the sky, and this captain is proud of what I represent. Both, you know, for the new movement and also something that has been brought back from corruption. People remember what the Greenblade once was and now they see it as it is, and know that they too can be that way. They too can come back from a time of darkness.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What exorbitant price does the stranger pay for you? What strange necessities are brought aboard to ensure their comfort?\u0026rdquo;\nStrange necessities makes me think they\u0026rsquo;re not strictly human. Like, that\u0026rsquo;s– that\u0026rsquo;s a vampire-ass thing to need, right? Strange necessities? [Laughs]\nCONNOR: Hmm, exorbitant price. Again I love the– I like the inversion of these kind of questions, where– or not necessarily inversion– subversion?– subversion of these type of questions where it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily a you know, one trillion dollars kind of deal, but a very dear price.\nSo, you know what, let\u0026rsquo;s try a different way of building this character. Instead of me trying to give them a name and stuff and then answering these questions, I\u0026rsquo;m going to answer the questions and then try and build them based off of what they have given up.\nThe first question is the question of cost. \u0026ldquo;What did they pay for me?\u0026rdquo; This one stumps me a little bit, right? You know, there\u0026rsquo;s… there\u0026rsquo;s like a part of me that\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, they paid their soulll.\u0026rdquo; But, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m not feeling like a devil\u0026rsquo;s bargain at this point in time. This is meant to be an optimistic one, right?\nI think the cost is an heirloom. I think the heirloom is an old crown. I think it is a crown made out of white gold that shines with the intensity of a lightning bolt, dotted with gray and blue jewels and pale… white- white- white, gray, and blue jewels, yeah. Uh, like gray and white jewels in in large kind of fluffy cuts upon a a blue jeweled background like, uh– like thunder clouds upon a clear blue sky. And depending on the angle of light, or the way the angle of light plays upon the crown, sometimes it looks like wearing a brilliant sunshiny but slightly cloudy day on your head, and sometimes it looks like wearing a furious storm upon your head.\nAnd I think in terms of strange necessities that are brought on board… I think it\u0026rsquo;s a… a mushroom farm. Or some sort of fungi cultivation array. They fly me to all sorts of places around the world, to different climates, different humidities, different temperatures, and they do little experiments with their mushrooms, and they tinker, and they draw, and they mutter to themselves as they fly me around the world.\nSATAH: This is a human. \u0026ldquo;Exorbitant price that they pay.\u0026rdquo; Okay, so.\nThe Admiral died. I assume people kept– that I kept moving. But maybe without the Admiral\u0026rsquo;s tactical brain, it did become harder. Hmm. Yeah, okay.\nSo the Navy caught up with us. And they took the ship. And the thing is, I\u0026rsquo;ve– I\u0026rsquo;m way too recognisable. They don\u0026rsquo;t even want to risk just, like, scrapping me yet or like painting over to make me less recognisable. They\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just fucking hide this skyship for like a hundred years until people have forgotten and then we can figure out what to do with it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I just sit in a warehouse. It\u0026rsquo;s miserable. Fifty years passed– pass. I\u0026rsquo;m not being taken care of. Seventy-five years pass. And I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what\u0026rsquo;s going on out there, and people don\u0026rsquo;t spend a lot of time talking around me, but I do know that, like, the uniforms of the people who come to load other stuff into the warehouse change.\nAnd I think the exorbitant price isn\u0026rsquo;t… money. This isn\u0026rsquo;t– they don\u0026rsquo;t auction– they don\u0026rsquo;t auction me off. But it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s a price of, um… status.\nI think, looking at the other prompt, which is, \u0026ldquo;Who is the stranger really? What confessions do they make to you in the long nights of your journey together?\u0026rdquo; This is the child or grandchild… grandchild. Of one of the people who was responsible for putting me here for a lot of the current shitty status of the world. This is their grandchild.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s, you know, a wealthy, established military aristocrat family a few generations in, and this kid just grew up hearing their grandparent and their parents talk about all of these victories and was like, \u0026ldquo;Fuck this, actually. It sounds like you did a lot of evil shit.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they leverage their family name to pull off a heist. To steal me.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Before the servant leaves port, they give an inspiring speech to their crew. How is it received?\u0026rdquo;\nUgh, it\u0026rsquo;s incredible! It\u0026rsquo;s so glowing. It already said it\u0026rsquo;s inspiring, so they are inspired.\nAnd I think that the speech is on the theme I was just saying. It\u0026rsquo;s on the theme of how every single person there has had to make choices and decide things for themselves in the moment that seemed smart, that seemed necessary. Each of those people was trapped into bad decisions that they would not have made if they had a real choice. But now they do have a choice, and many of them have already made it. And no matter who they were under the Emperor\u0026rsquo;s thumb or boot, they can be something different now. They can make a real difference. And I, the Greenblade, am a great example of that. [Chuckles]\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s how it\u0026rsquo;s received.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Who is the stranger, really? What confessions do they make?\u0026rdquo;\nThey confess to… their family lineage, and they confess to that the stuff they had to do that they hated did look like they were keeping in line while they were secretly planning their escape. They had to be cruel to other people. They had to verbally express their support of systems that they knew in their heart were hurting people and let it look like they were just kind of floating by on their privilege and their name… and know at any point that that could be true. They could just give up. And having that little, like, nagging thought in the back of their head, like, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve been playing this part really well. Maybe it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a part anymore. Maybe this is just who you are. Maybe you should just let it be who you are.\u0026rdquo; That nagging voice made them really hate themself a lot.\nAnd they want to prove to themselves that they\u0026rsquo;re not, right? They want to believe that they can do this and be good and bring back like… the thing that I was a symbol of well before they were born. They want to believe that that\u0026rsquo;s possible to achieve.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t– they don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s possible to do here. Their description says, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no place for them here. Perhaps you can carry them elsewhere.\u0026rdquo;\nThey\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to get out of here. We\u0026rsquo;re going to go to the other side of the world and see what we can do to help people there. Because this place, I\u0026rsquo;ve given up on it.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: I think the Stranger tells me that their great, great, great grandfather used to build ships, when they could be built, when they could blend this strange art and science together to create these floating homes in the sky.\nAnd I think he confesses to me that that art has been long lost.\nThe Leviathans have disappeared beneath the waves and faded into legend, and so there is only a finite number of airships left.\nAnd I feel alone.\nI think the stranger tells me that they believe there is a way to make these ships once more, without the heart of a Leviathan. I think they tell me their name is Jasper.\nSATAH: I really can\u0026rsquo;t think of… \u0026ldquo;what strange necessities are brought aboard to ensure their comfort?\u0026rdquo;\nI guess they come from a very wealthy home, so they\u0026rsquo;re used to a certain standard… maybe hilariously, this is a multi-part heist, and they, like– they steal the ship, and then they steal their bedroom. [Laughs] They just take all of the furniture from their room and just transport it directly onto me.\nI think the other maybe thing is they pick up a couple people. They\u0026rsquo;re friends who they think… oh, it\u0026rsquo;s like a big– it\u0026rsquo;s a thing that like, these are people who they\u0026rsquo;ve hurt while they were playing this part. And they go and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, you have no reason to trust me, but I know that this matters to you. Please come with me.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t. A lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t trust them. Or they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;What? Leave? But I have to make things better here.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd my captain is like, \u0026ldquo;No. We have to give up on– things can\u0026rsquo;t be better here. We have to go elsewhere.\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s a hard sell for a lot of people, but they do get some people.\nAnd the reason I bring that up here is because I think that does ensure that this is a comfort for them, that they have people that they know that they\u0026rsquo;re bringing with them. And also, this is evidence that they can make up for the things that they\u0026rsquo;ve done, starting with just these individual people. \u0026ldquo;If you can learn how to work with me, maybe even forgive me, then in the long term, maybe I can make up for all of it.\u0026rdquo;\nLEGEND CONNOR: Alright. I\u0026rsquo;m going to reveal my final card for my legend and answer the prompt.\nSATAH: Now… \u0026ldquo;draw a single card to determine your legend prompt.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: My next card is the Ace of Hearts.\nCONNOR: It is a diamond.\nSATAH: Got a club.\nCONNOR: And because it matches my Passing Stranger, I get to realise my legend. I am sleek and I am a folk hero.\nSATAH: That\u0026rsquo;s too bad. If I\u0026rsquo;d drawn a diamond… be a folk hero. \u0026ldquo;The Stranger turns their back on what they once were and dedicates their life to fighting for a better future.\u0026rdquo;\nUnfortunately, that\u0026rsquo;s not what I pulled. I pulled a club. So… the legend is \u0026ldquo;gilded cage\u0026rdquo;. [Laughs sadly]\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;The Stranger turns their back on what they once were and dedicates their life to fighting for a better future. Do they don a mask and moniker? What legendary injustice do we fight together? Who do they pass me on to in order to keep hope alive?\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think they don a mask and moniker. I think we know what the legendary injustice that we\u0026rsquo;re fighting is, right? It is this need to hurt a Leviathan in order to take to the skies. We know that is not true.\nI think this all comes back to time. To time and that strange fungal calcium substrate that years and years and years ago, Galoom wanted the time to grow, and the government said, \u0026ldquo;No, we can\u0026rsquo;t wait for that. We have to have this now.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think… Jasper and I have this time.\nHis little mushrooms become scale models of tiny flying machines. And on my deck, when he starts to grow larger and larger models, out of the very earth that we have spurned and floated away from, out of the very sunlight that keeps me alive. These ships start to… come to life. Their engines, their hearts start to beat with the rhythm of the parties that once danced upon my decks.\nI think my name has been forgotten. I am not the King\u0026rsquo;s Sapphire. I am not the Stalker. I\u0026rsquo;m not Old Saffy. When people see me flying above their cities, they just point up and they say, there\u0026rsquo;s Jasper.\nAnd what I and Jasper do is not flashy. It\u0026rsquo;s not glamorous. But we do light the way to a future where we can grow and live together.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You and the Stranger drift together away from the world, apart from it. All their days, they spend in recollection and bitterness. Eventually, you become a tomb, adrift and alone. Where do you end up? What condition will the next passerby find you in?\u0026rdquo;\nThey meant so well, but they- they just weren\u0026rsquo;t able to actually unlearn it. They weren\u0026rsquo;t as radical as they thought. They didn\u0026rsquo;t know how much they were protected and how hard the world actually is.\nThey didn\u0026rsquo;t handle it well. They hurt everybody who tried to support them and drove them away until it was just them and me.\nI\u0026rsquo;m hard to control as one person. Can do the basics, but… you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go anywhere too dangerous.\nAnd so, \u0026ldquo;where do I end up?\u0026rdquo;\nNear the end, they were so angry, and they thought it must be my fault. People weren\u0026rsquo;t responding to me in the way that they were supposed to. I was supposed to be a symbol and my symbology should have overridden their cruelty. People should have continued to see me as a beacon of hope– a revived beacon of hope– even if my captain was treating people poorly, not listening to what people need, and just doing what they thought would be best, often getting in the way of those who were actually helping and listening. And people started reacting to that as is completely rational, by rejecting it. And that must be because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t powerful enough as a symbol.\nAnd they want to talk to the person who made me. That person is long dead, obviously. But they want to get to the bottom of this. And so… they research this odd wood that I\u0026rsquo;m made of. They find the area that it has to be most likely from, and they\u0026rsquo;re starting to go back that way.\nAnd we don\u0026rsquo;t make it. Not all the way.\nThey die naturally and terribly and accidentally. It\u0026rsquo;s a heart attack or something else that just happens sometimes. There\u0026rsquo;s no particular glory to it. It isn\u0026rsquo;t a big moment of stress or a fight or even just they realise in a sudden rush what their life has become and succumb to it. They\u0026rsquo;re exactly as they have been, and it just happens. And it happens quickly enough that they don\u0026rsquo;t even have a chance to reconsider their life. They just die.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Blaze of glory. There comes a time when old courage and devotion is tested. What crisis pushes you and your captain to the ultimate sacrifice? What doom do you avert? And where does your battered hull come to rest, waiting for care and repair to raise you once more?\u0026rdquo;\nI think the Empire pulls out all the stops. They send their ships to destroy us. They invade the archipelago. They are attempting to quell it the way they once did. And in almost like a dark, frustrating mirror of my first battle, they send a dozen Greenblades. A dozen ships made just the way that I was, to attack us.\nBut those Greenblades, like me, were made initially with the wrong metal. They\u0026rsquo;re all just a little too slow. I\u0026rsquo;m able to move through, taking them out, one after another after another.\nBut there are so many of them, and before too long, someone who is very familiar with the Long Nines, is able to make that call. Three… two… one. And the blast shoots straight through me.\nNobody would even notice or think about this, but they managed to perfectly aim through my hull directly down the center of one of those little flower gears. And those flower gears are important. My machinery only functions because of them.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not the only thing that\u0026rsquo;s destroyed, but my propellers stop, my hull burns, the sail struggles to catch the wind, and in the three seconds I\u0026rsquo;m there, suspended, slower, while my crew tries to figure out what to do, the few remaining Greenblades are all able to charge the Long Nines. Three, two…\nI\u0026rsquo;m realising in a second that I should have used the word nine to say it was a nine-second pause, but whatever. [Laughs]\nThe doom that I avert is that I do my job. The captain is an amazing pilot. Those Greenblades are taken out where they can be. The larger ships, I\u0026rsquo;ve taken out where I can. And this archipelago, the rebellion against the Empire, will win because of me.\nBut I am destroyed and I hit the water and sink beneath the waves.\nSATAH: I was alone and– I was in a dock for seventy-five years, and then taken by somebody who didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what to do with me and didn\u0026rsquo;t listen well to experts.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m listing. I float for a while. Then my engines run out, and I crash. A little horribly. I don\u0026rsquo;t shatter, but it hurts. And I\u0026rsquo;m just on the ground, in a place that people don\u0026rsquo;t really travel that often.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s how I will be found eventually.\nCALEB: And that\u0026rsquo;s what happens to me.\nCONNOR: To this final question,\u0026ldquo;Who do they pass me on to in order to keep hope alive?\u0026rdquo;\nWell, the first new skyship just left the construction deck yesterday for its maiden voyage. As it flies off into the rising sun, there is a new way forward, because we dared to dream it and we dared to give it the time it needed to grow.\nWho have they passed me on to in order to keep hope alive?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been passed on to everyone.\nTIME PASSES SATAH: With that, \u0026ldquo;Prepare to say goodbye for now. You\u0026rsquo;ve come so far. Now it is time to turn to making an end of it on page 43 and answer your final prompt.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;After your final captain leaves your deck for the last time, take a moment to reflect on all you\u0026rsquo;ve seen and done with your captains and crews. Think about the ways you have changed.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Think about the ways you have changed.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Think about the ways I have changed. Think about the ways the world has changed.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Think about the ways the world has changed.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Think about the ways the world has changed.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Consider those who have used you for great and terrible things.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Consider your part in the passage of history and the way you will be remembered… or not.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;Or not.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Or not.\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;As the footsteps in my passages become ghosts…\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;As the footsteps in your passages become ghosts,\nCONNOR: \u0026ldquo;The shouts, laughter, and tears become nothing more than memory.\u0026rdquo;\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;The shouts, laughter, and tears become nothing more than memory, and time passes. Answer the following final prompt.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Answer the following final prompt.\u0026rdquo;\nCONNOR: I have this final prompt.\nCALEB: \u0026ldquo;Will you be ready when the next captain comes?\u0026rdquo;\nNo.\nSATAH: Oh, yeah.\nCALEB \u0026amp; SATAH: [Both giggling]\nCALEB: I don\u0026rsquo;t know if another captain\u0026rsquo;s ever going to come.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of my Admiral and the ways that she made people believe. The ways that we made people believe. I was so hopeful when the Stranger found me, that they\u0026rsquo;d really do it. And they couldn\u0026rsquo;t, but I still believe.\nCONNOR: I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m ready for when the next captain comes, because my time is over.\nCALEB: I sunk to the bottom of the ocean. A Leviathan has made its home in me. The world remembers the Greenblade, the original, and Colma. It remembers my captain and Admiral Glavik and the other captains who I didn\u0026rsquo;t name. [Laughs] They will remember me, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I\u0026rsquo;ll ever be piloted again unless the waters drain from the oceans or a Leviathan learns to be a captain, which maybe they will.\nBut I am not amphibious. [Laughs] I was not meant to sink beneath the waves. I won\u0026rsquo;t be ready when the next captain comes, because they won\u0026rsquo;t come. But I\u0026rsquo;m proud of what I\u0026rsquo;ve done.\nCONNOR: My era of machines that beat with bloody hearts has passed, and a more beautiful future awaits, full of skyships of all sorts of uncanny shapes and sizes, of bizarre and beautiful colours that will fill the sky with something other than blue for a change.\nSATAH: Next person who finds me, my next captain, is going to fix me up better than ever. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to go out into the world and make people believe that help is on the way by proving to them that it is.\nCONNOR: I\u0026rsquo;ve been dreaming a lot about the sky a lot recently. About the wind underneath my wings. About that freeing feeling as you fly so high you can see the curvature of the earth.\nI dream about my children that now get to experience that joy. They\u0026rsquo;re playing the coda now. They\u0026rsquo;re putting out desserts. My party is ending. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can\u0026rsquo;t keep the dance alive.\nWRAP SATAH: I didn\u0026rsquo;t do sci-fi! Like, immediately. I truly didn\u0026rsquo;t. Are you proud of me?!\nCONNOR: All right. Okay. Wow. Gosh, this was so cool. This was… this was good for me, I think. This was very good for me to do. I loved this opportunity. I loved this game. I loved being a skyship! Gosh, that\u0026rsquo;s so cool.\nCALEB: Cool game. Cool prompts. Very pleased. Voice tired. Sleepy! And hungry!\nSATAH: When I was sixteen, I was really into orchestra. I was a big orchestra dork and I would do orchestral arrangements of pop songs to play in my quartet because I was cool. And I would sign all of them Captain Satah. No, sorry. More accurately, Cap\u0026rsquo;n Satah. C-A-P-apostrophe-N. I was really into pirates. Really, really into pirates as like a part of my identity. So ultimately, you know, this is part of me too. This is part of me too. Even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t chrome and metal. [Laughs] Great.\nCONNOR: Thank you so much. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have a social media presence. Don\u0026rsquo;t try and follow me on anything. I heard in some episodes some people did plugs. So I am going to… I\u0026rsquo;ll give a plug. I\u0026rsquo;m going to plug two things.\nOne, I\u0026rsquo;m going to plug your local library. Get out there. Get, um… go take out a book or something or go check out a book on Libby or something like that. Libraries are super cool and super, super important. I cannot emphasise it enough. Go- go check that out. Go check out your local library.\nAnd then the second thing I\u0026rsquo;m going to plug is just… just trying to find a moment of peace and beauty. Right? Go for a walk and admire a stick, right? Go find a stick that looks really nice. Or go just kind of admire the way that the trees are currently sprouting their new leaves or that the sun sticks around for just a little bit longer. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be anything big or profound. Just, you know, you\u0026rsquo;re here right now and you get to see that and that rocks.\nCALEB: Thanks, everybody.

Uoshi is also the layout artist for the upcoming print editions of Galactic \u0026amp; Going Rogue, which is currently crowdfunding. His work is gorgeous and it is a treat to be on a team with him. I\u0026rsquo;m doing a bunch of actual play production and performance and writing and editing and behind the scenes work for that project and I would love it if you headed over to bit.ly/galacticgoingrogue to nudge us up to some stretch goals so I can do even more. If I sound weird, it\u0026rsquo;s because I ended up– I\u0026rsquo;m like, squishing my face because I\u0026rsquo;m excited about what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. [Laughing] I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nThe other two beautiful undead trawling the neon streets with me are Matt Orr \u0026amp; Alyssa. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a little bit more about them at the break.\nWe explain the concept of the game pretty well as we set up, so let\u0026rsquo;s just jack right the fuck in:\nGAME ALYSSA: Okay! I am getting ready to play Furyya.\nSATAH: This game is so prettyyy. [Laughs]\nMATT: It\u0026rsquo;s got– it\u0026rsquo;s red and black and white. You know, the logo is this unreadable name. It looks like teeth, vampire teeth, because this is a vampire… all I know is that this is a vampire-but-it\u0026rsquo;s-cyberpunk game.\nALYSSA: Love vampires, love cyberpunk, love the way that vampires are framed in this sort of cyberpunk narrative.\nMATT: So I\u0026rsquo;m already thinking about, like, being temporally displaced and like, does my character like– having to search the streets for a fountain pen, you know, when everyone else is doing voice logs.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t- I haven\u0026rsquo;t read anything yet. I\u0026rsquo;m going to get into that right now.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Furyya is a solo journaling game about survival set in the city of Belona.\u0026rdquo; [Checking pronunciation] Belona?\nALYSSA: \u0026ldquo;In a dystopian future where creatures of the night must adapt to the technology in order to survive.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;In these filthy streets teeming with flesh and bone bodies as well as metal and hybrids, you are part of the Calamity, an ancient clan of powerful vampires and must survive challenges such as war, assassination contracts, theft, hunters, corporations, religious zealots, domineering gangs, and other clans.\nALYSSA: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll narrate your story through logs in a terminal connected to the Bologna Matrix Network. Careful not to get hacked.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;For reasons unknown, vampires have lost the ability to grow in numbers and found a fix for the problem in technology: DNA alteration made possible by advances in a nanotech branch known as chimera. This has allowed them to program the mutation that creates new vampires.\n\u0026ldquo;In the beginning, vampires had their canine teeth and part of their jaw removed to make way for a cybernetic implant. As time went on, the process got simplified until the implants became very small things inserted under the cheekbones and connected to natural fangs.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m, like, touching my face so much to understand the placement of this– I\u0026rsquo;m just– I\u0026rsquo;m in it. I\u0026rsquo;m very in it.\nALYSSA: So it\u0026rsquo;s not just that we\u0026rsquo;re feeding and new vampires are sort of an occasional byproduct of that, it\u0026rsquo;s that we, as vampires, decided, \u0026ldquo;You know what we really need in the world? Is more vampires.\u0026rdquo; and invented a scientific solution to that, to be able to keep perpetuating, which is just fun.\nSATAH: The entire setting of this game is so, so my shit.\nALYSSA: To start off, let\u0026rsquo;s do some character creation.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Start by determining who you are, your name, physical characteristics, relationship with the clan, and relationship with the city.\u0026rdquo;\nMATT: I have read the rules and I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at all the character creation stuff. I\u0026rsquo;ve left a couple things to roll live.\nALYSSA: I am going to hold off on name and physical characteristics to start off and go with my relationship with the clan and relationship with the city.\nSATAH: The clan is Calamity. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to take a look at the Book of Fate… the second booklet– there\u0026rsquo;s the core booklet, and then there\u0026rsquo;s the Book of Fate that has some tables and some other stuff that\u0026rsquo;s very cool. It has a list of clans with some information about them.\n\u0026ldquo;Calamity: one of the oldest clans. Their philosophy values honor and sacrifice for \u0026rsquo;the family,\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; in quotes. \u0026ldquo;Today, it is among the smallest clans, but still the most powerful and richest.\u0026rdquo; Alright. I\u0026rsquo;m in the vampire mob. That makes sense.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;m going to be going through this adventure as Quaestor Imperius Karnak. As a member of Calamity, the vampire clan that is the oldest and richest one, most powerful. They have a lot of Roman-y sort of trappings, which is why I\u0026rsquo;ve taken on the low-ranking title of Quaestor.\nI appear as a waifish, very thin, nearly, you know, anime hero type thin young man, a middle aged man. I have silver hair, but very short.\nALYSSA: So the clan itself, Clan Calamity– this is a group that really sort of requires loyalty, requires honour. I think that I want to play with that a little bit. So I think I was first introduced to Calamity as a contractor, a bodyguard. A human, definitely, because I assume they\u0026rsquo;re not turning every person in contact with them, and they still have need of, you know, cannon fodder. I mean, they are one of the smallest clans, so.\nI think that they saw their values reflected in me, my sort of loyalty, devotion to the job, willingness to put myself in harm\u0026rsquo;s way for them. And that was enough to get me an invitation into the clan itself for them, to choose to turn me. Because a human bodyguard is good, but a vampire bodyguard is even better.\nAnd I mean, I think I was really good at my job and I was dedicated to it, but more than dedication to the clan, I was dedicated to the specific member who I was working with, who I was serving. You know, a very like bodyguard VIP romance dealie.\nBut they didn\u0026rsquo;t know that, and so I was turned and we… worked together. And we worked together well. And we became romantically engaged.\nBut while I valued her over Calamity, over everything, she truly embodied their values and her greatest devotion was to the clan itself. And at the time, you know, that was just another reason to love her, you know? Her dedication to this family, to this cause. But I think it ended up getting her hurt or killed.\nI think that she chose death over betraying the family to a vampire hunter. And that was, you know, the most Calamity thing that you could do. But it was heartbreaking to me, obviously, because she chose the clan over returning to me. You know, she could have given this hunter information about the clan, helped set them up against it, and then told me, and we could have gotten away before that blew back on us, before it blew back on the clan. But instead of doing that, she simply chose death.\nI feel betrayed by her and hurt that this family I am now sort of immortally a part of was a big contributing factor to her being gone from my life now, but, you know, she loved it so much and she really believed in it, and so I can\u0026rsquo;t quite bring myself to turn my anger against Calamity itself. And so instead, it is all focused on this vampire hunter.\nSo my relationship to the clan is a little terse, a little tense, but it was a part of my beloved. And so I can\u0026rsquo;t quite turn away from it, even though I am much less tethered to it than I was before.\nSATAH: Need a cyberpunk vampire name. The first one that came to me is fangs but spelled like F-4-N-G-Z. But the thing is this is, like, ancient– vampires have been around so there\u0026rsquo;s no way there isn\u0026rsquo;t already someone named F4NGZ. [Laughs] And I wonder if that\u0026rsquo;s, like, gauche.\nGoing to my old friend relatedwords.io and looking at words that are related to blood. Hemoglobin… serum… sanguinary? [Delighted chortle]\nAre all of the listed clans vampire clans? They are. Okay, so there are so many vampires. I think that means I should probably have a regular name. That, of course, is relative to the way that I normally name characters. So I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna go to my random noun generator.\nInspection. Ooh! Speck is a great name. And then I want, like… Calamity is, like, a family clan which like for vampires can, you know, be a little vague, like– that doesn\u0026rsquo;t– that could just mean like, a bunch of us turned each other, and we have, like, these ties, uh… vampires use– [Laughs] vampires have found family. Vampires have very violent found family, which is something I love about them.\nSo, first name is Speck, which might be short for Inspection… yeah, it is. I\u0026rsquo;m still me.\nAnd then… Calamity… Calamitous? Cataclysm. Inspection Cataclysm is pretty good. Maybe the last name is just Cata, and that\u0026rsquo;s essentially short for Cataclysm. Immediately thinking of some, you know, sexy vampire mob boss being addressed as Miss Cata is great. I\u0026rsquo;m spelling Kataklysm with Ks. So Inspektion, also with a K. Inspektion \u0026ldquo;Speck\u0026rdquo; Kataklysm. And I\u0026rsquo;m a vampire. [Laughs]\nOh, this game has me so hype.\nALYSSA: We can do name. I have a name now.\nSo I think that… I mean, if you\u0026rsquo;re living a hundred years, I think that name changes are maybe just a part of that existence. And I think that after my beloved died, I picked a new name. And it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily what I\u0026rsquo;m going by to members of the clan or to other people I\u0026rsquo;m interacting with, but it is sort of what I\u0026rsquo;m calling myself in my head, like a call sign as I hype myself up to get through the day.\nAnd so the name that I have chosen for myself is Tisiphony. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with she/her pronouns for my vampire.\nAnd I should also pick a name for my beloved. So going to the cyberpunk name generator, we are going to go with Ayla Solari. Also she/ her pronouns.\nTrying to decide if I actually want surnames. I think that we are a known group, and so maybe we don\u0026rsquo;t really even use surnames. If absolutely pressed, we could use Calamity as that surname. But you know, if you know, you know. And if you don\u0026rsquo;t know, then you\u0026rsquo;re probably getting a fake name anyway.\nSo I am Tisiphony, and my lady love was Ayla.\nSATAH: Name, physical characteristics… I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at that. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll make a picrew at some point, but whatever. Hot vampire.\nALYSSA: In terms of physical characteristics. I was a bodyguard. I\u0026rsquo;m still a bodyguard, though I\u0026rsquo;m now a vampire one. And I think that I am sort of very butch, very strong, very muscular. Wide, solid frame, lots of scars, shaved head.\nI think I have a cybernetic arm. Maybe I lost my flesh arm while I was still a human, sort of working to protect Ayla or another member of the Calamity, and that sacrifice is what brought me really to their attention and what helped lead into my becoming a vampire in the first place.\nAnd so this arm is definitely like old tech. Almost more mechanical than technological. And so I think because I am, you know, 100 years old, the technology isn\u0026rsquo;t like, cool retro, it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of old? But it\u0026rsquo;s really high quality and I am able to do repairs on it myself. I\u0026rsquo;m not locked into a contract with a corporation to keep it updated. I\u0026rsquo;m able to do everything myself, or maybe Ayla used to help me with it. And, you know, finding parts for repair can be a bit tricky, but that happens a lot less than I might need to do with sort of a newer tech arm. So that\u0026rsquo;s definitely a sort of focal point, a standout point. It\u0026rsquo;s, you know, a little bulky. It definitely doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like flesh. I think that it is sort of unvarnished metal, um, and it is clearly a little banged up just from years of wear, but very, very well tended.\nMATT: Imperious… uh, who probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t go by that. Probably has some diminutive. Maybe people just call him Karnak. But he wears a suit with, like, a preppy college sweater kind of look. I think, yeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s like a, you know, very dark gray suit with the sweater under the suit jacket.\nBut then, because you got to do something weird for this sort of future setting, um, like a capelet. Like a black capelet very much look– taking the place of sort of a, uh– I\u0026rsquo;m gesticulating to my shoulders. A sort of a casually draped sweater over the shoulders is replaced by this rain proof cape that only comes down to, you know, the mid- middle of the arms. It\u0026rsquo;s very all style, no function kind of a thing.\nAnd then I\u0026rsquo;ve also decided that he wears a phrygian cap, which is another Roman trapping thing that was a symbol of like, you know, liberty– which is all connected to the relationship that Imperius has to the Calamity.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s in the imp– he\u0026rsquo;s in the structure. He\u0026rsquo;s doing, you know, quote unquote, \u0026ldquo;what he needs to be doing.\u0026rdquo; But by wearing this hat, he\u0026rsquo;s sort of indicating that he\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily… totally down with the pure authority that I imagine is part of the– of Calamity. He\u0026rsquo;s sort of… you know, he\u0026rsquo;s pushing the edge of, like, what is acceptable to get away with in terms of like, you know, not following the orders, though he is in the structure of the leadership. Trying to work his way up, maybe.\nThe setting talks about that vampire teeth are sort of all cybernetic now, but I think that might be the only evident cybernetics that I have. So very minimal, as far as that goes.\nALYSSA: So the rulebook says, \u0026ldquo;The fangs themselves ran the gamut of improvements, made bigger and deadlier, often customized for sheer style, gleaming, finer, stouter, jeweled, metallic, and more.\u0026rdquo; And so based on the rest of my vibe, you might expect some pretty, like, workmanlike sort of practical things. Or, you know, if they are embellished at all, it\u0026rsquo;s to make them look more vicious, more threatening.\nBut actually, the fangs that I have are really small and delicate and almost crystalline. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re diamond. I just have straight up diamond fangs in my mouth, clear and gleaming with sort of slightest blush tone– not because they\u0026rsquo;re bloodstained. They are not. I keep them very clean, thank you very much. But just because that\u0026rsquo;s the colour of the material itself is a sort of lightly blushed diamond.\nAnd the reason that I have these wildly incongruous fangs is that they used to belong to Ayla. I imagine that the sort of technology of vampirism is guarded pretty closely by the different clans and by vampires in general. And I think that when Ayla was killed by the vampire hunter, the sort of proof that they sent back was just her fangs. And clan Calamity was going to, you know, inter them or put them in a sort of place of honour to recognise the sacrifice that she made for them, and I fought against that, because I really wanted to keep her with me. And… they saw my mourning and my grief and they went along with it.\nAnd they gave me her fangs and I was able to replace the… you know, very, I think, workman, metal like the arm, straightforward, boring fangs that I had with these ones from Ayla\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\nAnd they aren\u0026rsquo;t fitted quite correctly. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I let the cyberdoc, like, alter them at all, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to make many alterations to my mouth itself. So I think that I regularly have a sort of bit of blood in my mouth from the way that they don\u0026rsquo;t quite sit right, the way that they scrape against the inside of my cheeks. And that\u0026rsquo;s just a reminder, you know, of what I lost and why I need to take down this vampire hunter.\nAnd my girl does not need more reminders to hold on to her grief, but she has it in the taste of blood in her mouth now. So that\u0026rsquo;s great for her and her mental health.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Relationship with the clan.\u0026rdquo; Interesting. So without really thinking about it, I folded myself into specifically the family. And I wonder if… like, I think that what that means is that I was sired by somebody who was a big deal. Like, one of– like, the mob boss, Miss Kata, or something like that.\nAm I also literally her kid? … No. I think it\u0026rsquo;s something– it\u0026rsquo;s more like a… [Laughs] it\u0026rsquo;s a- it\u0026rsquo;s cut- it\u0026rsquo;s a- it\u0026rsquo;s a toxic polycule, the main Kataklysm family. Or the Katas.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think that everybody who\u0026rsquo;s in Calamity takes the name. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a title! Like, Kata Speck is really fun. And maybe, like– ooh, does that mean that it\u0026rsquo;s Miss Kata? Or is is Kata Kata? Or, fuck it, the leader of the clan\u0026rsquo;s name is Klysm. [Laughing] It\u0026rsquo;s terrible. But she\u0026rsquo;s called Kata Klysm. Yep! That\u0026rsquo;s true. That\u0026rsquo;s– that happened. Okay. Just gonna write down \u0026ldquo;Kata Klysm: the sexy vampire mob boss.\u0026rdquo; She/her.\nAnd so maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t have a last name. I used to, but I, like, gave it up. My name is just Inspektion. People call me Speck. But people who are lower in social ranking especially call me Kata Speck, as a title, because I\u0026rsquo;m, like, in the inner circle. High up in the family. High up in Calamity, the toxic polycule that rules this old clan. [Laughing]\nI do think everyone gives up their last name when they join as like a symbolic, like, joining the family thing? Yeah. Hell yeah.\nSo my relationship to the clan is that I think… the relationship I\u0026rsquo;m writing is going to be something like, \u0026ldquo;loyal, but volatile.\u0026rdquo; I am… I think that it\u0026rsquo;s… hmm. Where do I want the tension to come from here? Because I could be resentful of my place or I could be, like, intensely loyal. I want to find the thing that\u0026rsquo;s most interesting, because I like playing characters that are… intensely devoted to something terrible. [Laughing]\nSo there is a lot of loyalty there… do I want to start with volatility? Because one thing is that I can just angle myself into starting to feel tension with being asked to, as the book says, \u0026ldquo;the Calamity philosophy values honour and sacrifice for \u0026rsquo;the family.\u0026rsquo; And maybe… maybe part of the tension is going to be I have this intense loyalty, but start to resent that expectation?\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;m writing \u0026ldquo;loyal\u0026rdquo; and then I\u0026rsquo;m writing \u0026ldquo;(but volatile)\u0026rdquo; in parentheses to sort of emphasise to myself, like… the loyalty comes first, but it can be tested. And I\u0026rsquo;ll see what that looks like during play.\nMATT: And what is my relationship to the city?\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;After enduring war and civil unrest, Belona became the epicenter of commerce in the continent, home to high-rise skyports and vast docks, which ushered in economic development, jobs, and unbridled greed.\nAs the city attracted powerful figures, it also became the focus of intense territorial disputes, not just physical, but digital too. A good chunk of the Rises, as the active commercial sectors are called, also have digital versions in the network, so the public can frequent them in the web as well as in physical space. This was one of the major innovations attracting people from all over the world to buy digital real estate, as well as multinationals and a flood of unrestricted propaganda.\u0026rdquo; Hell yeah. Oh, god. I\u0026rsquo;m so in. I\u0026rsquo;m so in. The, I… [Laughing]\nMATT: Belona, I think, I think fitting with this sort of like– I keep thinking the word bohemian, right? But this isn\u0026rsquo;t bohemia. This is- this is fantasy Belona.\nHe loves the city. He loves going out in the city. He loves being in the city. He\u0026rsquo;s got a great love for the mixing of peoples and the sort of what\u0026rsquo;s happening there, even though, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s vampires, so it\u0026rsquo;s a feeding ground, but also it\u0026rsquo;s like– he likes the nightlife. He likes the culture. He likes the music scene and the dance scene, even if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t think he participates much, but he likes being in that environment.\nAgain, that\u0026rsquo;s part of the hat as opposed to the other things. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s– he\u0026rsquo;s expressing this sort of, like, maybe longing to be a part without being able to be fully a part of something.\nWhat a lovely character I\u0026rsquo;ve created. This is who I was in high school.\nALYSSA: In terms of my relationship to the city… I mean, we are vampires. And there\u0026rsquo;s nothing in the rulebook that says anything about immortality or expanded lifespan, but I imagine that has to be a part of it. And so I think that I\u0026rsquo;ve been living in this city now for, like, a hundred years. And that\u0026rsquo;s got to leave a mark, right?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been through the war here. I\u0026rsquo;ve lived through further civil conflicts, through all of the developments and ups and downs of the last hundred years. And I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s where the family is, but I\u0026rsquo;ve still chosen to stay.\nI think that, you know, our center of power might be here in Belona, but if we had wanted to leave, there would have been an opportunity to leave, and I never pushed for that.\nSo I think that I am pretty… I won\u0026rsquo;t say enmeshed, because I don\u0026rsquo;t think that I have much impact on the city myself as an actor. I am a weapon, a blunt instrument of someone else\u0026rsquo;s will. I\u0026rsquo;m not interacting with the city itself of my own volition all that often. I\u0026rsquo;m not making big moves. I, you know, live somewhere. I know my neighbours, but I\u0026rsquo;m not, like, a major part of the community or a power player, but I also don\u0026rsquo;t ever want to leave. And especially now that my beloved is gone. I mean, this is where my memories of her are.\nAnd so I feel, I think, deeply tied to the city in a way that is not quite reciprocal.\nSATAH: And what is my relationship to the city? That\u0026rsquo;s really interesting.\nThe phrase– the word that floated up to my mind immediately was \u0026ldquo;playground.\u0026rdquo; I think… I\u0026rsquo;m part of a very powerful, very rich group, and I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to make this person… a hacker. Heavy on the hacking.\nAnd so I think, like, Speck really has the feeling of, um, yeah, this is… my home and the place that I play. I- I am– not untouchable, but, like, the risks are worth it and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably win?\nYeah. I think that\u0026rsquo;s all I need there. I think just \u0026ldquo;playground.\u0026rdquo; My relationship with the city is that it\u0026rsquo;s my playground feels evocative enough to me to get going and I\u0026rsquo;ll see if that sort of develops further.\nALYSSA: Okay, the next stop on character creation is our attributes.\nMATT: Five points split between three stats. We\u0026rsquo;ve got vigour.\nSATAH: Representing physical prowess.\nMATT: Trauma.\nSATAH: Mm. Which represents your psychological and hacking capabilities.\nMATT: And insight.\nSATAH: Which represents your… sagacity? Is that what that word is? \u0026ldquo;Sagacity: the quality of being discerning, sound in judgment, and farsighted. Being wise.\u0026rdquo; What a fucking great word. \u0026ldquo;The quality of being sage, wise, or able to make good decisions.\u0026rdquo; That rules.\nAnd also, I think that a character who I have described as considering the city their playground probably is not super, uh… would it be sagacious? It would. The meaning of sagacity… sagacity. The meaning of sagacity is the quality of being sagacious. What a fuckin\u0026rsquo; word. That rules. Okay.\nALYSSA: It\u0026rsquo;s interesting to me that they put sort of psychological and hacking capabilities into the same statistic. And also calling it \u0026ldquo;trauma\u0026rdquo; is a… choice that I don\u0026rsquo;t quite understand.\nSATAH: So, five points. And what are these points?\nI believe that basically when I\u0026rsquo;m up against a challenge… \u0026ldquo;you roll as many d6 as the tested attribute\u0026rsquo;s score.\u0026rdquo; Yeah, so–\nALYSSA: I am a bodyguard. So I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to put my vigour at three points. And now the question is if I want to divide the other two points between trauma and insight, or if I want a zero and a two.\nSATAH: Let me just see what it means if I have a zero… I assume it means roll with disadvantage… or maybe it just means auto fail?\nALYSSA: I don\u0026rsquo;t see rules for what to do when you have zero points in a stat, but I think that I will go ahead and figure that out on my own.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to assume it means auto fail.\nBasically– so when there\u0026rsquo;s a challenge, you make a wager, which is you say like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a three.\u0026rdquo; There isn\u0026rsquo;t a thing– I think this is so fun. Because, effectively, it\u0026rsquo;s the same thing. Like, let\u0026rsquo;s say you only succeed on sixes and you roll a d6. It\u0026rsquo;s the same odds if you are calling, like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna succeed on a three,\u0026rdquo; or on a five. It\u0026rsquo;s the exact same odds, but you have, like, a personal stake in it, because you chose the number? I think that\u0026rsquo;s so fun.\nI can see a version of this game where I can\u0026rsquo;t handle that responsibility and just choose six all the time. And I love that as like a… I don\u0026rsquo;t know. There\u0026rsquo;s a cool feeling of like, hey, you\u0026rsquo;re going to decide, which means it\u0026rsquo;s the exact same odds, but it\u0026rsquo;s still somehow kind of your fault if you fail. [Laughing delightedly]\nALYSSA: I think that I will go ahead and figure that out on my own and give myself zero trauma and two insight. I think that of the two of us, Ayla was the one who was great with people and great with hacking, and so we relied on her for that. She was sort of the brains in that way, and I was the muscle. Though also, you know, decently sagacious. So that\u0026rsquo;s something.\nSATAH: You make your wager, you do your roll. If you get your number, you succeed. Otherwise, you then determine your failure by rolling another d6 that is, like… one is a critical failure with a harsh punishment, and then a five or six is a tolerable failure with no consequences… so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot, like– you can fail in multiple different ways, which is also one of my favourite things.\nAnd you can add dice to wagers through other means… I think? Mostly through advantages… yeah. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna assume you auto fail if you don\u0026rsquo;t have at least one point, so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna stick one in insight, one in vigour, and then I think three in, uh, what I\u0026rsquo;m just going to call T, because that is how the stat is referred to. That\u0026rsquo;s trauma. V, T, and S are the stats. And I don\u0026rsquo;t love trauma being used as a phrase in that specific way, so I\u0026rsquo;m just going to say T.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen one vigour, fitting, you know– not going to be very successful, punching, running, jumping. Two trauma, which also is– the game says are the \u0026ldquo;hacking slots,\u0026rdquo; which I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure totally what that is. I think some of the tech that I\u0026rsquo;ll encounter later, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to have slots to put cool stuff in your cyber body. And then insight, two as well.\nALYSSA: Finally, we roll 2d6. \u0026ldquo;The result is your fury, which represents willpower.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: And you can spend fury to add another number to your wager. So you could say like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a five and I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend a fury to add a six, so if I roll a five or a six, I succeed.\u0026rdquo;\nThe thing I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll here is the maximum. You can spend it, you can recover it, but you can never have more than you have at the start. So this is actually a pretty important roll.\nMATT: 2d6 fury. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll that now to find out how much I have.\nSATAH: I got a five.\nMATT: Five. That\u0026rsquo;s relatively low on 2d6. So that could be interesting.\nALYSSA: Ha! Okay. I got a two and a five, which is a seven, so sort of a perfectly average starting level of fury.\nSATAH: Importantly, \u0026ldquo;If you run out of fury, you are unsuccessful in your adventure. Describe your downfall. Death, madness, disease, etc.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs] So I\u0026rsquo;m, uh… you know. The maximum roll for that was twelve. The minimum was two. I got a five. So I\u0026rsquo;m closer to the edge than some might be.\nALYSSA: Honestly, this average level is… pretty positive. I am not mad at that.\nSATAH: You start the game with ten credits. Great.\nMATT: Ten credits to start.\nALYSSA: Which, looking at some of the cyber you can buy, is really not enough. You would hope that this tiny rich family would be funding me a little better, but I guess it isn\u0026rsquo;t to be. Possibly because I am off on my own doing things that they do not officially sanction.\nSATAH: The next thing I have to do is define my fate, which is essentially my goal in this game.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;m kind of intimidated by, like, how loose this game is.\nSATAH: I find this intimidating.\nMATT: It\u0026rsquo;s not prompt based. It– there\u0026rsquo;s a, there\u0026rsquo;s– what they\u0026rsquo;re– what is it called? The Book of Fate, so you can kind of randomise some things. It\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of 2d6 lists, but it tells you pretty explicitly, like, you make up your own character. What do you want to do?\nSATAH: I think the– because this is, like, a one shot, you know, I think that I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and find a specific quest to do.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to look towards the Book of Fate for this. So, \u0026ldquo;the Book of Fate is a tool designed to assist the gaming experience in Furyya. In this book, you will find lists for several different events, such as NPCs, upgrades, locations, karmas, and others that will help you build your narrative and the universe of your adventure. Before you start using this book, you can start by defining your fate, which characterises the goal of your adventure and defines the end game. You can also set small goals to achieve during the game. After setting your fate, as you progress through the story, you can roll dice to add elements from the lists to your adventure. Just roll as many times as you like for the lists you want.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to use the lists to set that fate, because I find just starting with the open field very difficult. I was worried that it would be much more open, but it ended up in character creation, I found a little bit more. Like, I know this person, Speck, is… kind of out on the town.\nIs- is, uh– what are Speck\u0026rsquo;s pronouns? I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to do she/her for Speck as well.\nYeah, and she definitely does her job, but also… kind of a work hard, play hard. And play hard can mean a lot of things and is often a little scary.\nMATT: So what I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that I\u0026rsquo;m doing, pulling with some of these classic cyberpunk-y kind of themes, is I\u0026rsquo;m doing a noir pastiche thing. I chose the capelet over the trench coat, but other than that, that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be talking to myself in these logs.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve decided that somebody up, higher up in the structure named… Praetor Daring Halicarnassus. He\u0026rsquo;s a couple ranks above me, and because I\u0026rsquo;ve got this connection to the city, I\u0026rsquo;ve got this relatively high insight– more than one, I have more than one insight– he needs me to go find one of his spawn, one of his creations. She\u0026rsquo;s left, and he wanted me to bring her back, but… maybe I frowned, and he told me that he… that I can– If I prefer to think of it as a welfare check, he is fine if I tell myself that\u0026rsquo;s what this is, and so I have.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll be going out into the city, looking for some– looking for this particular vampire woman who is missing from the clan.\nYou know, part of the backstory here in the– in the game materials is that the Calamity is not the only clan. It is the biggest and most powerful, but by no means is it the only clan, so either she\u0026rsquo;s gotten into trouble or she\u0026rsquo;s left of her own volition. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to be questing to find out.\nALYSSA: I think I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about this a little bit already in the sort of character creation, but what my character\u0026rsquo;s goal is is to hunt down the vampire hunter who killed Ayla and kill them. Because revenge makes everything better. It will certainly cure all of her sadness and cause no problems with or for the family at all in the future!\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to just roll on a couple of these lists and see if something starts to come together for what my kind of starting scenario is.\nThere is an event list. I\u0026rsquo;ll roll a d6. I got a five, which is \u0026ldquo;a secret of this magnitude will rock the city\u0026rsquo;s foundations.\u0026rdquo; Ooh…\nI\u0026rsquo;m also going to roll on the location table. Rolled a four, which is \u0026ldquo;The Towers: a focus of intense commerce, open 24/7, chaotic and loud.\u0026rdquo;\nAs I was going into this, I was thinking, I like the idea that this… that the start of this adventure is not totally on purpose. I think Speck is, like, doing her thing and then stumbles upon a situation? Maybe is even– maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll find out, like, what job she\u0026rsquo;s completing. But I think, like, that really plays into this– like, the idea that she was at the Towers and overhears a secret by accident and then has to do something about it is great to me.\nWhat am I– and I want one more thing. I could roll on threats, which is stuff like \u0026ldquo;a corporate military agent,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;a member of an enemy clan.\u0026rdquo; I could roll on karma, which is things like \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re consumed by rage,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re more afraid than ever before.\u0026rdquo; I am going to roll on that after to see sort of how my other job went.\nBut I think to get a bigger faction in play right away, I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on the list of clans and see if that helps me, like– if that brings me towards what the secret is that I found.\nRolled a five, which is Hoshi Inc. \u0026ldquo;One of the corporations responsible for the management and security of the Belona network. Perhaps the most powerful in information domain. The best hackers are Hoshi.\u0026rdquo; [Gasps] Cool. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So.\nI think– I think I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m- I mean, if they\u0026rsquo;re network security, like, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of like weird like secrets that I could learn there, right? Um, so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna let that percolate while I just step a little bit back and figure out what I\u0026rsquo;m doing when it starts.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also going to decide the format of my logs. This game, you\u0026rsquo;re asked to make logs– what does it specifically say about that?\nALYSSA: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll narrate your adventure through entries called logs. Each log can represent a long period, a single hour, a random sequence of event, or a day in your adventure. After that, describe the events that unfolded in any way that suits your fancy.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: Yeah, so basically just every now and then I have to do a log. And I think what this is going to be is messages to Klysm. I think I report directly to her. That\u0026rsquo;s how high up I am.\nAnd… yeah, I think they\u0026rsquo;re going to be just like check-in texts, basically, that I have to send pretty regularly. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll see what feels right in the moment, actually, that– I might, like, pause and write something out? We\u0026rsquo;ll see. We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nALYSSA: I think that this mission that I\u0026rsquo;m on to find and kill the hunter who killed Ayla is not condoned by the family. I think that we just don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity for it right now, and they would see sort of going after this hunter as a betrayal of Ayla\u0026rsquo;s sort of… bold sacrifice for the greater family\u0026rsquo;s well-being, right? Because if you go after this hunter and you get caught, well, now that\u0026rsquo;s another person that could be manipulated into giving up information on the Calamity if they\u0026rsquo;re not as strong as she was. Or it\u0026rsquo;s just putting another loss after loss.\nAnd so while my logs would usually be sort of mission status reports to a contact in the family, I think that they\u0026rsquo;re now going to a dead drop. I think that Ayla, sort of technological genius that she was, set up a little mailbox for the two of us. She is obviously gone and not maintaining it, but I trust her and I trust that it is still secure. So I\u0026rsquo;m leaving what would be my sort of mission reports there.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s almost functioning as a diary for me at this point, sort of speaking into the ether, speaking to her ghost, whatever it is, into this mailbox that no one will ever hear or see, hopefully, if all goes well.\nAnd again, because this isn\u0026rsquo;t a family sanctioned mission, I think that I\u0026rsquo;ll sort of be reporting in after significant events. Normally, I think that mission reports would be more time specific. Every few hours or once a day. But because this is lacking the structure of a formally sanctioned mission, I am just going based on vibes and when I need to vent.\nNot that I would admit that to myself.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll on the armament table to see how dangerous the job I was on was. It\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;no weapons,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;melee weapons,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;low caliber weapons,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;high caliber weapons.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll– and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;ll be literally the gear I have, but it\u0026rsquo;ll just sort of gesture at how difficult, how dangerous the job was.\nFour is \u0026ldquo;low caliber: pistols, revolvers, SMGs. Simple or with poisoning, thermal shock, and other effects.\u0026rdquo; Okay. And I am going to roll an event. One. \u0026ldquo;Assassination contract.\u0026rdquo; Yeah, that makes sense.\nI think I was sent to kill somebody. [Laughs] I think as sort of a flavour thing, I think– I specifically, the thing that I do a lot of, the thing that Speck does a lot of is digital assassinations, which can sometimes literally kill people, but sometimes just kicks them out of the city or makes it really hard for them to get in to, like, the digital version of the city, which is great because it means, you know, we can, uh… really keep a… just just make sure that the crowd is the way that we want it? I stumbled on that because like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. It\u0026rsquo;s good for all the reasons you might want to kill somebody. [Laughs] Which aren\u0026rsquo;t– aren\u0026rsquo;t good reasons. Right? But, like, you know. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason.\nAnd– because I was really drawn to the poisoning, so I like the idea that by poisoning, it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s, like, a virus, right? Like- like a computer virus.\nI went and met with somebody… what clan are they part of? [Die rolling] Two is Balthram. \u0026ldquo;The clan grew up during the Second Cyber War, made up mostly of spies from various nations united by fortune and power. They are cunning and not at all trustworthy.\u0026rdquo; Hell yeah. Okay.\nI was sent to deal with a spy. A Balthram spy who\u0026rsquo;s been lurking around the digital realm and got discovered, and I was sent to go take them out. And I think that… yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s– I, like, upload a virus to their avatar, basically, and it kicks them out. And probably scrambles their hardware a little bit? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t kill them. It could if their hardware is bad enough, but it definitely makes it so that they can\u0026rsquo;t come back, at least immediately.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on karma to see how it went. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do, like, a challenge here because this is just sort of like setting up where I\u0026rsquo;m at when I discover this big secret. But let\u0026rsquo;s see. Karma. Three. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re consumed by rage.\u0026rdquo; Hell yeah. Okay.\nSo how did it go? Why am I so mad?\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m mad because they saw me coming. Like, I managed to corner them and then they turned around and grinned and blinked– they said, like– they said my name or something. They were like, \u0026ldquo;Oh! Kata Speck.\u0026rdquo; And goadingly were like, \u0026ldquo;Really, I thought you\u0026rsquo;d find me yesterday.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I sort of, like, grin in this feral way, fangs flashing, and as I go to attack them– which would probably be like– well, they\u0026rsquo;re– are they a vampire? I guess the clans don\u0026rsquo;t all have to be vampires, do they? Maybe they do. Yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. They\u0026rsquo;re a vampire. But I still could bite them and deliver sort of the, like, virus payload, and I think as I go to attack them, they blink out of existence. Like, they log out.\nWhich maybe they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be able to do. Like, you are supposed to obey physical rules in the digital realm. You are supposed to, at least in some form, like, walk to the gates or something, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve been kicked, um, and they just blink out of existence.\nAnd that is infuriating to me. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to do my job. They did leave and that\u0026rsquo;s good. But, like, they left on their terms and they knew I was coming. So I\u0026rsquo;m just generally pissed. [Laughs]\nMATT: One last thing that I wanted to do before I actually sit down and make my little first entry is I wanted to go to the Book of Fate and I wanted to roll on the karma table and see what I get there. Five. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re more afraid than ever before.\u0026rdquo;\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s perfect for starting out this with Imperius, where this is probably his first real test of, like, vampire hierarchy politics. He\u0026rsquo;s been given this assignment. If this goes well, the Praetor will be on his side. If this goes poorly, uh, you know… I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they do to vampires who misbehave but, like, you know. This could be bad.\nI think the other thing that I want to play with in this story is this this wanting to belong but not being able to belong thing and the wearing the liberty cap and sort of like– I think he thinks that this is, like– if the woman that he\u0026rsquo;s after has found a better way of living, then maybe he\u0026rsquo;ll want to leave the the clan as well. Um, so I think he knows that in the back of his mind is a possibility on the table. So that\u0026rsquo;s a that– mm. That karma roll. Perfect. Perfect for what I was already thinking.\nSATAH: Going to the Towers, focus of intense commerce…\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m going to go talk to somebody who hooks me up with, like, experimental hardware and complain about what just happened and ask like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, why were they able to kick themselves like that?\u0026rdquo; And they are in the towers. And while I\u0026rsquo;m there, I overhear this secret.\nIt will \u0026ldquo;rock the city\u0026rsquo;s foundations\u0026rdquo;… is it related to what just happened or not? I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll on threats and see if that unlocks this secret for me.\n[Die rolling] Corporate military agent. Okay, so… Hoshi Inc. is a corporation that is responsible for the management and security. And I think what this means, having rolled a corporate military agent, I think what I overhear is a deal. The government is trying to acquire the network, essentially. And I think, like– normally it\u0026rsquo;s, like, there\u0026rsquo;s a service that is owned by the government and private corporations are trying to take it, right? But I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do the opposite.\nAnd I think the idea that the government will be maintaining this network would absolutely rock the foundations. For some people– some people would probably think it\u0026rsquo;s good. I think that I think it\u0026rsquo;s bad. Because, like, Hoshi is a rival clan, but they\u0026rsquo;re still a corporation, and they can be bought, and the Calamity has a lot of money. And so the idea that the network might end up being publicly controlled by people who cannot as easily be bribed and who would have more desire to regulate it and legislate it and just, like, have it be accessible and not quite as manipulatable? Um… theoretically.\nAnd also the military, so, like, they\u0026rsquo;ll be collecting data for their own purposes… which, like, the corporation also does, but I think that my perspective is, like, I understand the motivations of Hoshi, because they\u0026rsquo;re similar to mine? Profit. The military, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what their goal is, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nYeah. That\u0026rsquo;s what I hear. The government is– the military… government… wait, sorry. Corporate military agent. Corporate military. Same– no, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. The table was there to inspire me. I can ignore that. That\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nYeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s that. And- and what is my goal? I want to… tell the higher-ups in my clan what\u0026rsquo;s happening, figure out a way to maybe see if we can find more information and figure out a way to either stop it or come out on top?\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s probably enough to get started. I just heard the secret and I\u0026rsquo;ll figure out what I want to do about it. Yeah.\nBREAK SATAH: Alright! Hell yeah! Fifty minutes in or something and now it\u0026rsquo;s break time. [Laughs] My guests on this series are Matt Orr and Alyssa.\nYou can follow Matt Orr on Instagram at wetinkgames or check out all things wet ink at wetinkgames.com.

Or just chill. You can also just chill if you want. I\u0026rsquo;m happy you\u0026rsquo;re here. Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nGAME ALYSSA: Okay! Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to actually play the game.\nSATAH: I think I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to start by making a log, my very first log. This is what I was doing when I overheard the secret.\nMATT: Alright, so now I\u0026rsquo;m going to make my entry, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll see if I can find the voice for this character.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a few minutes to, like, write out a message to Klysm, and then I will come back.\nALYSSA: I think that the first thing that I\u0026rsquo;m going to do here is… let\u0026rsquo;s see. Let\u0026rsquo;s roll an event, maybe, and see if we want to go with that. I got a three, \u0026ldquo;the Calamity seeks vengeance,\u0026rdquo; which is very funny because my whole conceit is that the Calamity doesn\u0026rsquo;t seek vengeance, but I do.\nSo I think that what that means is that I am going to start by trying to… you know, just to really reinforce the vengeance, I\u0026rsquo;m not going after the vampire hunter directly; I\u0026rsquo;m going to go after one of their apprentices. They took someone from me. I\u0026rsquo;ll take someone from them. It\u0026rsquo;s just the natural order of things and not unhealthy at all.\nSATAH: Okay. What I\u0026rsquo;ve written for Log 001 is…\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Log 001. Year 3125 of the Calamity. The year of Consuls Corinth and Mycenae.\nReceived a summons today from Praetor Daring Halicarnassus. He has entrusted me with performing a welfare check on a woman from his family. Charitable Praug hasn\u0026rsquo;t been seen here in the hall for a while. He\u0026rsquo;s concerned about her. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of other clans out there, but there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a ransom note.\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to sound all hard about this, but this is a big deal. It\u0026rsquo;s up or out at every tier. A Praetor\u0026rsquo;s support would be a real help. Or… well, I\u0026rsquo;ll just have to find her.\nSo, where to look for Miss Praug? She had friends. I got a list. I\u0026rsquo;ll start with them. Hopefully pick up a few hints. There\u0026rsquo;s nightlife all over Belona. I can work and listen to the light harmonics at the same time.\nShe might have gone in hard for the implants. Might have never gotten up off the table.\nWould she go by her name or use an alias? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t know! I\u0026rsquo;ve not done this before! I- I find things for people. Books. Specialty orders. That\u0026rsquo;s basically a glorified research position! I don\u0026rsquo;t really know how to find anyone. In the city?!\nWell, it starts the same way, right? Start from what\u0026rsquo;s known. Her friends. All the way down on fifteen is Embracing Torino. I\u0026rsquo;ll start there.\nEnd log.\nSATAH, AS SPECK: Boss. The Bal forced a log off. Not a euphemism. By all accounts, they\u0026rsquo;re out of the system for real, though. On my way to TRAINR\u0026rsquo;s now to see what fucking tech they might have had. Beep me if you need anything.\nSATAH: TRAINR is what I\u0026rsquo;m going to call the cyberware dealer, and it is spelled without an E. T-R-A-I-N R. TRAINR. [Laughs]\nMATT: Because this game is so loose, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about how to– how I want to organise it for myself. So what I\u0026rsquo;ve decided is that about three rolls or tests or consultations on the Book of Fate, we\u0026rsquo;ll make, sort of like– those three beats will then get turned into one entry with Imperius\u0026rsquo;s progress so far.\nSATAH: Speck is like… sends off this message in the Tower. I picture her in like a really stupidly long elevator ride up to where TRAINR is. She\u0026rsquo;s like, looked through the logs to see like, did the spy just disappear but is still logged in? As far as I can tell, no.\nOoh… do I want to wager that? Or do I want to wait? No. Okay. I think they are actually gone, by all accounts. They actually logged off and the thing that is weird is just like, they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to do that. They shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to just log off like that.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going up to see what the cyberware is. I send off this message to Klysm. The messages are of course encrypted, but still try not to put information in there because I\u0026rsquo;m good and we\u0026rsquo;re good, but… you know. This is a- this is a city where you try not to write down anything that you do. And I know that better than anyone because I get a lot of power over people by finding stuff that they wrote down that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have. [Laughs]\nI get off this stupidly long, like minutes and minutes long elevator. This is a very, very tall tower. And I\u0026rsquo;m waiting outside TRANR\u0026rsquo;s. I think TRAINR deals cyberware and also does like, you know, is a classic cyberpunk street doc, does some of the installation. I\u0026rsquo;m waiting for them to get out of surgery.\nJust for fun, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna look at the cyberware list and see what they\u0026rsquo;re installing just because I think it\u0026rsquo;s fun. Let me see how many things are on this list. There are fifteen. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll a d20. Rolled a 10. [Counting out loud] 9, 10… \u0026ldquo;Gnarly fangs. Two pairs of long customisable fangs that replace the canines with a metal structure that also identifies body temperature and reacts to extraction by expelling a chemical substance that reduces the target\u0026rsquo;s euphoria on contact with the skin, making the target docile.\u0026rdquo; Holy shit! That rules. Yeah, absolutely.\nSo they\u0026rsquo;re currently installing gnarly fangs on somebody. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on an NPC table to see if they\u0026rsquo;re a friend or not. Rolled a six, which means they\u0026rsquo;re from a rival clan. And which clan is that? Interesting. I rolled Calamity, which is me. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll again. I rolled Calamity again. Okay. And then I got Balthrum. Huh. Okay.\nSo just real quick, I think that right now– and I don\u0026rsquo;t– Speck doesn\u0026rsquo;t know this– TRAINR is installing these nasty fangs on somebody who… I was going to say double agent. They are currently a rival; that\u0026rsquo;s what I rolled. And I rolled Calamity twice and then Balthram, which makes me think that they defected… twice. They were a member of Calamity. They defected to Balthram, which is the spy clan. And then they came back to Calamity and it turned out they were a double agent. And. It\u0026rsquo;s shocking that they\u0026rsquo;re around.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t super important, probably? But I love to roll on tables and have NPCs. They\u0026rsquo;re going to be sedated anyway. But just- just to have them around.\nCyberpunk name generator, Dax Nocturne. Absolutely. Just going to add them to my NPC list. Dax Nocturne.\nPart of this, I think, is that I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Come on, Train, we talk while you\u0026rsquo;re in surgery all the time.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Uh-uh. I don\u0026rsquo;t trust– you can\u0026rsquo;t be in this room. I don\u0026rsquo;t trust you. Look, be cool. But Nocturne\u0026rsquo;s in town.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Dax fucking Nocturne is in town?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Look, look, look! Yeah! There\u0026rsquo;s no rules against it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m just seething. I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, no, you\u0026rsquo;re right not to trust me because I would absolutely kill them while they\u0026rsquo;re under sedation.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd TRAINR\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I know. And I would lose a good customer. So stay the fuck out here. Chill out. And I\u0026rsquo;ll come talk to you when I\u0026rsquo;m done.\u0026rdquo;\nThey\u0026rsquo;re in surgery. I\u0026rsquo;m hanging out. I\u0026rsquo;m bored. Speck is not good at staying still, I think, and she has a habit of just kind of hacking stuff and this is how she ends up uncovering this secret– this thing about the military planning to acquire the Belona network.\nI hack into… I think I just see a signal that I don\u0026rsquo;t recognise? I\u0026rsquo;m like– I have, like, a, you know, just something that, like, shows you, like– the equivalent of being like, \u0026ldquo;Ooh, what wi-fis are here?\u0026rdquo; But I can see, like, some, you know, signals that are going through the air, like– people, like– communication signals. And I see one that I don\u0026rsquo;t recognise, and just as- out of habit- hack into it to see what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\nAnd it is this very secure line between Hoshi and a representative of the military talking about this deal. And I am– I think this is a challenge.\nMATT: I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the skill roll system here to see how their conversation with Embracing goes.\nSATAH: The challenge specifically is like, do they know that I hacked in?\nALYSSA: I could try to lure them into a trap, but I think that this is just raw rage that is driving me at this point. And so I am going to roll using vigor instead.\nI have three points in vigor, which means I get to make a wager and roll three die. So basically, I pick a number from one to six. And if that number shows up on one of my three dice, then I win. And otherwise, I fail.\nMATT: It\u0026rsquo;s a system designed for you not to succeed very often, I think. And maybe that\u0026rsquo;s fit to theme, so. \u0026ldquo;Make a wager.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;s called. And you pick a number one to six and then roll a die, and if it comes up with the number you picked, you did it, and if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, you fail. And then you roll again to see how bad your failure is. So like I said, that\u0026rsquo;s pretty- pretty tough odds. I think it\u0026rsquo;s encouraging you not to come up against a bunch of stuff that you have to see whether or not you succeed? But that\u0026rsquo;s sort of the fun.\nSATAH: This will be a T test, which I have three in. So I would roll 3d6.\nI do, however, think it is fair to say… Hoshi is network security. Uh, and the games– the table says about the clan, like, the best hackers are with Hoshi. And so I think I\u0026rsquo;m at a disadvantage here.\nSo \u0026ldquo;your tested attribute suffers minus one until the end of the challenge.\u0026rdquo; So I\u0026rsquo;m down to 2d6. Do I want to spend a fate here? No, it\u0026rsquo;s early. Things are tough.\nALYSSA: I like the idea of succeeding on this first activity, um, and failing later so I will go ahead and spend one Fury.\nAnd the numbers that I will call are three and five, so time to roll. [Shaking dice]\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go, I think, uh… trauma is psychological capabilities, so I think that\u0026rsquo;s what we need to roll. So it\u0026rsquo;ll be 2D6. I\u0026rsquo;m going to pick the number four. [Dice rolling]\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to see if I get out without them hearing me. I have 2D6 because I\u0026rsquo;m rolling with disadvantage because these are way better hackers than me. And… what do I want– what do I want to roll here? I want to roll a one. Because I want to roll a small number. To get out undetected. So, rolling 2d6, and hopefully, one is a one.\n[Dice rolling] Nope! [Laughing] A four and a five. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll a d6 to determine my failure…\nMATT: And neither of my dice came up four, so I failed to get any useful information from my conversation. But how bad is it? [Dice rolling] That\u0026rsquo;s a two.\nSATAH: Three.\nMATT \u0026amp; SATAH: Failure. Punishing consequence.\nMATT: Uh…\nMATT \u0026amp; SATAH: Great. [Satah laughing]\nMATT: I think… there\u0026rsquo;s a misunderstanding of some sort that occurs and, um, Embracing is not interested in talking to Imperious at all about where, um– where Charitable has gone. And perhaps is even attacked and driven out of the, uh– of the floor with no information. He\u0026rsquo;s got no clues and- and is so sort of embarrassed, almost, that this has happened, that he just doesn\u0026rsquo;t go to any other people within the potential circle.\nI think that leads me to use the Book of Fate now to determine what sector of the city I kind of go to. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got location list here. Let\u0026rsquo;s see that. [Die rolling] Wow, low rolls again. \u0026ldquo;The Drip Nightclub, a place shared by vampires and humans. It belongs to the Calamity Clan.\u0026rdquo; Alright, that makes total sense that that would be sort of a default place to go. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that that is going to result in like a test or a check… I don\u0026rsquo;t know I have to wager anything on that.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s see what would be the next beat before I make my next log. I think… maybe he follows some sort of intuition and just kind of goes… somewhere… but he\u0026rsquo;s going to meet some sort of NPC… yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s use the Book of Fate again here to meet someone that- that– meet someone at the club that\u0026rsquo;s gonna go somewhere.\nSATAH: So, obviously, they know that I\u0026rsquo;ve overheard this. Uh, like… I think I\u0026rsquo;m not hearing them talk. I think I– I\u0026rsquo;m I\u0026rsquo;m seeing like a- an automated transcript of their communications. I think they are– they are talking out loud. I\u0026rsquo;m not hearing it. I\u0026rsquo;m seeing a transcript. And… what is it that I do? I think…\nI try to download it. I try to download the transcript. And I\u0026rsquo;m often able to do this undetected, because I am good at this, but they\u0026rsquo;ve got somebody watching– they\u0026rsquo;ve got somebody on the line who\u0026rsquo;s better and notices the connection before I can hide it. And not only did they notice, this is a failure with a punishing consequence. They\u0026rsquo;re tracking me. Like, immediately.\nI, like– I try to open the connection to download it. And not only does it not work, something comes through the other way, and they know where I am, and I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to disable it.\nSo. Actually, I think– I think I\u0026rsquo;m like– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– they\u0026rsquo;ve got this tracker on me. And I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do another wager here to try and disable it. I shut down the connection. And I know that they know where I am. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and at least disable it so that I\u0026rsquo;m– I can move. We\u0026rsquo;ll see. I\u0026rsquo;m still at a disadvantage here because… they\u0026rsquo;re still better than me.\nUm, this is a 2d6 and I, uh… I want to roll three here. It\u0026rsquo;s my personal lucky number. So. Well, lucky… whatever. It\u0026rsquo;s a number I really like.\n[Dice rolling] I rolled a one and a six. Nope! Let\u0026rsquo;s see how bad a failure it is. [Die rolling] Three. Punishing consequence. [Audibly smiling] Great.\nALYSSA: I got a three, a five, and a one. So I do succeed on this task of finding the vampire killer– or, rather, finding their apprentice– and facing them down. And I think that the place… that we are going to do that, I can roll for, as well, on a location table.\n[Die rolling] Oh! And that is a six, which is, \u0026ldquo;The Gardens. The upscale part of the city with skyscrapers as far as the eyes can see and luxurious residences above the clouds. An area controlled by Belona\u0026rsquo;s leading corporations.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: How do I make it worse?\nMm. This whole time I\u0026rsquo;ve been, like, leaning on the wall outside of TRAINR\u0026rsquo;S. Devastatingly cool. Uh, just posed as fuck. [Laughing] On my– probably not even on my phone. On some, like, uh… my hands are in my pockets and I have, like– I\u0026rsquo;m using, uh, some… like, an internal overlay. Maybe I have a single– like, I have- I have a single, uh, sort of frame put down over my eye. Because I think those look cool.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve been leaning and then… if you were really looking at me, it would be obvious that I tense up when shit starts to get bad. But otherwise, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty chill. I\u0026rsquo;m still posed.\nAnd as I try to disable this tracker, out of the corner of my eye, I see one of the Tower\u0026rsquo;s private security… who isn\u0026rsquo;t Hoshi, because they do sort of the digital stuff. It is just- just a private contractor who is like a physical bodyguard. Their eyes move like they are getting a message and reading it on sort of, like, an implant? And they start looking around. And I feel pretty confident that they\u0026rsquo;re looking for me.\nI think in this moment, I\u0026rsquo;m going to allow Speck to just slip into TRAINR\u0026rsquo;s. This threat is still very active, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to– I think it\u0026rsquo;s more fun to let it linger rather than be like, roll to see if she can get away. I think it\u0026rsquo;s more fun to be like, is she going to get trapped in this storefront? Because maybe. [Laughing]\nMATT: So let\u0026rsquo;s see. We got a… [Die rolling] young adult [Die rolling] Calamity Clan member who [Die rolling] is dangerous. Alright.\nSo I think, yeah, he\u0026rsquo;s putting out a signal at the Drip nightclub. He\u0026rsquo;s looking for information and somebody tells him, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, yeah! I know all about it. Come with me.\u0026rdquo;\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s another… as a dangerous person, I think this is an opportunity for Imperius to kind of see… this isn\u0026rsquo;t even real danger. This is, like, getting mixed up with violent people at an event. You know? But it feels like true peril, I think.\nI think– I\u0026rsquo;ve somehow imagined this Imperius to be kind of cloistered as if, like– he\u0026rsquo;s very bookish for a vampire. So even though he likes going out, this is really– he\u0026rsquo;s put his foot in it with this dangerous person.\nBut I think he escapes without any actual danger because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make another roll to see what happens for this log. So I think this is going to be a series of failures. And he\u0026rsquo;s going to be not- not too happy with himself.\nAlright, let me get something written up.\nALYSSA: So! What is the vampire hunter… and not even the great strong vampire hunter who managed to take down one of the Calamity. What is their apprentice doing in the upscale part of the city?\nI mean, I suppose that we have a lot of power by virtue of being wealthy. And so there are probably corporations who keep vampire hunters on their payroll, maybe on the DL, maybe sort of openly? Um, and so I think that this apprentice is on the payroll of a company, and that is unrelated to them going after Calamity and after Ayla. That is a different side hustle, but it is the reason that they have a residence in the Gardens and are able to afford that.\nAnd I should give this hunter a name, so, pulling up my little cyberpunk name generator again…\nThe vampire hunter\u0026rsquo;s apprentice is named Braum Coldera. Um, let\u0026rsquo;s say he/him, and ze/zem pronouns.\nAnd I am just hunting down Braum in their Garden\u0026rsquo;s residence. It is bullheaded and messy, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that they have cameras and security and the vampire hunter themself is gonna know pretty immediately what I have done, but that is good. That is what I want. I want them to feel just even the smallest modicum of pain that I felt when I opened that package and found my love\u0026rsquo;s fangs in it.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and otherwise self-paced TTRPGs.

I\u0026rsquo;m gonna take one– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna just take a couple minutes to, uh, write it out.\nMAT​​T, AS IMPERIOUS: Log 002: The Praug File.\nWell, this is not how I wanted it to start. I went down to level 15 and talked to Miss Torino. She\u0026rsquo;s a lot older than I imagined she\u0026rsquo;d be… feeding for a long time. A lot of ideas in her head. Frankly, she talked rings around me.\nI still might have gotten some out of her if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned Halacarnassus. I thought mentioning a Praetor who was involved would win some cooperation, but it just made her more angry. She started yelling about corruption in every rank of the Cursus. I was already backing down, trying to get away, but the other women on the floor started coming out of their doors. Some of them were yelling, too. They called me a disgrace and mocked my cap.\nI was leaving! I was trying to leave, but they all wanted to look at me, to– a sniff of me. Miss Torino said they\u0026rsquo;d all know me for the rat I am if we ever met again.\nI can guess a good number of those women knew exactly where Miss Praug is, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know. How can they- how can they be in the hall and still have such contempt for the leadership?\nI got back up to street level and went out into the rainy night. It\u0026rsquo;s always a rainy night.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I was really thinking. I sort of just walked and found myself at The Drip. Hadn\u0026rsquo;t been there in a while, but it seemed the same as ever. I figured a place run by the Calamity would contain someone who both knew Miss Praug and would talk to me.\nInside, I saw Enraptured, and a little while later, I saw Teeming. They both have entourages now. Humans and vampires and security. Rapture had Hovecams streaming it all live. I checked. He\u0026rsquo;s up to 34 million followers! I knew him when! Or… he knew me when.\nThey didn\u0026rsquo;t know Miss Praug. Not even Teeming could tell me more than I got from Halacarnassus. At least that confirms I\u0026rsquo;m not chasing a ghost– he had seen her before.\nI got a drink– just some AB stuff– and was having a think when someone came up to me. A tall woman. Just turned. Very visible bite implants. Fashionable dress. She told me she\u0026rsquo;d heard me asking around and would like to take a message to Miss Praug. Enlightened Canossus is who she said she was. I confirmed later, but I should have looked her up right then. She\u0026rsquo;s one of Praetor Grieving Samarican\u0026rsquo;s faction– I would guess, from what happened, a Lichtor.\nBut… then she said she was just concerned about Charitable– just as concerned as I was. But she wanted to know how I knew her. And again, she offered to take a message.\nI kept the Praetor\u0026rsquo;s name out of it this time. I could feel that we were talking past each other, not really communicating, and there was definitely more that she wanted to tell me, or something. I kept asking to meet Miss Praug. Eventually, she agreed, and we went back out onto the streets. Then she just hit me. Her hand opened up into energy claws– real, real rumble pit stuff. I got no defense against that.\nI ran. I\u0026rsquo;m on the Skyway tram now. Lots of people around, none of them currently looking at me.\nThis is not about Miss Praug. What is this about?\nEnd log.\nSATAH: Well, that didn\u0026rsquo;t end up being a very long pause at all. For log 002, I\u0026rsquo;ve written, \u0026ldquo;Boss. Compromised. Going dark.\u0026rdquo; [Chuckles] As Speck cuts off some communi– like, logs off the Calamity net in hopes that, like… even if she gets found, like… or is worried that there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a worm in the tracker, basically? And doesn\u0026rsquo;t want it to, like, go out on the network to, you know, find the locations of other Calamity members.\nYeah. Goes dark. And is in TRAINR\u0026rsquo;s store.\nAnd I think… I rolled for the other job that I had low caliber armament and I was thinking, like, the poison– the, uh– the computer virus was part of that. But I think it would make sense that I have like a low caliber weapon with me? Like, that that was part of it? I feel like that makes sense. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I\u0026rsquo;m particularly good at using it, but I do have it… actually, I\u0026rsquo;m probably pretty good. Like, I probably do weird rich girl hobby shooting as well as, you know, being– doing wet work for the mob. The vampire mob.\nALYSSA: The Calamity is rich. Is powerful. I have every right to be here in the Gardens, and even in this apartment building above the clouds. And so I dress in my best clothes and I go and I say I have an appointment and I am on… hmm. Am I on the list or do I have to commit violence in order to get into the building itself? I rolled vigor for this, so I\u0026rsquo;m able to do what I want once I\u0026rsquo;m up there.\nYou know, I don\u0026rsquo;t go through the building. I don\u0026rsquo;t go through the lobby of the building. I don\u0026rsquo;t bother with that. I scale the outside of it up into the clouds, and that vampirism sure is helpful for not needing to breathe in thin atmosphere through the clouds.\nObviously, people see it. I think that they probably assume that it is some type of corporate publicity stunt or something. You know, weirder things have happened. No one is notified until it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nSATAH: There\u0026rsquo;s an item called Adaptskin Camouflage. \u0026ldquo;The Adaptskin mesh acts as a second skin so thin it\u0026rsquo;s barely noticeable. It is applied as an adhesive over the skin and when activated, generates a camouflage by reading and reproducing the environment.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is 32 credits. I have 10 credits. I\u0026rsquo;m going to attempt… [Laughing] to steal some credits right now.\nThe thing is with TRAINR… TRAINR is my contact. They\u0026rsquo;re reliable. They don\u0026rsquo;t do loans… to me, because… ooh, why is it I only– I only have 10 credits because I logged off of Calamitynet. You know? Like, I don\u0026rsquo;t– I don\u0026rsquo;t have the charge card. I only have the, like, physical credit thing that I have on me, which I never use, because why would I? I have the infinite resources of the clan, usually. Um… oh, I like that. I\u0026rsquo;m– I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I had, like– ended up logging off and having like a reason to only have limited funds.\nBut yeah, TRAINR knows that I have the money and so usually won\u0026rsquo;t lend me things. I am good for it, so they know that I would pay them back, but also they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Why the fuck would I wait for you to pay me? I know that you have it.\u0026rdquo; I just don\u0026rsquo;t happen to at the moment… but I could.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll… [Laughing] I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll to steal money– am I stealing it from TRAINR? No. So I know that the traitor, Dax Nocturne, is currently under the knife. Is currently getting surgery from TRAINR to install her, uh, new set of gnarly fangs. I know that\u0026rsquo;s true. And so I am going to try and, like– she has, like, her phone on her or whatever? I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to just, like, as she\u0026rsquo;s sedated especially, hack in and take some money from her to buy some camouflage tech.\nI\u0026rsquo;m actually going to give myself advantage here because Dax was a member of Calamity. And so I\u0026rsquo;m like, I can bet on her not having changed her password or something. Or like, I know the systems. Like, I can… try and get around her like security code because I can get into her authenticator or whatever. You know? Yeah. I\u0026rsquo;m just– I\u0026rsquo;m going to give myself an advantage, which means I can add a die to the attribute tested and gain a fury, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t spent any fury. So that is alright.\nSo that puts me up to 4d6. I would like to roll a five. [Dice rolling] I rolled two fours… [Dice rolling] and I rolled a four and a two. [Laughing] Fuck me. Oh my god. Okay.\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll for failure. Six: tolerable failure. No consequence. Good! I\u0026rsquo;m fine.\nMATT: So I said we were on the skyway. So I think it makes sense to get off the skyway in a different part of the city. So I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll the Book of Fate for location again and see where. we get off the train.\nFive this time. \u0026ldquo;Desperados. War debris inhabited by mutants, cyborgs, petty criminals, renegades, and recluses.\u0026rdquo; Alright. There\u0026rsquo;ll be somebody to talk to there for sure.\nWhat else do we have here? I was thinking about one of the paragraphs of setting information about the City of Angels, Belona, is… it\u0026rsquo;s got a big, you know- it\u0026rsquo;s, like, corporate high rises and, you know, all financial trading and stuff like that. But there\u0026rsquo;s a mirror image of the city in the digital realm. And I think I would like to explore some of that as well.\nSo I think perhaps in this war debris, and inhabited by mutants and cyborgs, I think they still have Internet cafes. And I think Imperius is going to get on the Internet and go checking out some of those places on the internet that are on the network that might be… you know… what kind of trails can be left there.\nAnd I feel like that will be a challenge. I think I gotta roll Trauma again because that\u0026rsquo;s the hacking one, so let\u0026rsquo;s see. That\u0026rsquo;s 2d6. What do I want to make my wager… and- and I think the wager is, like, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to find something, but I think maybe even more important than finding something is not being found myself, because now I\u0026rsquo;m into this other, you know, internal strife of some sort.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been rolling a lot of low rolls. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll two. Two is my wager here. [Dice rolling, hard sigh] Five and a three, so that is a failure. So now I roll… [Die rolling] two. \u0026ldquo;Failure with punishing consequences.\u0026rdquo; Okay. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s obvious. If I\u0026rsquo;ve set my wager or stakes at not being caught, then I\u0026rsquo;m going to get caught as part of this and maybe some aftermath of the encounter with Enlightened that I described in the last log. Um…\nSATAH: So I don\u0026rsquo;t get the money… [Laughing] but it\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nI think that genuinely what it is is just that I get into the account fine; the failure is that Dax already spent all of their money on these new fangs. I hack into an empty bank account.\nOkay. Boy. So I do think, like, having taken the time to try and… [Laughs] the thing I was going to say is, \u0026ldquo;do this the legit way,\u0026rdquo; which– I was going to steal money to legitimately buy something. It\u0026rsquo;s complicated!\nI think that, like, the private security that was eyeing me before is starting to, like… they don\u0026rsquo;t know I\u0026rsquo;m in here, but they know that, like, they were brought to this general area. And I\u0026rsquo;m looking out and there\u0026rsquo;s, like, more of them now.\nHow many are there? I\u0026rsquo;m rolling a d6. One. There\u0026rsquo;s one more. [Laughs] Um… but that\u0026rsquo;s worrying enough that they\u0026rsquo;re, like, calling in other people.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s now– there\u0026rsquo;s the person who was looking around. There\u0026rsquo;s a second one. They\u0026rsquo;re talking right outside of TRAINRs.\nI… I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna steal. Like, TRAINR is in surgery. I was gonna buy this camouflage. I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna assume I\u0026rsquo;m gonna be able to make it up to them later. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I need to roll to do this because no one is watching me. I was just left here, you know? I\u0026rsquo;m gonna steal it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna steal this Adaptskin Camouflage and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try and sneak past these guards that are outside.\nMATT: I think maybe… it\u0026rsquo;s not a random roll table, but there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of cyberware. Two of the six sections in the Book of Fate are cyberware. So maybe one of these can inspire something.\nI was thinking about this Adaptskin Camouflage.\nSATAH: The Adaptskin gives me 2d6 to Vigor rolls, which are, like, the physical prowess.\nMATT: You know, second skin, barely noticeable, adhesive camouflage.\nSATAH: It generates camouflage– oh, right! So it\u0026rsquo;s not a disguise. It\u0026rsquo;s just camouflage. Perfect. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to straight up roll to try and sneak past them.\nMATT: Real cool cyber stuff.\nSATAH: I have a one in Vigor, plus the Adaptskin is 3d6. And I would like to roll, again, a one. Small. Being small, being unnoticeable. [Dice rolling] Jesus christ. [Laughs]\nMATT: So maybe there is some sort of, um… interaction involving that. Is this going to be an assassin? Is this going to be a casual encounter?\nMaybe this becomes a goal, right? It costs 32 credits, and I have marked down that I have 9 credits because I bought that drink. So then that might become the next step of the mission.\nAdaptskin Camouflage doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound totally right. So maybe it\u0026rsquo;s intrusive in the sense of the algorithm of the network is monitoring and these secretive actions that he\u0026rsquo;s trying to do then attract the attention of ads. \u0026ldquo;Hey, you look like you\u0026rsquo;re trying to be secretive. Would you like to buy some Adaptskin Camouflage?\u0026rdquo; I think that is then what causes him to exit the network. I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s, uh– let\u0026rsquo;s roll for failure. [Die rolling] Four. \u0026ldquo;Tolerable failure, negative consequence.\u0026rdquo; Yeah, okay. There is a consequence, but it\u0026rsquo;s the least bad one.\nMm… okay, well, I have, no, because I have to fail at the thing, so I don\u0026rsquo;t sneak by them.\nMATT: I don\u0026rsquo;t know how I\u0026rsquo;ve made a vampire that\u0026rsquo;s so inept, and– I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nSATAH: TRAINR has some sort of automated system, or they were keeping an eye on the security camera, and they saw me steal, and so they come running out. I haven\u0026rsquo;t left yet. I\u0026rsquo;m still sort of, like– I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m trying to keep an eye– I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that, like, I can wait to the last possible moment to maybe learn more– to, like, figure out how much they know. And while I\u0026rsquo;m doing that, TRAINR comes out, still, like, you know, suited up, uh, with- with blood on them. Not, like, a lot a lot, but some.\nAnd they actually come out to yell at the guards. They\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Hey! I just watched somebody fucking openly steal from my store while you two idiots are just sitting here. What is the point of you? Why does some of my commission– why does some of my Tower commission go to your fucking salaries?\u0026rdquo; and so… I\u0026rsquo;m still hidden here, but I am– I didn\u0026rsquo;t get out, and I\u0026rsquo;m probably more trapped than I was before, because I bet TRAINR knows how to spot this.\nThough I think, before I decide that, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try one more time to sneak by again. The guards are trying to explain, like, \u0026ldquo;We have another situation,\u0026rdquo; and TRAINR\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t fucking care,\u0026rdquo; and they\u0026rsquo;re just yelling and yelling and yelling.\nI was gonna give myself a disadvantage because I\u0026rsquo;m using equipment that TRAINR would be familiar with, but then I also was gonna maybe give myself advantage because they are so distracted in the fight that, like, I might be able to sneak by? But I think… that equals out. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to roll the straight 3d6, which is my Vigor plus the Adaptskin, which I do still have on.\n3d6… [Pained sigh] I would like to roll a one. [Dice rolling] Oh my god! I did it! I rolled two threes and a one!! Oh my god!\nALYSSA: So I physically scale the side of this giant skyscraper, up into the unit that I know belongs to Brahm. And I break through the windows and I wait.\nAnd when eventually ze returns home, we fight it out.\nUm, I believe that there are rules specifically for fights. So it says, \u0026ldquo;To resolve a combat, use the same system, rolling for hit and wound.\u0026rdquo;\nI am going to say that because I got the Vigor success, I am successful in my challenge, but I will roll to see if I take damage as well. And it says using the same rules, so I\u0026rsquo;m just going to roll the three dice again. I will call two and three… no. I\u0026rsquo;ll just call two this time.\n[Dice rolling] Which I do not have! I rolled a one, a six, and a five, so I think that I am going to take damage in this fight.\nMATT: All right. There\u0026rsquo;s my three beats. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna write up my journal.\nSATAH: Baby\u0026rsquo;s first success. Can you even imagine? I also rolled it, like, the one, like– the die that has the one on it, slipped out of sight behind something, and so that was very suspenseful.\nMy god. The fuck do I do if I succeed? I guess I just succeed. Yeah, I managed to sneak past. Whoa. [Laughs]\nAnd, uh… yeah, I mean I\u0026rsquo;m still being privately tracked by the Hoshi people, so I know it\u0026rsquo;s not forever, but I do at least manage to get past here and I think…\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna go- I\u0026rsquo;m gonna get on that stupidly long elevator. On the way down, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try and disable the tracker again. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a good idea, but Speck will not let it go.\nSo this is T plus disadvantage, because again, Hoshi people are really good hackers, and that is a 2d6. I would like to roll a three… [Dice rolling] six and a five. [Laughing] Okay.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Log 003. The Praug file. Plus.\nI rode the skyway all the way out to the Desperados. The end of the Silian line. I\u0026rsquo;ve been out here before, but it\u0026rsquo;s been a while. I\u0026rsquo;m so used to the rises and the hall and the workroom…. this is all still debris.\nIt looks the same. Same lights that are both harsh and too dim. Same scent of all the Zega rays that tore the armies apart. It\u0026rsquo;s all hardened now. Like, before, the piles of rubble looked temporary, like they might be cleaned up at any time. Now they seem cemented over with new signboards in place. It\u0026rsquo;s just the landscape now.\nI paid for a booth in a jack parlour. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use their equipment, though; just wanted a place with a door so I could sit down and get on the network for my own signal. It\u0026rsquo;s all so bright out here on the other side. Brighter than the network rises. It\u0026rsquo;s like banishing the night entirely.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what I expected. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d just find Miss Praug sitting there at the fountain when I stepped out of the parlour.\nI visited the local branches of some of the new religions and conspiracy cults. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see any mention of the names concerned.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some anti-Calamity sentiment out here. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised. But sort of short of specific clan clubs, no rival stood out to me as particularly worth noticing. The only thing that\u0026rsquo;s even a hint of a clue is a patent code sales rep talking about editing your own hardware to be untraceable. If the Praetor can\u0026rsquo;t find Miss Praug, she must be doing something to hide herself.\nI listened, but I\u0026rsquo;m not about to have a serious conversation with a Rule 63 John Brown. Still, there\u0026rsquo;s something there. A child and sh– sire can always locate each other. So is Prog not\nMATT, INTERRUPTING AS A POP-UP AD: Hey there, pal.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Oh no.\nMATT, AS THE POP-UP AD: You look like the sort of person who has some secrets.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: No–\nMATT, AS THE POP-UP AD: We all have secrets.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Close!\nMATT, AS THE POP-UP AD: But you\u0026rsquo;re out here doing something about it.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Deny–\nMATT, AS THE POP-UP AD: I like that about you. But I gotta say, you do kinda stick out.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Unsubscribe! [Heavy sigh]\nMATT, AS THE POP-UP AD: That suit\u0026rsquo;s too clean for this part of the city. Take it from a guy like me.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Unskippable?!\nMATT, AS THE POP-UP AD: What you could use is Adaptskin camouflage. It\u0026rsquo;s an adhesive second skin, so you can totally still floss while wearing it.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Stop following me… I don\u0026rsquo;t want this!!\nMATT, AS THE POP-UP AD: The mesh constantly monitors your position and generates video imagery to match. You\u0026rsquo;re guaranteed to be 16 % more stealthy than your current cape and cap ensemble.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Leave me alone!\nMATT, AS THE POP-UP AD: That\u0026rsquo;s right. For only 32 credits, the Adapt Skin Camouflage can be yours. And payment plans are available.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: What?! Ugh– end log.\nALYSSA: So I break through this window, and an alarm immediately starts going off, obviously. It is bad in your high altitude condo for windows to be shattering. So any sort of element of surprise that I might have hoped for is immediately lost.\nAnd he may be an apprentice, but Brahm is still an apprentice to the best, and a vampire hunter in his own right.\nSo he comes at me, weapons at the ready. And in order to make my climb easier and less suspicious, I am fully unarmed. I mean, what weapons do I need when my body and my things are a weapon, right? Except then there\u0026rsquo;s a man coming at you with a gun and a flamethrower, and suddenly the idea of having armor, having weapons, seems a lot more appealing.\nBut I am able to take him down, I think just guided by pure animal rage versus his confusion at being targeted in his own home. That\u0026rsquo;s not the way that things work in this city. There are rules of engagement that are followed, typically, even among the vampire clans, and especially, you would think, from the Calamity, who value honour above all else.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m not following those rules. I am not tethering myself to them anymore.\nMATT: I feel the mission creep of this, uh- of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing here. You know, record a actual– play a game, play a solo game. Great, I can do that. Record it while you think about it. Yeah, I can do that. But now it\u0026rsquo;s, like, audio logs, and I\u0026rsquo;m trying to create some sort of verisimilitude and I\u0026rsquo;m aware as I\u0026rsquo;m writing that I\u0026rsquo;m going to be performing this in a second. I don\u0026rsquo;t think anything– I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s bad or wrong for this context, but it is, um… I\u0026rsquo;m aware of it. It\u0026rsquo;s a real ouroboros sort of situation here. And I would like to tone down the… the performing side of this. This is a journaling game and I want to journal and not have to fact check my jokes before I, um make them– before I read them to- for an audience. Um, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see if I\u0026rsquo;m able to to succeed at that or not.\nSATAH: Gonna roll for my failure… [Die rolling] three, \u0026ldquo;failure, punishing consequence.\u0026rdquo; Goddammit, yeah– luckily, I know exactly what this is.\nMATT: Alright. Log four, um. I\u0026rsquo;m coming into this one knowing pretty much exactly what I want to happen; I just have to roll it.\nSo, we ended the last log with, uh, Imperius still in the network, being accosted by advertising, and so I think he has to log out and I think he\u0026rsquo;s going to buy some adrenaline, because that\u0026rsquo;s the thing I can do with some of my currency, and it\u0026rsquo;s going to add to my… give me a bonus on Vigor, right, which is the physical prowess. So it\u0026rsquo;ll add– I\u0026rsquo;ll have 1D6 Vigor instead of one Vigor, which I think will be very helpful in a fight.\nBecause what I think is going to happen next is I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to fight. And so I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll now to see, you know– this is… somebody\u0026rsquo;s caught up to me. Somebody who doesn\u0026rsquo;t want me looking into things is going to find me. So I think all of that is going to happen.\nSATAH: I got in the elevator and I was like… I think it\u0026rsquo;s like I got in the elevator. I was just going to try and get out, but got antsy about the tracker in that long elevator ride and tried to disable it again.\nAnd the punishing consequence is that the elevator car that I\u0026rsquo;m in just stops.\nI\u0026rsquo;m, like, doing my hacking thing and my, like, inlaid over– the overlay that I\u0026rsquo;m looking at just shorts out, and at the same time, the power in the elevator flickers and it starts to slow down. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a very, very fast elevator, despite it being very long, and so it can\u0026rsquo;t stop immediately, but it is slowing down on the tracks.\nAnd it slows and slows and stops, and the doors open. I still have the Adaptskin on. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and, like, hide against the wall of the elevator so when the doors open, whoever\u0026rsquo;s there, like, if they just shoot or whatever, they don\u0026rsquo;t get me, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and, like… run past them. This is assuming that someone\u0026rsquo;s there, and I- there- there certainly ism because this was a punishing consequence.\nLet me see- let me see how many people are there. I\u0026rsquo;m actually gonna roll the threats to see who exactly it is… no, because it should be– it should just be somebody from Hoshi, so I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna roll, like, how many. [Die rolling] Two. Okay!\nMATT: Let me make sure I get the look at the adrenaline here… it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a one -time use thing, but it\u0026rsquo;s going to turn my vigor into 1d6 vigor. [Die rolling] Four. Alright, that\u0026rsquo;s much better.\nSo then I get to roll four dice in this fight. And I think what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to spend a Fury as well to pick two numbers. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to pick two and five? Is that good? Two and five, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll four dice.\n[Dice rolling] Alright. I got one five, which means I succeeded at the fight, which means I\u0026rsquo;m not going to end up having to roll for terrible failure, which is great. I\u0026rsquo;m very, very happy about that.\nSATAH: So there are these two Hoshi agents. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll to try and get past them. Like, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m pressed against the elevator wall. The doors open and they\u0026rsquo;re there and they\u0026rsquo;re confused because they don\u0026rsquo;t see anybody immediately, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and get past them.\nSo my vigor plus the Adaptskin is 3d6… is that everything? Yeah. I would like to roll a six. [Dice rolling] I did! I rolled two ones and a six. My god! Great. So! Okay! Wow! Still not used to success. I managed to get by them. That\u0026rsquo;s great.\nMATT: And so the last roll that I\u0026rsquo;m making in this little section is I\u0026rsquo;m gonna learn… I want to learn something about the clan- who the rival clan is that\u0026rsquo;s involved here. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to learn- take away from the fight. I rolled a one, which is Calamity. I kind of was hoping for one of the others because it would be more, more… but that\u0026rsquo;s what I rolled. So I think this is an entirely internecine fight then. At least for these people who are beating me up, or trying to because I failed. I fought them with my adrenaline– my adrenaline boost.\nSATAH: So I sneak by them. And I think… I, you know, I- I- I\u0026rsquo;m still really high up. These towers are so big. And I got, let\u0026rsquo;s say– let me– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna- I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll to see how far down I got. So like, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna say that they\u0026rsquo;re percentages. If I roll a six, I got 60 % of the way down. That\u0026rsquo;s the– that\u0026rsquo;s the most amount that I could have gotten down. And so like five is 50, whatever.\n[Die rolling] Two. Only 20% of the way down. That\u0026rsquo;s too bad! I didn\u0026rsquo;t get that far at all.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m like, okay, so I can\u0026rsquo;t do the elevator right now. Let\u0026rsquo;s look for the stairs.\nALYSSA: I attack him in his home and I kill him. And with the sound of the alarms blaring, I rip out his canines to send to the vampire hunter himself, um, if they don\u0026rsquo;t get here soon, because again, apartment alarm system… probably some special vampire hunter alarm system things happening?\nAnd I really need to get out. And in the fight, I was wounded. I think he got in a good shot through my shoulder, not the cybernetic one. And I am bleeding and certainly can\u0026rsquo;t take the elevators down the building, and also, am probably physically incapable of scaling down the walls in this state.\nSo I need to come up with a new plan for exit.\nMATT: Log 004. The Praug file.\n[Panting] Okay. I\u0026rsquo;m really in it now.\nI could feel them coming. Once the network started targeting pals on me, Lictor Canossus was on her way. Cut the connection and walked out of the parlour. There was just enough time to get an adrenaline shot from the slot shop. I took it and went across the street to a guy who was selling steel slag under a \u0026ldquo;Zega Rays Don\u0026rsquo;t Melt Steel Beams\u0026rdquo; sign. I grabbed the biggest one I could find.\nAnd about right then, Canossus landed on her grav boots.\nI was hitting the peak of the shot. She tried something with that energy claw of hers, but I smashed it into the ground. And then I hit her with it. Shoulder… neck… head… she\u0026rsquo;s got a lot of reinforcing. She didn\u0026rsquo;t fall down easily. I just kept swinging the piece of steel until she did fall down.\nI tossed away the slag. I got down beside her. Asked her who she was really after.\nShe had alarms going off all over. Repairs already in progress. \u0026ldquo;Calamity will bear no kings.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s all she said before her backups put her out.\nThere were people watching. I got up and left. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if she\u0026rsquo;ll survive the scrappers. But no one stopped me as I left.\nI\u0026rsquo;m walking back along the cyan line. Running, mostly. I gotta keep ahead of the dawn. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot wilder between the tram stops.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to stop. Not here. Not for long.\n\u0026ldquo;Calamity will bear no kings.\u0026rdquo; Does she think someone would claim that ancient title? Is that what the Praetors are feuding about? Who even has that much sway? All the Praetors kind of hate each other, but they\u0026rsquo;re all pretty balanced… right? What would Miss Praug have to do with any of that?\nGotta keep moving.\nEnd log.\nSATAH: I think finding the stairs should be relatively easy, so that isn\u0026rsquo;t really a challenge, but… what is- what is my next move? I know that I\u0026rsquo;m being tracked. Yeah. I go down the stairs, and as I\u0026rsquo;m running, I hear footsteps on the stairs above me, like chasing after me.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to track this- the tower. So what did I say? I got 20% of the way down? I\u0026rsquo;m making- I\u0026rsquo;m making myself a clock that is, \u0026ldquo;Escape the tower.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s got 10 ticks and I need to get all the way down.\nSo- so I hear these footsteps above me and at a certain point I hear footsteps below me coming up as well. And that\u0026rsquo;s going to force me to go into the hall. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll another d6 to see how– at, like– do the same thing of like one is 10%, two is 20% to see how much farther down the tower I got.\n[Die rolling] Another two. Not bad. Not great, but not terrible.\nALYSSA: I think that my plan is… oof. Unfortunately, I think that my plan is via hacking and attempting to trick the alarms into thinking that this was a technological misfire, not something for the building to check out.\nSo! I– that means I am rolling a stat in which I have zero die, zero points. The way that I\u0026rsquo;m going to attempt to resolve this is like Blades in the Dark, I think, so basically rolling at disadvantage, which means that I would need both of my dice to show up as a wagered number because I will be discarding one of them if one of them is a hit. So I need two hits, basically, in order to succeed, which gives me a better chance than if I was not rolling at all and took an auto failure, but it\u0026rsquo;s still not super likely.\nTo increase the likelihood of success, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and burn another Fury so that I am able to wager on two numbers. I\u0026rsquo;ve been getting fives lately, so I\u0026rsquo;ll keep a five. And this time we will go with a one. So I want a one and a five on these dice in order to sort of hack my way into the apartment complex security system and disable at least the building alarms, if not whatever protections that Brahm had for the vampire hunter themselves.\n[Dice rolling] Okay! That is a one and a three. Unfortunately, that means I fail because I got one hit, but I needed two. So! I can now roll a d6 to determine the level of my failure. [Die rolling] And that is a five, which is a, shockingly, a \u0026ldquo;tolerable failure with no consequence.\u0026rdquo; So.\nSATAH: So I get another 20% of the way down the tower, and then the footsteps above me are joined by footsteps below me, and I\u0026rsquo;m forced to, like, duck out of the stairwell back into, like, one of the main hallways, the main floor.\nAnd I think I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to roll on the location lists… not to get a whole new location, but just to see what the vibe of this floor of the tower is.\n[Die rolling] Three. \u0026ldquo;Dock warehouses: no man\u0026rsquo;s land, one of the city\u0026rsquo;s most dangerous areas.\u0026rdquo; [Laughing] Okay, good!\nI mean, yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s– these towers are so big that, like, you can\u0026rsquo;t store everything in one place, right? It\u0026rsquo;s, like, every 10 or 20 floors, there is a warehouse. And it\u0026rsquo;s weird because like– I think they\u0026rsquo;re not accessible by just the regular elevator that I was in, right? Like, they\u0026rsquo;d be accessible by like a freight elevator, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been in one of these really, and it\u0026rsquo;s only because I was in the stairwell that I burst out into this.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s weird as fuck because it is just open. I, like, burst out the door or– quietly, trying not to slam the door so that they don\u0026rsquo;t know where I went– and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that, like, they\u0026rsquo;ll confuse each other\u0026rsquo;s footsteps for me and it\u0026rsquo;ll give me some time? Which I might roll on in a second.\nI expect to burst out into, like, a hall or like, you know, a mall that has– it\u0026rsquo;s like a mall that has a thoroughfare, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty closed in. But this is just, like, a whole floor that is a warehouse, that is open, has these huge shelves. And it\u0026rsquo;s dark. It\u0026rsquo;s just like shitty lighting.\nAnd it is dangerous. And the reason it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous is because– or one of the reasons it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous is because a lot of the warehousing is done with, like, digital sensors? A store can say, \u0026ldquo;Oh, we need this item,\u0026rdquo; and scan a code and then there are little, like, just droids down here. Non-sentient or sapient droids that just go over and automatically pick up the boxes and that kind of thing, and that means there are like… not- not cameras, probably… I think actually explicitly there aren\u0026rsquo;t cameras because people don\u0026rsquo;t want you to just be able to, like, look at their merchandise. They\u0026rsquo;re super paranoid about that. But there are just, like, sensors for, like, weight everywhere, like– there\u0026rsquo;s a box here; there\u0026rsquo;s not a box here. And there\u0026rsquo;s all these droids, and, like, there are security features just because… theft. They\u0026rsquo;re worried about theft. So it\u0026rsquo;s not dangerous necessarily because of, like, people, but just because of security measures.\nUm… I am going to roll to see if I managed to… no. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to roll to see if I managed to shut the door quietly enough, because I think like I\u0026rsquo;m on a timer anyway. Like, they\u0026rsquo;re- they\u0026rsquo;re tracking me. They- they might be confused temporarily, but, like, ultimately they will still be able to find me no matter what, and so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. I try my best, but ultimately, like, I\u0026rsquo;m fucked, so this- this particular success or failure doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter particul- like, a lot.\nSo I think I want to do two things. I want to try and set it up so that some of the security measures- the warehouse security measures will work for me, rather than against me, by, like, defending me from any of the people who managed to find me here.\nAnd I want to find the freight elevator. As I was talking about it, I was like, oh shit, that would be awesome. Like, if I could find the freight elevator, that seems like I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get out more easily– like I wonder if it can, like, sort of express get down, you know?\nSo I think the first thing I\u0026rsquo;m going to do– I\u0026rsquo;m like, looking, around this warehouse, I\u0026rsquo;m walking around, I\u0026rsquo;m noting when droids start to like light up, when the little eye icon appears above them to be like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to notice you,\u0026rdquo; and the sensor starts to fill up for when my stealth has failed. I\u0026rsquo;m just like, as I\u0026rsquo;m running through trying to test all this stuff, and I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to try… and hack… to like… yeah, just make it so anybody who comes in behind me will be targeted. I doubt that it would like attack them, but there\u0026rsquo;s almost– there\u0026rsquo;s gotta be like a system to detain potential thieves, right?\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try and do a little hacking to do that. So I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll for that. I think this is just 3d6… this is my- my T stat… do I have advantage or disadvantage? Not particularly. I think if I weren\u0026rsquo;t a rich asshole, I would maybe give myself advantage here for, like, having worked in the towers. Like, I worked at the mall and so I know how it works. But… like, theoretically, I do know that because I\u0026rsquo;ve stolen. But I think honestly, like I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m from a rich clan. Like, I might steal for thrill, but probably not from the mall? Probably not from the Towers. Otherwise, like I think that Speck enjoys flexing having the money to spend more than she enjoys the thrill of theft.\nSo yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll 3d6 and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna spend a fury to add another number to my wager. So I\u0026rsquo;m at four out of five fury. I\u0026rsquo;ve got 3d6. I would like to roll a three or a five. Those are good numbers and I\u0026rsquo;m doing really well at that so far. So. [Dice rolling] Oh my god yes. Okay. I rolled a four, a two, and a three.\nMATT: Unlike yesterday, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear sense of what I\u0026rsquo;m about to do. I think it\u0026rsquo;s too… I don\u0026rsquo;t think Imperius knows enough to, like, go back to the Calamity Hall and confront anyone there. I think he\u0026rsquo;s got to go somewhere else, so maybe he got a list.\nI said in the first entry that he had a list of Miss Praug\u0026rsquo;s friends, and so… I only went to one, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to look at the list again and see who else I might be able to talk to, and I think that means I\u0026rsquo;ve got to go to the Book of Fate, and I think I\u0026rsquo;ve got to generate another NPC.\n[Die rolling] So this person is an adult. [Die rolling] Is also in Calamity. And their disposition will be… [Die rolling] violent. And let\u0026rsquo;s find out where this person is. [Die rolling] The Gardens. \u0026ldquo;Upscale part of the city, skyscrapers as far as the eye can see, luxurious residences above the clouds.\u0026rdquo;\nALYSSA: I attempt to hack into this man\u0026rsquo;s security system. I am not a hacker. This is not my wheelhouse. This was Ayla\u0026rsquo;s part of the job, but Ayla is no longer here. So I\u0026rsquo;m able to pull some protocols from her, but I really don\u0026rsquo;t know how they work. or how to finesse them, and so I\u0026rsquo;m able to, I think, silence the blaring alarm itself in the unit, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop any of the sort of systems from being alerted, and suddenly there are, I think, iron shades rolling down the windows and the building is in lockdown. Uh, so… I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a direct punishment, um– I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be able to go out the window anyway, but I have certainly not stopped the security from, uh, sort of continuing into its next stages.\nAnd so I think my next approach is just going down the elevator, down to the lobby and hoping that I\u0026rsquo;m not stopped, and… if I am stopped, just fighting my way out of it.\nMATT: So I think this is a contact, then… someone that Imperius knows, but… they are not going to be happy to see him because they\u0026rsquo;ve, uh… they\u0026rsquo;re at the top of the game, right? And living in the Gardens and having fresh from a throwdown Imperius show up right as dawn breaks at their doorstep is not a situation that they want to be put in, I think.\nBut then maybe… I think I have to roll a wager again to see what kind of information I get out of this person. Even though it\u0026rsquo;s the same number, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll insight this time, like- how much can I take from the conversation? Like, what is this person saying by what they\u0026rsquo;re not saying in the conversation? So that\u0026rsquo;ll be 2d6. Do I want to spend Fury on this? I think I have to, because I really need a clue, some direction. Um… I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go with… let\u0026rsquo;s do it. One and six. One and six, spending a Fury. 2d6 for my insight.\n[Dice rolling] I rolled double fours, which is a failure. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how bad of a failure. [Die rolling] Three. More punishing consequences. Okay.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve said more than they\u0026rsquo;ve said… I think this person is, then, part of the conspiracy and the punishing consequence is… something… is it getting captured? Is it just having to flee again? I\u0026rsquo;m not decided on that. Let me see what I come up with when I write.\nSATAH: So I successfully hack this security, and I think I like the idea that this is, like, just in the nick of time. I\u0026rsquo;m doing this hacking and like just as I finish sending in some commands, the door opens. They even spot me. Like, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, right? They know where I am, so they even spot me, and as we make eye contact, a warehouse security droid is like, \u0026ldquo;Thief, we will detain you until,\u0026rdquo; blah blah blah blah blah, uh… \u0026ldquo;this merchandise is owned by the fucking Gap. Get your ass out of here.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s right. Security droids swear. They\u0026rsquo;re cool now.\nAnd so they see me, but a few of them– how many of them burst into this warehouse? Rollin\u0026rsquo; my d6… [Die rolling] three… there were two groups of them, so rolling another one… [Die rolling] six. Oof. Nine. Yeah. So there are nine guards, or nine, uh– nine, um– ooh, maybe three of them are the- the Tower security and the six are, like, Hoshi agents. Should probably flip that. Yeah. Six tower security, three Hoshi agents.\nI think Tower security hasn\u0026rsquo;t been told exactly, like, you know– they are security. Like, the Hoshi agents are security. They\u0026rsquo;re network security. And there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of a, like– they\u0026rsquo;re posturing at each other of, like, whose domain this is, \u0026lsquo;cause we\u0026rsquo;re in the physical realm. And so Tower security is like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, this is us,\u0026rdquo; and the Hoshi agents are like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, but this is also about digital. Like this is– this- this- this is bigger than you, actually, so get out of our fucking way.\u0026rdquo; And uh… and yeah, they\u0026rsquo;ve all been detained and I am running to this freight elevator.\nDo I need to roll to get the freight elevator moving? No, I feel like there\u0026rsquo;s probably something I can just, like… like, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a clearance, but it would make sense that I had, like, managed to get that in my roll to hack the security, right? The question is like, again, how far down can I get? [Laughs]\nUm… is that the question? What do I want here? What\u0026rsquo;s- what\u0026rsquo;s fun here? I\u0026rsquo;m in the freight elevator…\nYeah, I think I want to be able to– I think it\u0026rsquo;s most fun if I get it moving. I am going to have to roll to see if they can overcome the hacking I did of the security. Because if they can, like, get to the panel, they can certainly stop the freight elevator, right?\nIs this hacking roll? Or is this… what is this? Let me think about this.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Log 005. The Praug file.\nAm I making progress?\nI got back on the skyway and took another look at the names Halicarnassus gave me. There\u0026rsquo;s only one person that I know. Well, kind of know. Knew.\nVirtuous Abydos. He\u0026rsquo;s a friend of the clan, but he\u0026rsquo;s gone for the double life, posing as a human in the world of business. He has a flat in the Gardens. I dropped in.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t want to see me, of course, but it was almost sun-up, plus we\u0026rsquo;re old pals. He still looks right in the prime of life, and he has all the finer things. Business. He makes chips. He let me crash in the guest room for the day. I slept like a stone. If he wanted to throw me out a window, he could have done it then.\nWhen I woke up, I skimmed the network… anonymous mode. Just a quick dip in. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing too nasty searching for me.\nOnce it was night, Virt and I had a talk. I had to hear a bunch about how he\u0026rsquo;s unaligned and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t need anyone coming along to try to drag him into this… what \u0026ldquo;this\u0026rdquo;? He backtracked. It was all about the humans and how he couldn\u0026rsquo;t have the nightlife disrupting his operations.\nI tried to put Halocarnassus into the mix. I\u0026rsquo;m here on assignment from the Praetor. He sent me to you.\nHe was very uncomfortable with my questions.\nSomething made me ask if Miss Praug was in the other guest room. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that was the right question or a very wrong question, but it was the end of the interview. He threw me out, right over the balcony.\nHe might be living the day life, but he gets to feed regularly. He didn\u0026rsquo;t even struggle with tossing me over. The good news is I had time to appreciate the Gardens from a whole new perspective before I hit the street!\nWell, obviously, I- I must have landed in something that was softer than the actual street. But I woke up here in the undercity. I was in a recycle bin that was about equal parts e-waste and fish guts, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m even under the Gardens.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s only been a few hours, though. No one else is down here. No one is supposed to be down here. It\u0026rsquo;s all automated. I\u0026rsquo;m on level 10! I\u0026rsquo;ve only seen one door, and it was locked.\nObviously, Virt knows more than he said. I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to think all the people on this list are just Holocarnassus\u0026rsquo; enemies. Maybe he is making stuff up to get them censured? Why would the clan be investigating if there wasn\u0026rsquo;t something to investigate?\nI just feel really bad at this. He must have known that. Am I just supposed to stir people up? So he can… what?\nDid Virt have Charitable there? I thought I heard music.\nEnd log.\nALYSSA: I am going to roll with Vigor because I think that there aren\u0026rsquo;t people in the hallways, really. I think I have to physically break down the door in order to get out of Brahm\u0026rsquo;s unit, and everyone else is sort of trapped inside their own units as well.\nAnd, you know… elevator\u0026rsquo;s probably locked down. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to take however many stairs down as I\u0026rsquo;m bleeding out of my shoulder, and if I have to fight my way through the lobby and out of the building, then so be it.\nSATAH: This is me trying to maintain the hack that I already did. So this is essentially me fighting, like– they are trying to, like, counter hack and I\u0026rsquo;m trying to, like, keep them at bay.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll 3d6… I think this would be disadvantaged, because I am directly fighting in Hoshi network security agents, because that\u0026rsquo;s who\u0026rsquo;s following me, but I want to give myself advantage because– or, rather, I want to, like, cancel out that disadvantage because, like, I\u0026rsquo;m defending? You know what I mean? Like, I already- I already won. I already did this, and the thing I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do is just, like, waste their time. That- that\u0026rsquo;s part of what it is is, like, if I were trying to make this permanent, I think it would be harder but I\u0026rsquo;m not, so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna keep my 3d6, and I would like to roll… being- going really well so far, a three. [Dice rolling, pained sound] Six two four… nah.\nMATT: Hopefully you can\u0026rsquo;t hear my dishwasher going two rooms away but, uh, if you can, uh, it\u0026rsquo;s just verisimilitude for the Undercity where Imperius finds himself.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about whether or not this this whole Undercity thing, being trapped here or at least for now, is a sideline to the story and I should resolve it in one, uh, log entry, or if this should- like, being underground and possibly meeting the denizens who live below the city surface or the city streets is sort of, like, the next step in the mystery. And… I- I\u0026rsquo;m not sure which way to try to resolve that.\nI feel that… every thing is connected. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of the move to make in a in a noir-ish cyberpunk-y kind of thing and I\u0026rsquo;ve already been below the street with the, um– the original friends of Charitable, so I think there\u0026rsquo;s a possibility to, like, pick up on some of those threads again and- and meet up with some of those same people.\nBut I think there\u0026rsquo;s some physical dangers first. Do I want to roll..? I mean, no is the answer– I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to roll, uh, because this is this system is- is tough.\nALYSSA: I will roll now with Vigor and the number that I will bet on is a six. [Dice rolling] Okay! One one six, thank you!\nSo I am able to, despite my wound, um… I think sort of after breaking down Brahm\u0026rsquo;s door with my cybernetic shoulder, cybernetic arm, take a minute to sort of fasten off a little tourniquet, DIY, onto my shoulder. I mean– I\u0026rsquo;m a vampire, I assume I feel pain, and I assume that, especially from combat with a vampire hunter, I am feeling the consequences of my actions, so… tie off the shoulder wound. I think that it is starting to burn as something that was on the bullet is working its way into my system.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m still able to make my way down the many, many, many, many, many staircases of this skyscraper to the lobby.\nAnd once there… do I think they have human security? I think that human security has been alerted. That is an external force. And right now, what they\u0026rsquo;re sending through are little droids. Robots, rather than actual people, and that is easy enough for me to deal with, and I think I don\u0026rsquo;t even register, actually, as a threat to them because I\u0026rsquo;m a vampire, not a person. And so any sort of heat registering technology, that is not going to catch me, a dead body.\nSo, fortunately, I\u0026rsquo;m able to make my way down to the lobby. I, you know… there is a desk person, not a security force, just a sort of nice face to greet people as they come home, and just easy enough for a big, strong girl like me to knock them out and get out of the building without further incident.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;m looking at the Book of Fate again, just seeing what other things I can randomise. I haven\u0026rsquo;t rolled yet on the event table. What else is here that I haven\u0026rsquo;t rolled on? Threats, armament. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s just do all three of those, and that\u0026rsquo;s my three things, and we\u0026rsquo;ll see how they run together.\nAlright, so an event. [Die rolling] Four. \u0026ldquo;It was an accident. You must run against the clock.\u0026rdquo;\nThreats. Roll 1d6 for quantity as well; that\u0026rsquo;s dangerous. [Dice rolling] Five vampire hunters is what I\u0026rsquo;ve rolled. That\u0026rsquo;s, um, that\u0026rsquo;s real bad.\nAnd then what is… I think the last one is armaments. [Die rolling] Four again. \u0026ldquo;Low caliber. Just slug throwers. Pistols and revolvers. No special bullets.\u0026rdquo; Okay.\nHow to put these three things together. What have I created for myself?\nSATAH: So let\u0026rsquo;s see how badly this gets me. One. \u0026ldquo;Critical failure. Harsh punishment.\u0026rdquo;\nI know exactly what it is. Part of the way that I was… managing to maintain– like, I was- I was keeping them at bay was that, uh, I was just sending– I was making them, like, consistently re-trigger the anti-theft measures? Like, they\u0026rsquo;d get them under control and then I\u0026rsquo;d send a new alert, basically manually, and so it was just, like, in their way, and new droids kept coming over to, like, detain them and just be annoying.\nAnd, uh, the big failure here is that I sent too many threats. I pushed too hard. And a huge lockdown goes in, like, just gets enabled. An alarm sounds and the freight elevator is going to grind to a halt.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to roll to see again how far I went down– [Laughing] this is my fun new little mechanic that I\u0026rsquo;ve put in. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll with disadvantage. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take the lowest. I rolled a 4, 40%. I rolled a 3, 30%. Okay. That\u0026rsquo;s fine. I got another 30% of the way down the tower in the freight elevator. It is fast, is the thing. Uncomfortably fast. I had to, like– I was standing up and the force of it– because it\u0026rsquo;s not meant to have people in it usually? Or like there\u0026rsquo;s a setting for people that I did not put it on, and so it\u0026rsquo;s super fast, uncomfortable. I was standing up. I ended up sitting on the floor and then it stops really suddenly as well. It\u0026rsquo;s painful.\nAnd I am 70% of the way down the tower!\nMATT: I think what makes sense here… the two things that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about are going to be one and then the other, basically.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m leaning toward… Imperius is wandering about. There\u0026rsquo;s some vampire hunters. Something he\u0026rsquo;s done or, possibly been tipped off by the guy who threw him into the- into the, uh, recycle bin, um– yeah, you got the vampire hunters. And they\u0026rsquo;re coming. And they don\u0026rsquo;t want to- they want to hunt; they don\u0026rsquo;t want to kill me, which is why they\u0026rsquo;re using just pistols, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s, like, painful and slightly debilitating, uh, but not deadly. They\u0026rsquo;re not trying to kill me. They\u0026rsquo;re trying to have some fun here in the Undercity. Real nastiness.\nAnd so I gotta run. \u0026ldquo;You run against the clock.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re after me and I think… it does say it was an accident, so maybe they found me coincidentally? But I think this sideline is sort of the situation and I think I\u0026rsquo;m able to get away, but then that\u0026rsquo;s going to lead to the mystery. However I escape these people leads to the next clue, potentially. We\u0026rsquo;ll deal with that next time.\nSATAH: The freight elevator did not stop at a floor, or it didn\u0026rsquo;t stop exactly at a floor. That\u0026rsquo;s the other harsh punishment. I\u0026rsquo;m stuck.\nALYSSA: That, I think, is where I will leave my first log.\nSATAH: At this point, I think that I am admitting– Speck is admitting, that things are pretty bad. And she is going to, real quick, hop back on Calamitynet and send in a log to Klysm. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go write that down real quick; I\u0026rsquo;ll be back.\nMATT: Let me… let make a journal.\nSATAH: Okay. Before I read this log, I need to roll something to determine someone who\u0026rsquo;s in it.\nSo I was like, I want to send a log that is encrypted- that is like, you know, \u0026ldquo;If I don\u0026rsquo;t make it out of here,\u0026rdquo; type thing, and I was like, what if there\u0026rsquo;s something… there\u0026rsquo;s, like, a death encryption that we have that essentially, like… you can put things in code. The most difficult to crack code that– maybe it\u0026rsquo;s all the katas, everyone with my level and higher or whatever,w we have, like, code ciphers that are truly uncrackable until the person who sent the message dies. And I was thinking that like the cipher is installed on our fangs or, like, you know, the little– the implant that we get, the one that\u0026rsquo;s like… yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s, like, under the cheekbones and there is, like, a cipher in there that can crack this level of encryption. And so it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s a like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, if you can read this, I fucking died,\u0026rdquo; kind of thing. Um. I don\u0026rsquo;t know all the details of it, but that\u0026rsquo;s basically where I\u0026rsquo;m at. And so I\u0026rsquo;m sending something that is encrypted at that level.\nAnd I just want to roll… I want to mention a person in it. And so I just wanted to hop on-mic and figure out who that person is.\nI- I want an NPC that I\u0026rsquo;m going to mention who went into the public sector. [Laughs] Um, started working for the government in some way. And I\u0026rsquo;m just going to roll to see… if they defected from Calamity or something else. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on that NPC list again that is like, one and two are Calamity clan, three is a nomad, so I guess unaffiliated, four to six is a rival clan. Three… unaffiliated! Interesting.\nOkay. I think what that\u0026rsquo;s going to mean is that it was, um… this was actually the person who I used to– my former… Calamity\u0026rsquo;s former cyberware dealer before TRAINR who started working for the military. Like… the- the government military. [Laughs] Yeah, so…\nALYSSA: Log 001.\nMATT: Log 006.\nSATAH: Log 003, which is encrypted with my death codes, death encryption, just says, \u0026ldquo;Eyes on Hoshi. Net acquisition deal. Client reminded me of our old friend Lex.\u0026rdquo;\nALYSSA, AS TISIPHONY: A bit bloodier than I\u0026rsquo;d like, but mission accomplished. I wonder if the vampire hunter will react as well as I did, opening a package of his protege\u0026rsquo;s teeth.\nI hope he will. I\u0026rsquo;m betting on it.\nSATAH: You know, basically just saying, like, \u0026ldquo;Remember how we had somebody we could rely on, or at least reliably manipulate, who is no longer under our control because they started working for the government? Yeah. Look into what Hoshi\u0026rsquo;s doing with the \u0026rsquo;net and, uh… with that in mind!\u0026rdquo; is the message I\u0026rsquo;m going to send.\nALYSSA: And I think that\u0026rsquo;s it. Just a little short and sweet message to the ether, to her love, letting them know that revenge is coming.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Julius H. Caesar, why? What is happening?\nI wandered, and the only routes I found in the machines were trending down. I\u0026rsquo;ve been down here a while. Eventually I found an air shaft, and I climbed up, just to get closer to the streets. But that was a mistake, or something, because I met some hunters. Down here! Waiting for me? Already tracking me? Did someone send them?\nI think there are five of them. They were armored, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t use anything too nasty. They were just picking at me with small arms fire. It still hurts to get hit with bullets.\nIf they wanted me dead, I have no doubt I would be. They want to chase me. Just good old time fashion hunters out for a weekend fun.\nAt least these levels are more open. I think I\u0026rsquo;m up to 12 or 14 now?\nThey always move together, but if I can get one alone for just a moment, then I\u0026rsquo;ll do what vampires do.\nEnd log.\nALYSSA: I do have a pretty nasty shoulder wound, and it\u0026rsquo;s only getting worse as the night progresses. And so I think that, unfortunately, my next step has to be to go to a doctor.\nMATT: I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it matters, but I have been recording one log a day during this process. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of how I like to play a solo game, making one entry and thinking about it.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the situation that I\u0026rsquo;ve left Imperius in.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in this freight elevator. I\u0026rsquo;ve just sent out this message.\nAt this point, I think the elevator, like– there\u0026rsquo;s a grinding noise and it starts moving again really slowly, and it\u0026rsquo;s actually going a little bit back up. It\u0026rsquo;s going up to the nearest door, and they are going to, uh… no, wait! I\u0026rsquo;m… yeah, no, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to do that. I was like– okay, here\u0026rsquo;s my thought process. I was like, they can pull me back up. They can open the door. I can deal with, like– the challenge can be getting by them again. Then I was like, do I want to try and disable the tracker again and have that be a potential consequence for failure? If I do succeed at that, how do I get out of the freight elevator? I guess they would still know that I\u0026rsquo;m in it because they managed to track me there. So yeah, okay.\nWhile I\u0026rsquo;m sitting, like, trapped in this elevator, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try again… [Laughing] to disable this tracker.\nAnd I know there\u0026rsquo;s something a little gauche about rolling to do the same thing multiple times. I think the thing is… I\u0026rsquo;m counting as like, there are changed circumstances every time, in that, like, part of the reason I am consistently failing is because I\u0026rsquo;m on the run? Every single time I have tried to roll, it\u0026rsquo;s in part because, like, I can\u0026rsquo;t give it my full attention. I can\u0026rsquo;t take time. Which is still true here, but it\u0026rsquo;s like– I\u0026rsquo;m basically just saying like, this is why I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s fair to keep rolling for it, rather than just being like, you have to stop trying to do that. Um…\nBecause I mean, I can keep failing! And I have. And stuff will keep happening. But, like, it\u0026rsquo;s OK to keep trying. What a beautiful sentiment for life.\nUh, yeah. OK, OK, OK. So.\nMATT: There\u0026rsquo;s one little part of the rules left that I haven\u0026rsquo;t used, and that\u0026rsquo;s advantage and disadvantage. Basically, if you are in a better position, you\u0026rsquo;ve got the right equipment, all that kind of stuff, you have advantage on your wager, so you get one Fury back and you add one die.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also, I guess– part of that is if you win a challenge with advantage, then you \u0026ldquo;Kill to feed,\u0026rdquo; which also gives you one Fury, and I like this because it kind of plays into– it says, \u0026ldquo;Take note of the victim\u0026rsquo;s name.\u0026rdquo; I have established in my fiction that, like, drinking the blood kind of gives you some of their knowledge as well? So that, take note of the victim\u0026rsquo;s name, is like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know who this guy is. Until I eat him! And then I know everything that he knew, which is kind of weird and creepy and vampirey.\nSo anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m planning to bring all of that in. And I like the idea of giving Imperius, like, kind of the best chance possible to have this happen, so I\u0026rsquo;m thinking… and again, this is implied in my fiction already. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that vampires in this sort of setting have the, like, turn into mist, turn into bat kind of situation, but I think they do have sort of superior movement, because I described dropping into the Gardens. So how could just some guy have gotten into, like a– security of– the security of the Gardens to talk to the guy he knew without some sort of vampire powers? Although I\u0026rsquo;ve left them very vague.\nI think in this sort of Undercity context that I\u0026rsquo;ve been exploring, you know, recycling machines and, you know, pipes and air vents and stuff like that, I think Imperius has the advantage of movement. So what I\u0026rsquo;m imagining is that he\u0026rsquo;s waiting on some pipes in the ceiling or on the ceiling, against the ceiling, waiting for just one of these hunters to be in the right position.\nEven though this is, uh- should probably be Vigor because it\u0026rsquo;s probably going to be a physical fight, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll Insight. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll Insight because I\u0026rsquo;m waiting for just the right moment, so that gives me two dice to roll, plus I\u0026rsquo;m gonna- because the advantage of the movement and I\u0026rsquo;m on the ceiling and I\u0026rsquo;m unexpected, it\u0026rsquo;s a surprise attack, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna give myself the bonus die.\nBecause I\u0026rsquo;m attacking with advantage, I get one fury back, which I\u0026rsquo;m gonna spend to pick two numbers here.\nSo this is where this really feels dangerous, because I could still lose. I could still lose, even with this advantage, um, but I- I\u0026rsquo;m gonna- I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try for it.\nAlright. What do I want to pick for my wager? Um, the dice are on four and five right now, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna pick- I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna say four and five. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna pick them up… four and five. [Dice rolling, huge sigh] I got one four. I got one four. So I\u0026rsquo;ve succeeded in this thing, this attack.\nALYSSA: I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine that a regular cyberdoc would be thrilled to see me, and I wonder if this means I have to go to a specific vampire doctor. Obviously, people in the family get into scrapes; I assume we have some doctors in the know on retainer. I mean, someone has to help with the fangs and everything else.\nBut this was an off-book mission, and if I report to a Calamity doctor, then the Calamity will know that I was hurt, and I have no reason to be hurt right now, so that would only cause problems, so I think that what I am going to do is rely on one of the other clans.\nSATAH: I am going to spend another Fury. I\u0026rsquo;m down to three out of five. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do just my straight 3d6. Am I? Or should I be at disadvantage at this point? Because… I\u0026rsquo;ve been rolling at disadvantage to disable the tracker. Yes. Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do that.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m rolling 2d6. I\u0026rsquo;m spending a Fury. I would like to roll a three or a five. [Giggling, dice rolling] Oh my god, I did it! I did it! I did it; I rolled a three and a two. Holy shit! [Laughing] Okay. Okay! I disabled the tracker!\nMATT: So I imagine Imperius drops down behind, let\u0026rsquo;s say, the last guy, the last hunter in this pack. Drops down behind him, grabs him, does the vampire thing, feeds to kill as the advantage. I\u0026rsquo;ve overcome this challenge with advantage, which means I feed to kill. So I get back the one Fury that I had spent on this attempt. I\u0026rsquo;ll mark that, which gives me– I\u0026rsquo;m back up to four of five fury.\nAnd alright, I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll this into a combat now, which I think is… because I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep going with this sort of, like, giving myself the best chance to succeed, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do a combat, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s, again, going to be an insight-based combat, because I think mainly what he wants to do is he wants to start insulting these other hunters with, like, secrets that he just learned from the guy he ate. Like, hey, Brian, did you know that, like, your wife was cheating on you with Chad here? Like, did you know that? For, like, six years? Wow. And other things like that, that Imperius is going to be kind of shouting in the dark of this Undercity area, just really trying to throw these people off their game.\nSo again, two dice for insight. I\u0026rsquo;m going to carry that surprise advantage and this sort of, like, targeted– it\u0026rsquo;s advantage because I have the secret information from… did I say Chad? Did I eat Chad, and then I\u0026rsquo;ve got his secrets? So I\u0026rsquo;m using that against them. I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend a Fury to pick two numbers, so back down to three Fury.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m going to go two and five this time. [Dice rolling] I got two fives. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t give me more success, but it is success.\nALYSSA: \u0026ldquo;Clan SSinor: Founded by a scientist, this clan is heavily involved in biocybernetic development and dominates the underground market for synthetic and organic organs.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I need organs, but I certainly need blood and patching up. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s probably someone in this clan that I could call on.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;ve overcome again on advantage, so I kill to feed again. I do have to roll for damage. [Die rolling] That also gave me a five. So again, I have come out of that combat basically clean.\nALYSSA: The question is how easy it is to do.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and otherwise self-paced TTRPGs.

I\u0026rsquo;m your host, Satah, and I\u0026rsquo;m showcasing multiple possible experiences of self-paced games by inviting guests to play them alongside me so I can compile our stories together. Now and for the rest of June, you can head over to critawards.org to vote for Folio to win \u0026ldquo;Best upcoming podcast\u0026rdquo; or for me to win \u0026ldquo;Best tech/producer.\u0026rdquo; I put a lot of love and labour into editing this show and it would be really cool to have that recognised with a win.\nThis is episode three of our games of Furyya, a solo journalling game in \u0026ldquo;a dystopian future where creatures of the night adapt to technology to survive\u0026rdquo; by Uoshi, who\u0026rsquo;s also the layout artist for the currently-crowdfunding print editions of Galactic \u0026amp; Going Rogue. Backing it gets you two cool games and supports the work of bunch of cool creators in the TTRPG space, including me.\nThe other two beautiful undead trawling the neon streets with me are Matt Orr and Alyssa. This is, by far, the least structured game featured on the show so far, and I\u0026rsquo;m so delighted by our three different approaches to it. Matt treats encounters like he\u0026rsquo;s building the prompt for a journal entry that then, like, fully develop the ideas as he writes it. He\u0026rsquo;s probably the most rational in his hesitant approach to rolling dice, given how intentionally failure-heavy the system is. Meanwhile, Alyssa uses most of their rolls to determine big picture stuff \u0026amp; then takes a lot of authorship filling in the details to fully draw out this, like, fantastic story of grief and rage that they\u0026rsquo;re building. Personally, I love to be in trouble, so I\u0026rsquo;m rolling for everything, \u0026amp; I\u0026rsquo;ve simply never had a thought that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be improved by interfacing with a table. [Laughs]\nThat lack of structure in the game also meant that this series has been more of a puzzle to put together than some of the more heavily structured games, but it\u0026rsquo;s also been so satisfying, and I hope you\u0026rsquo;re enjoying it, and if you are… [Sputters for a moment] maybe vote for me and the show in the CRiT awards about it! I dunno! Whatever!\nAlright, and we can… let\u0026rsquo;s rejoin our… hm. Heroes? By jacking the fuck in:\nGAME SATAH: I disabled the tracker, but they still know where I was last, and it was trapped in a freight elevator. [Laughing] So.\nI wonder if part of the reason that I was able to do it is because I logged back onto CalamityNet for a sec and basically, like, was able to use– like, it was a risk, but kind of used the antivirus, anti-malware to help me disable this tracker. Whatever, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nreally matter. I managed to do it! Finally!\nAnd, uh… that said! I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in this freight elevator… and it does start moving up.\nMATT: I think I\u0026rsquo;ve neutralised the vampire threat– the vampire hunters. Like, I\u0026rsquo;ve killed two of them here in the dark… or, you know, in the machine rooms down under the city. I think the others flee. I think I\u0026rsquo;m also going to add to the scene, because there\u0026rsquo;s no real way to generate money in this game, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to search these guys and I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to find out… I\u0026rsquo;m going to get some more credits or equipment or something. [Dice rolling] I think that\u0026rsquo;ll be interesting. This is not in the rules. I\u0026rsquo;m making this part up. Uh, so that\u0026rsquo;s a total of 15 credits. Rolled 2d6 twice. I got a nice little chunk of change. And we\u0026rsquo;ll say that it\u0026rsquo;s… some of its equipment that I could pawn or trade, and some of it\u0026rsquo;s their actual– maybe they had credits on them. Although how do cyber credits work? How do you loot the body for cyber credits in the- in the far future? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to worry about it too much.\nSATAH: They\u0026rsquo;re pulling it back up and they are opening the doors. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and do the same maneuver that I pulled before where I try to just sneak past them using that camouflage. I am going to roll at a disadvantage, because, like, they know that I can do that because I did it before.\nSo… Vigor is one, plus Adaptskin Camouflage is three, plus disadvantage is two. 2d6. Do I want to spend a Fury on this? I\u0026rsquo;m getting low… that\u0026rsquo;s okay. It\u0026rsquo;s one shot. Ride it like you stole it. Down to two out of five.\nI would like to roll a three or a five on my 2d6. [Dice rolling] Holy shit, I rolled two fives! Hot damn!\nI think one of the reasons this works is that, like, uh– there\u0026rsquo;s still some discord between the private security and the, like, actual corporate Hoshi agents. Things are just… a little bit hectic enough– ooh, especially because TRAINR was like, \u0026ldquo;Somebody fucking stole from my store!\u0026rdquo; and so the private security are like, \u0026ldquo;Yes, technically you would be able to pull rank on us…\u0026rdquo; like Hoshi called in a security thing that was probably like a need-to-know basis. Like, capture this person; you don\u0026rsquo;t get to know what they did. Which, for that one, the Hoshi agents would be able to be like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, stand down, you\u0026rsquo;re private security\u0026rsquo; we\u0026rsquo;re pulling rank here.\u0026rdquo;\nBut because I stole from TRAINR and TRAINR knows that, the private security is like, \u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;re coincidentally also looking for this person!! And so, no, this is our jurisdiction.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think they\u0026rsquo;re probably, like, tracking the, like, camouflage signature or whatever. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. But like, yeah, they are– they are. The girls are fighting. And, um, I\u0026rsquo;m saying retroactively, like, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make this work because they are distracted by fighting with each other. And that\u0026rsquo;s great.\nALYSSA: So I think that what happens is that I go home, I get cleaned up, and I go to the club.\nSATAH: I get off the freight elevator. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do the same thing that I did before, which is roll a location to see kind of like where in the Towers I get off. [Die roll]\nALYSSA \u0026amp; SATAH: One…\nALYSSA: … of the locations in the Book of Fate is\nALYSSA\u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Drip Nightclub,\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;a place shared by vampires and humans. It belongs to the Calamity Clan.\u0026rdquo; Coooool. Okay.\nALYSSA: It belongs to the Calamity Clan, but I assume that it acts as a sort of neutral ground that other vampires are allowed there as well, and so I think I go to the club hoping to be able to pick up someone from Clan Ssinor and get a little bit of help, uh, with my bloody bullet-y holy water? issue.\nSATAH: So this isn\u0026rsquo;t actually Drip Nightclub, because that is a separate place, but this is definitely a club.\nAnd is it Calamity-friendly? I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll on that NPC list. One or one or two is Calamity, three is unaffiliated, four to six is rival. Is that the- is that the weight that I want for this? … Yeah. And I\u0026rsquo;ll figure out– I\u0026rsquo;ll roll for the clan after and just see what my– if I roll a rival clan, I\u0026rsquo;ll figure out who it is and what my relationship is to them.\n[Die rolling] Unaffiliated! Okay! That is so– that is, like, such a weirdly fascinating result. Okay.\nMATT: I don\u0026rsquo;t get much information about, like, who sent them or anything like that.\nOr do I?\nNo, I already rolled for the credits, so I\u0026rsquo;ve made three rolls, three sets of rolls for this little thing. I think I\u0026rsquo;m- I know it\u0026rsquo;s going to happen tomorrow as well, but I\u0026rsquo;ve got to write up this log. I think it\u0026rsquo;ll be something Imperius is recounting the story while he picks over the remains of these- these hunters that he\u0026rsquo;s bested.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on two tables to just see a little bit more about what this place is. This is a club that is, remember, in essentially a mall, a very tall mall. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on an NPC list that has, um, sort of temperaments? \u0026ldquo;Peaceful,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;diplomatic,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;reactive,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;violent,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;dangerous.\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on the threats table, not to actually find a threat, but to sort of just further characterise who it is that owns this club.\nSo first, the temperament. [Die rolling] One, peaceful. Okay! The threat. [Die rolling] Corporate military agent. So a club owned by peaceful corporate military agent.\nMy first thought was it\u0026rsquo;s like a new corporation in town. They\u0026rsquo;re like keeping the peace to try and, like, slowly stake out territory. The other thing is it could be a very specifically neutral club… slash maybe restaurant. [Laughs] It\u0026rsquo;s a place where– like, this is a big- a place of, like– there\u0026rsquo;s retail and commerce. There are a lot of different corporate interests here.\nI think that what this is is like truly neutral territory. It is meant for, like- this is where people can come on their break. Corpos can. And yeah, they just– it is- it is owned by… like, a coalition of different corporations I think- what it is- is what it is, very carefully balanced to maintain equal powers. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s literally just on this one floor of the mall, right? Like, everywhere else is insane but this- this particular one is very carefully as neutral as possible.\nAnd I think one of the things that is great for me about that is that, uh, there will initially be a reaction to like the fact that these Hoshi agents and the private security agents are, like, doing business on this floor at all, is going to be like pretty uncouth and so that\u0026rsquo;s an advantage for me. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s also, like, a disadvantage in that my clan, my family, Calamity, isn\u0026rsquo;t specifically corporate. We have a lot of power in the corporate structures because we have a lot of money, but we are, in the end, outside of that system, and so there\u0026rsquo;s distrust there. People aren\u0026rsquo;t going to like that Hoshi and the private agents are, like, fighting and doing business and bickering with each other, but ultimately, like, they might like me less if they find me, so.\nThe other thing here is that because this space is kept neutral through, like, strict regulation and monitoring, I bet that they have something that can sense my camouflage thing. So the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m going to do here is, uh… I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll to try and get through the club unseen.\nWhat is this club called? Not Drip. Splash. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it Splash. And I think truly it\u0026rsquo;s like a horrendous amalgam of like– it is a club, but it\u0026rsquo;s also just a restaurant where you can get lunch, and like– it\u0026rsquo;s not, like, during the day it\u0026rsquo;s a restaurant and at the night it\u0026rsquo;s a club, it\u0026rsquo;s just- it\u0026rsquo;s both. And it kind of sucks. It kind of sucks, but it\u0026rsquo;s also kind of great. And like, it\u0026rsquo;s big enough that you can get far enough away that the music isn\u0026rsquo;t overwhelming. You can still hear it if you\u0026rsquo;re just trying to, like, eat your sandwich, but it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty terrible place and that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Log 007. The Praug file, continued.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I fed from the source. [Deep inhale] This isn\u0026rsquo;t synthetic B. No. No, that was the good stuff. Better than a cold one with the lads. [Laughing] That\u0026rsquo;s Chad. He\u0026rsquo;s fresh in my mind.\nThey were good. But these tunnels and shafts let me get the drop on them. And so to say, I got all the Chad there was.\nThe rest… Brian, Wilson, Beth, and Jamie, they took some shots at me, but then I told Brian his wife was cheating with Chad for three whole years! I have no reason to keep a dead man\u0026rsquo;s secrets!\nThat made Brian\u0026rsquo;s aim much worse.\nI tossed the Chad husk at them, and they ran. All of them. I caught up to Jamie, though. She was a fine O flavor. I\u0026rsquo;ve never tasted it before. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know any more than Chad did.\nSeems Wilson is the head of the outfit. He got the job– they all called it \u0026ldquo;a job.\u0026rdquo; Right now, I don\u0026rsquo;t care! I know where they all live. I know their favorite kvass orders. I know the feel of the sheets on Brian\u0026rsquo;s bed. [Chuckles] I can follow up later, if I want to.\nI checked their pockets. No IDs. Hobbyists, but doing it right. Some credits, their guns, some other implants. I can sell it all soon enough.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve left the husks in gentle repose. Maintenance will find them eventually. Now, to see about getting out of here.\nEnd log.\nALYSSA: The game plan, I think, is to go in looking as normal as possible, which– I can mask. That part is fine. I\u0026rsquo;m used to pain. But I have to identify someone, ideally a doctor from this other clan, and then I have to convince them to help me without notifying my clan under their noses at a club that is owned by and presumably operated by them!\nI am going to roll myself an Insight for just identifying someone who can help me, and then, unfortunately, I think that it is Trauma in order to talk them into it. So we\u0026rsquo;ll make that first roll. Insight is two, and the number I will call is a four. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve had a four yet.\n[Dice rolling] And I continue to not have a four. That is a one and a two. So! Let\u0026rsquo;s see how bad this failure is. [Die rolling] Oof, oof, oof. That is a one on the failure die. On a one, you have a critical failure and face harsh punishment.\nMATT: Coming into today for log eight, I think I\u0026rsquo;m feeling we\u0026rsquo;re about we\u0026rsquo;re more than halfway through the story for sure. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure of that. Um, I\u0026rsquo;ve interacted with almost every single rule in the game– and– at least once, and, um it\u0026rsquo;s, like eight characters, so– I\u0026rsquo;ve introduced, like, eight, you know, other vampires as characters. So I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to start narrowing down the story and moving sort of– to beginning to move to some sort of conclusion. So, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to not introduce any more characters.\nHowever, having said that, there\u0026rsquo;s three sort of next plot lines that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about. I\u0026rsquo;ve introduced the concept of child and sire, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t– we don\u0026rsquo;t know who Imperius\u0026rsquo;s sire is., so maybe there\u0026rsquo;s, like, an even more important vampire that we could, like, go talk to.\nAlso, I\u0026rsquo;ve– I\u0026rsquo;m in the Undercity again, so I think the people that I talked to in the very beginning of the story, I think maybe they come find me. You know, they said they could smell a rat, and maybe they sniff me out. That is– who is that? That is Embracing, Embracing Torino.\nAnd then the third plot line is maybe, since I\u0026rsquo;ve been asking questions, possibly Charitable Praug comes to me in the first place and finds… like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, look, I know you\u0026rsquo;ve been asking around, but like, here\u0026rsquo;s the real mystery.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd maybe all three of those things happen, but they happen in a very specific order that I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about yet.\nSo what to do first?\nALYSSA: I think it\u0026rsquo;s pretty clear how this goes.\nI clean myself up. I go to the club. I am feeling great about my ability to mask, my ability to look casual and not like I\u0026rsquo;m bleeding out and feel acid starting to course through my veins, radiating from my shoulder, through my stolen blood, through the rest of my body.\nUh, but I am a little delulu! So, actually, I do not look as hot as I think that I do.\nAnd someone from Clan Calamity clocks me. I mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s hard to, like I said. The clan is small, and we know each other, and they know that I\u0026rsquo;m not one for nightclubs normally, never mind after the loss of Ayla. So I\u0026rsquo;m easily noticed, and the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m in pain is easily noticed.\nAnd with that comes questions.\nAnd with the questions comes a punishment.\nBartender or security or whoever it is that notices me takes me to a back room. And I could try to fight it. I could try to leave and run right now, but that would be completely cutting myself off from my clan and it\u0026rsquo;s still a point of contact with her. While I\u0026rsquo;m going against their wishes, it\u0026rsquo;s more of an \u0026ldquo;easier to ask forgiveness than permission\u0026rdquo; type situation. It\u0026rsquo;s not a \u0026ldquo;I want to cut myself off from them\u0026rdquo; type of deal.\nSo I let myself be taken, and I let myself be questioned. It is not a big elder in the clan, but one of the older vampires– older than me, and I\u0026rsquo;m like a hundred– who comes into the room, and I think that they were a friend. This is almost mercy at first, sending this person to me. We will give them a name… and you know, this was a friend of Ayla. This is someone who is also big into the tech and hacking, and they only go by their sort of net running handle. So this is Silver Oracle, we will say. Any pronouns for them.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;m still in the Undercity, so I think I have to meet Embracing and her crew first. So what is that going to look like? Do I do another wager in this situation or do I just kind of narratively advance things? Um, and then how does that work with my, like, make three skill rolls before I write the log?\nLet me get out the Book of Fate and see what comes to me.\nALYSSA: Oracle comes in and just stares. And then reaches out and pokes right into the bullet wound.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m made to be stoic. That\u0026rsquo;s my job. My job is to take punishment, to take pain, but, um– it\u0026rsquo;s a lot right now! Sort of adrenaline has worn off. Blood loss has started to set in. And so I scream. And I am unsoothed by this whole interaction.\nAnd she just stares me down, waiting for me to talk. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take long. I mean, this is a person that I know. It\u0026rsquo;s a person who I know loved Ayla– clearly not as much as me, because they\u0026rsquo;re here at the club instead of out trying to kill vampire hunters, but they loved her enough that they should understand, right?\nBut they don\u0026rsquo;t. Instead, Oracle… he looks disappointed that I would do this, that I would put my own personal feelings– and he tells me, after listening to me spill my guts about where I was and what I was doing and why, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t he understand, and I think I show him the teeth that I pulled from the mouth of Brahm. And he just looks disappointed and a little disgusted with me. Not at the violence, but at my short-sightedness and my lack of honour attacking a man in his home, even if that man was a vampire hunter, and doing it all behind the back of the family.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the big thing, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? We are a family and we should be working together and I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be bringing shame to them by using underhanded tactics to kill someone for vengeance in a quest that the family itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t agree with.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been told time and time again since Ayla\u0026rsquo;s death that the Calamity will have its revenge, but it won\u0026rsquo;t be through simple murder. It\u0026rsquo;s going to take longer, and it\u0026rsquo;s going to be structural. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be finding out who hired the vampire hunter, and why, and why they were looking for information on the Calamity itself. And after getting every single drop they can– out of the vampire hunter, out of who hired them, so on and so forth, spreading their web, using Ayla\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice, if they can, in order to promote the family– then we would have vengeance.\nBut that takes so long and seems so far out, and I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait. And so I acted, and now I\u0026rsquo;ve acted directly against the orders of my clan, and that merits punishment.\nAnd I think that what that means is that they will fix me up. Fix the bullet, nullify whatever poison it is that Brahm used against me, but after that, I don\u0026rsquo;t have the freedom that I did, because I clearly can\u0026rsquo;t be trusted to wield it.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;m looking at the location table again and I\u0026rsquo;ve– I said that I probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t under the Gardens. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out where I am under and I\u0026rsquo;ll find that out from meeting some Undercity folk. [Die rolling] That came up as Desperados again… do I go with what the die says or do I change it? No, I think I\u0026rsquo;m okay. I don\u0026rsquo;t love that because that\u0026rsquo;s a part of the city I\u0026rsquo;ve already been to, so– but- but I think it\u0026rsquo;s okay. It makes sense that I come back there. You know, the recycling center exits into the stony wasteland or the rubble-strewn wasteland outside the city. It makes sense.\nALYSSA: I started as a shield… as a weapon to be wielded by the Calamity, and I\u0026rsquo;ve proven that I\u0026rsquo;m not worthy right now of having my own autonomy, and so until they can find someone who is able to help direct me, I am grounded. I am to stay in the clan compound with no weapons and no tech, and wait until my head cools and they\u0026rsquo;re able to make use of me again.\nMATT: I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the NPC table again to generate who– I\u0026rsquo;m not going to meet Embracing directly. [Chuckles] Here I am again introducing new characters. But this is just going to be a messenger!\n[Die rolling several times] Elderly messenger who is also violent. I think that fits.\nOne more thing that I want to know about or do… well, I think then I will. I will make the wager because then that really determines whether or not, uh, things go well or go poorly\nI mean, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter because it\u0026rsquo;s two dice, but I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll Trauma on this one as a psychological interaction. So it\u0026rsquo;s 2d6. I gotta make a wager. I\u0026rsquo;ve just rolled a bunch of fives so it\u0026rsquo;s tempting to roll- to claim five… I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do two. [Dice rolling] Both twos. Amazing. So I succeed at this wager, which means that I get what I want out of this.\nSo I finally get some answers from, I think, Embracing and her colony? Coven? I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to call them. I\u0026rsquo;m going to figure that out, what they call themselves, perhaps.\nUm, but I think maybe I\u0026rsquo;m one step closer, as Imperius, to finding Charitable.\nALYSSA: And I think that\u0026rsquo;s as good a place as any for the second log.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll just like I did last time, pretty much. Uh, Vigor plus my Adaptskin is three, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to be at disadvantage because I really do think that they would have things to censor– to sense camouflage. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do 2d6.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to spend a Fury because I\u0026rsquo;m getting real close to none, which would mean I\u0026rsquo;d… fail quite badly.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll 2d6. I\u0026rsquo;d like to roll… a six! This is- this club is an amalgam of many different corporate interests, and therefore they would go for the safest possible success and failure. Don\u0026rsquo;t you think? So I\u0026rsquo;d like to roll a six on these two d6.\nUgh… rolled a two and a five. [Laughing]\nLet\u0026rsquo;s roll for failure. [Die rolling] Three. Failure, punishing consequence. Yeah… yeah, yeah, yeah.\nALYSSA: When I say that I\u0026rsquo;ve been restricted from technology, I mean it, and I\u0026rsquo;m certainly not going to chance a message to this secret dropbox that I have.\nSATAH: I mean, obviously, they managed to sense the camouflage, right? They have tools for that. And I think the thing that makes this consequence punishing, rather than just like… like, a better failure here would be that, um, the club security, the true neutral security grabs me. The thing that makes this punishing is that it\u0026rsquo;s one of the Hoshi agents.\nI managed to sneak by. I\u0026rsquo;m making my way through the club and there\u0026rsquo;s an agent just, like, at the door of the club. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so– [Laughing] I actually do make it through the club, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go out the front door. The front door has a thing that turns off my camouflage automatically. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re going in or out, it just shorts it.\nAnd there are Hoshi agents in the hall. Just back up, you know. And so not only is it one of the Hoshi agents that gets me, I\u0026rsquo;m outside of the club. It actually would have been better for me to get caught in the club because there are different rules there. But I\u0026rsquo;m not. I stepped out.\nALYSSA: Unlike the other logs, log two is simply an audio recording picked up from the apartment where I\u0026rsquo;m under house arrest. And it\u0026rsquo;s just security footage.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Log 008. The Praug file.\nALYSSA, AS TISIPHONY: Log 002.\nGrounded like a petulant child. Just because what? Because I acted when they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t? Because I loved more than they were willing to?\nI failed you… I failed you, and I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry… I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\nMATT: I am currently in a private vehicle, so forgive any noise or interruptions. Not a nice vehicle, but functional.\nAfter my last log, I was wandering upwards towards street level. I was really feeling fine! Solemn Torino and three other women met me on about level twenty-two. Old. Really, a group of quite distinguished dames.\nBy then, I had worked out that I was on the edge of Desperados again. That makes sense… they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t put all the recycling works under the nice part of Belona.\nSol slapped me. She said she was from Torino\u0026rsquo;s collective. They all were, but the slap was from Embracing herself.\nThey seem to think I\u0026rsquo;ve been out here making a mess of things! What things, I asked?\nThey just led me to a converted tram. I was still feeling all topped off and maybe could have taken them… she\u0026rsquo;s shaking her head at me. Well, I didn\u0026rsquo;t try.\nWe took the tram to… somewhere. Back toward the city. It was tight for all four of us. I think it used to be a package delivery system?\nI got to speak to Miss Torino again. Uh, Embracing Torino, and this wasn\u0026rsquo;t in her residence. This was more like a factory. They were all making reports. Miss Torino– Solem Torino– called it a newsroom. Someone has to make the vids, but I never gave it any thought. That\u0026rsquo;s daytime stuff.\nEmbracing Torino was unquestioned here, including by me. She asked how I was faring, and I had to admit, uh, not well. She told me she knew all about what I\u0026rsquo;d been up to for the last three days. The fight with Miss Canossus, the visit to Virt… er, Mx Abydos. I tried to be very clear that I thought something was going on, but I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen the whole shape of it yet.\nThe collective was all grave looks and probably silent messages. Now she\u0026rsquo;s nodding… I don\u0026rsquo;t think Calamity needs a king. Hear that? It\u0026rsquo;s in my log now! I don\u0026rsquo;t think Calamity needs a king.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing or a bad thing, but… I seem to have passed some kind of test.\nWe finally came up on the streets just after sunset. Noticeable pain from the rosy glow just after sunset. I\u0026rsquo;m getting a signal to wrap this up. Uh– they are taking me to see Miss Praug. End log.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on the armament table to see what this person is packing, to see what kind of danger I\u0026rsquo;m in. [Die rolling] Two, \u0026ldquo;melee weapon. Knives, daggers, swords, nightsticks, simple or with poisoning, thermal shock, and other effects,\u0026rdquo; yeah.\nALYSSA: Time passes… and the Calamity is many things, but one thing it\u0026rsquo;s not is inefficient with its resources.\nAnd so, eventually, a threat comes that\u0026rsquo;s big enough for them to let me out.\nAnd I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and roll on the table for what that threat actually is. Ha!! Okay! That is a five, which means that it is a vampire hunter.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t named this big bad vampire hunter yet… ooh, okay. The vampire hunter is Ferrous Reed. Ferris spelled like iron, F-E-R-R-O-U-S. I would say he/they pronouns.\nSo. The threat that comes for the Calamity is the vampire hunter. Is Ferrous Reed. The person who killed my Ayla. And did it because they were looking for something, because as far as we can tell, they wanted some sort of information about the Calamity, and we still don\u0026rsquo;t know who hired them.\nBut what we do know now, as I learn from Silver Oracle, as she lets me out of house arrest, hands over some weapons and a communication device and whatever else I need for the upcoming mission. What we do know about Ferrous Reed is that he has struck again against us. And this time, the person that he has struck was not quite as loyal.\nAnd the way that this has been found out by the family Calamity is that one of our safe houses was hit, and one of the vampires who had been staying there was taken, and in their place were the fangs and the tongue of one of the other Calamity. Because this one was willing to talk, but words aren\u0026rsquo;t enough to save you from the reckoning that is Ferrous and whoever it is that they\u0026rsquo;re working for.\nAnd this clear threat and the failure over the past weeks, months, however much time it\u0026rsquo;s been since I was grounded, that\u0026rsquo;s enough to spurn the Calamity into action, even without solid intel.\nAnd so I am freed, and I am brought into the planning.\nSATAH: They like, uh… they see me. We- we- I stop, they stop. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised that we\u0026rsquo;re making eye contact. And they, um, just lunge forward and they press, like… just a device to my body, and I feel this electric hum, and I– they don\u0026rsquo;t even need to make the threat out loud. I already know that something is pressed to my body that, like, if they hit a button or whatever, it will just fry all of the cyberware in my body. Which is, like, I mean, there\u0026rsquo;s the fangs, but also I\u0026rsquo;m a hacker. I got stuff in my brain and whatever, you know? Like, it might not kill me, but it might. And it will certainly, like, take me out. So… I just slowly put my hands up. And, uh… hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;m sitting down to play day nine. I immediately have a thought about how I want this interaction to go, or at least what meeting with Charitable Praug will be like for Imperius. And I just have to think of… I just have to check the book and see some things that I might want to roll to test this.\nI think… so it\u0026rsquo;s- so it\u0026rsquo;s a– I kind of want to like… keep it secret for their narration, because this is a- this is a podcast, but, um, I have to talk through the game! So, like I think it- I think it requires going into the- the network again. So I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll on Trauma again. That\u0026rsquo;s the, uh, hacking capability attribute here.\nSo, um, basically what I\u0026rsquo;m doing is- I think that\u0026rsquo;s where she\u0026rsquo;s been hiding, so I have to- I have to match. I have to keep secret, right? Like, my interactions, that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m testing. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m wagering, right? I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend a Fury because I want to give myself an advantage here, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with… two and six.\nRolling 2d6. I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a two or a six. [Dice rolling] I didn\u0026rsquo;t get that. At all.\nALYSSA: Because I am a blunt instrument and I do need to be reminded of my place, the place in the plan I have is as bait.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know the consequences of killing Brahm, but the Calamity certainly do. And it\u0026rsquo;s not that it\u0026rsquo;s being kept from me, but knowing isn\u0026rsquo;t important right now. What matters is that I\u0026rsquo;m being punished for it.\nAnd so, hoping that Ferrous is moved by revenge, even a fraction as much as I am, the Calamity decides that I will get to play bait and try to lure him out so that another team– of vampires, of hired muscle… of members of an enemy clan, even.\nI think that someone in the Calamity has ties to a member of what has to be the Carcaz, and there are a few of them, as well, in the room while we\u0026rsquo;re listening to the plan, as it were.\nI play bait and I lure out the vampire hunter and then they all attack.\nAnd I mean, presumably I\u0026rsquo;m not attacking because in this scenario, I\u0026rsquo;m dead. In their best laid plans. But that isn\u0026rsquo;t what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen.\nMATT: How bad will the failure be? [Die rolling] Five. I\u0026rsquo;ve never rolled a five before. \u0026ldquo;Tolerable failure. No consequences.\u0026rdquo;\nThe crew here, the collective, the Torino collective that I\u0026rsquo;m with, will be backing me up. I think this is some high-level, nested, shell game, hiding in the network stuff. And I\u0026rsquo;ve got an assist here. So even though I make a mistake, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be no consequences.\nOkay, I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on events and kind of be inspired. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what I get. [Die rolling] Six. See, this is very appropriate, I feel, because what I\u0026rsquo;ve rolled was \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re about to commit a betrayal,\u0026rdquo; which makes a lot of sense.\nBecause I think the way this is set up, I\u0026rsquo;ve got factions, right? So, like, I\u0026rsquo;m about to switch– I think Imperius is about to switch factions. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of been where this is leading, although he doesn\u0026rsquo;t really know what\u0026rsquo;s happening, so I think I need to find one more thing to kind of help explain what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\nALYSSA: We figure out where to lay out this trap, and I will roll on the locations.\n[Die rolling] And it is back to the start. That is a six, again, for the Gardens. And so…\nI\u0026rsquo;ve never been poetic. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t even Ayla\u0026rsquo;s domain; it was just not a part of our relationship. But there\u0026rsquo;s something about the thought of luring this man out into the place where Brahm died, the place where he, Ferrous, failed to protect his apprentice, and the place that\u0026rsquo;s caused me so much pain, too, in the aftermath.\nAnd I suggest that to the Calamity, to the gathered people plotting to catch this vampire hunter. And surprisingly, they agree.\nI think part of the damage control for my attack was a bit of, you know, advantage-free– a small donation, let\u0026rsquo;s say, to the building management of that apartment complex that I broke into. But in addition to the free money, they also bought up at least one unit in the building, and so I have full access this time to get where I need to get, though I\u0026rsquo;m warned, of course, that security is going to be a little tighter. You don\u0026rsquo;t murder someone in a luxury residence and have no impact, especially when the residents can see the broken window, can see the ways in which their building management failed them, and they have the capital and the pull to make a stink about it.\nMATT: Looking at the cyberwares table… I got some more money when I was in the Undercity, so I could actually afford some of these other things now. The cheapest thing… or the most expensive thing I can afford with my 20 credits is something that costs 20 credits. A venom bug espionage droid. 360 camera, night vision, omnidirectional microphone.\nI could get that, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know what- I need that… but maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the ask, right? That I have to go back to the Praetor with the espionage droid. Get some details.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t love this as a plot point necessarily, but I think it makes a lot of sense based on what I\u0026rsquo;ve set up so far and what I\u0026rsquo;ve read or what I\u0026rsquo;ve rolled. So alright, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna write something up and we\u0026rsquo;ll see how this all- all these details come together.\nOUTRO SATAH: This has been Folio, an actual play podcast about solo and otherwise self-paced TTRPGs.

I am back off to the Gardens.\nSATAH: Speck, like, puts her hands up and she goes like, \u0026ldquo;Hey… what seems to be the problem? You know, I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually take any money out of that account…\u0026rdquo;\nMATT: Log 009. The Charitable Praug file.\nSATAH: And the Hoshi agent is like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, come on. Don\u0026rsquo;t play– don\u0026rsquo;t play with me like that.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Speck is like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not playing. Isn\u0026rsquo;t this because of–\u0026rdquo; uh, what was her name?\nALYSSA: Um, the plan this time is actually just going through the front door. And I think that because I have support from the rest of the Calamity, I am going to be able to roll my sort of first set-up of this plan with advantage. That means that I get a Fury back, which is amazing, and it also means that I can add one die to the attribute tested until the end of the challenge.\nAnd I think the attribute here is going to be Trauma, unfortunately, because it\u0026rsquo;s both acting confident and non-suspicious and hiding my face well enough that I\u0026rsquo;m not recognised going into the building, and then it\u0026rsquo;s also hacking into the unit itself. We want to notify Ferrous, but we don\u0026rsquo;t want to notify building security. We don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone else to know what\u0026rsquo;s going on until the deed is done. And unfortunately, as the first person- as the bait for this little plan, I have to be the one getting us into the apartment, and so I have to be the one attempting to hack the door and the building security once again.\nUm, I do get plus one die, so I\u0026rsquo;m actually rolling one instead of rolling at disadvantage, but let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes. I will call a one. [Die rolling] That is a one on the die! Let\u0026rsquo;s go!!\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;This is all just because I went into Nocturne\u0026rsquo;s bank account, right? Thing is, I really wanted to pay for this…\u0026rdquo; Gestures to the, like, shorting camouflage.\nAnd this agent is like, \u0026ldquo;Come on. You know what you did.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think one of the things that is going to happen here is Speck is going to go like, \u0026ldquo;Do you know what I did? Or have they not told you?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think this is going to be a challenge, and not one that Speck is super good at. [Laughs] Um… oh, wait! \u0026ldquo;Psychological capabilities.\u0026rdquo; I was thinking this might be Insight because it\u0026rsquo;s, like, wisdom, but I think actually, yeah, this is, like- this is Speck trying to get under this person\u0026rsquo;s skin, and so I think I actually am rolling with T. Psychological and hacking capabilities. I love that. Absolutely. Okay, cool. Yeah.\nSo, like, the challenge here– Speck has said, like- is making a bet essentially that like this person is not important enough to actually know what\u0026rsquo;s going on and that will hurt their feelings.\nAm I gonna give myself advantage for this because they were in the hallway, which makes it more likely..? No. But I\u0026rsquo;m- I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna- I\u0026rsquo;m gonna. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll 3d6.\nI would like to roll… [Exhales] oh my goodness. I got stressed out and put my dice down. I would like to roll a five. No. Yes. Yes. [Dice rolling] Fuck me. I nearly switched it to a three, which would have been nice because I rolled a one three and a six, which is a failure.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see. How bad is this failure? [Die rolling] Six. Tolerable failure, no consequence. Great!\nYeah, then I think what that means is just that, like, this agent just rolls their eyes because yes, they do know exactly what I did. And they think it\u0026rsquo;s stupid that, like, I tried that tack, but they\u0026rsquo;re like, whatever. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to them.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: On my way back to the hall. This is not how I thought it would go. I had no idea.\nI guess I can at least say I found Charitable.\nEmbracing\u0026rsquo;s collective took me to a private residence above a vid parlour. Two of them went with me, Sol and Hush.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a cover. No one lives in the apartment, but she was there. In a stasis suite like I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen before.\nHer limbs, the nerves, they were all spliced out right into the interfaces. It\u0026rsquo;s all fluorescent glow and low hums.\nShe\u0026rsquo;s alive on this side, but she really lives on the other side now.\nSol gave me a jack. She insisted. My signal is known and could be traced. I plugged in and had some trouble with the protocols– it\u0026rsquo;s very archaic code.\nThen I was in Charitable\u0026rsquo;s world. Twilight light in a half-buried house, in a field of green grass, studded with yellow flowers. My eyeline was through the long, low windows across that field. It looked endless. Maybe it was endless.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure we were on the network. A private network? Of course it\u0026rsquo;s possible, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. You can\u0026rsquo;t go anywhere. Why strand yourself on an island?\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t really get to that question. She was there– Charitable. Looking like an older, wiser version of herself than any of the profiles I\u0026rsquo;ve been working from, with a low voice, and strong.\nShe called me by name. I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt named like that since before I was turned. How much of it was how she presents herself now and how much of it was how she wanted me to see her? I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nWe talked. We talked about the news from the hall, about my work, before, as a researcher. She told me about her life with Daring. The sun never got any lower. Night never came. It was endless orange light and warm shadows lancing across every surface.\nThen we came to it. Power struggles. Big plans. Next year\u0026rsquo;s Consuls. The future of the clan. She asked me about working under Daring. Do I think he\u0026rsquo;ll become less ruthless as he rises up the curses?\nNo. Why would he?\nDaring\u0026rsquo;s plan has worked. My real task, without me even knowing it, has been to flush out his biggest threats. Embracing has people out of their enclave… the disappearance of Enlightened is being discussed everywhere in the hall. Virtuous is calling in favors that are making waves with the daytime folks.\nAnd her too. She\u0026rsquo;s also been pulled in. Pulled off of her island.\nSo be it. She\u0026rsquo;s decided to put her finger on the scales.\nMe. She\u0026rsquo;s putting me on the scales. It\u0026rsquo;s my penance, she said. I have to go back to the hall and report to Daring. He expects me. I\u0026rsquo;ll be let in. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a venom bug setup with me. I just dropped all my credits on it. I can feel it in my slot, eager, ready to expand. Ready to capture every moment, every sound, from every angle.\nEven if I die, the venom bug will broadcast my conversation. I just have to get him talking. He loves to talk. He\u0026rsquo;ll talk himself out of the job.\nCalamity hasn\u0026rsquo;t put a dictator in place in 400 years. He and Grieving will be the Consuls for next year. The clan will continue on.\nThat was her plan.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell her no. I didn\u0026rsquo;t tell her no. I\u0026rsquo;ve got the venom installed. I\u0026rsquo;m walking to Calamity Hall. Almost there.\nWhat will come of me, though? I\u0026rsquo;ll smell as much a rat to Daring as I did to Embracing after this.\nEnd log.\nALYSSA: So I am able– I think that, with a lot of instruction, maybe even a voice in my ear walking me through the process, I am able to get into what was Brahm\u0026rsquo;s apartment, what is now… I think they have to do a full remodel because no one wants to live in a unit where someone was just murdered unless it\u0026rsquo;s got, like, really nice kitchen counters. You know, all the latest tech integrated into this one specific unit. Then, you know, you can really sell it. So it\u0026rsquo;s currently under renovation, and so I\u0026rsquo;m able to get inside past the building security, and then what\u0026rsquo;s left is to trip whatever security that Ferrous would have left.\nI think that the first step there is just looking around. Seeing, I mean– who knows really if he\u0026rsquo;s watching this building soon. His apprentice is dead, so, like, what else is there to watch for, right?\nBut… he\u0026rsquo;s a vampire hunter and he knows how vampires think. And after centuries of living, we can be a little particular, hold on to grudges. So I think that it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that he is still having some watch on the unit.\nAnd so I just go in and start breaking things. And I am going to roll a Vigor to see how successful that is in getting his attention.\n[Shaking dice] Oh, I have to call something– I will call a three. [Dice rolling] That is two fives and a four. So! I fail on this. I\u0026rsquo;m checking how bad of a failure it is… [Die rolling] okay, a five is a tolerable failure with no consequence.\nMATT: Clearly I\u0026rsquo;ve got to go talk to Daring and see what that is. Mostly I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about whether I draw this out or whether I just kind of go right for it…\nI mostly think I\u0026rsquo;ve got to go right for it, and then there\u0026rsquo;ll be maybe a denouement log or something. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how much aftermath there is.\nBut I think it makes sense to do this as a combat… and I think I did the– when I used the adrenaline a few logs ago, I think I did it wrong. Because it says it adds 1d4 to Vigor, so I rolled a 1d4 and got four Vigor, and then I rolled four dice– I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably supposed to be it adds a d6 to your Vigor, i.e. effectively makes your die one.\nSo I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But the point is, is that… so for this encounter, I\u0026rsquo;ve got… the- the venom bug and the venom bug is 3d6 to Insight- or, um, Trauma, so I think that gives me a total of five dice to roll, because I\u0026rsquo;ve set up that I want to use sort of the camera system– the venom bug to kind of broadcast the nefarious plans of the, uh. The guy. Um, so using that as a sort of a combat maneuver, I think is what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do.\nWhat a time to be playing this game where, you know, just bad guys talking about what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do is going to bring them down. Like a… fantasy. It\u0026rsquo;s a fantasy game.\nSATAH: Okay, and so now what? They\u0026rsquo;re going to call in, of course, be like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I got her.\u0026rdquo; What am I– I could try and get away here, like… because they\u0026rsquo;re- they might get distracted on the phone?\nNo… no. Especially since I think the camouflage skin is still off at the moment… be too risky.\nMATT: So I\u0026rsquo;ve got two Trauma. I\u0026rsquo;m adding the venom bug, which is going to add 3d6, so a total of five. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna spend a Fury, obviously, to give myself two picks. And this is going to be, I think, a full combat, so do I succeed, and then what is the damage? A two-part roll.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go with four and one. [Dice rolling] Four and one on 5d6.\nIncredibly, I got nothing. [Die rolling] Punishing consequences.\nBut, uh– let\u0026rsquo;s see about damage. [Die rolling] I did get a success there. So I think I avoid… I do some damage and don\u0026rsquo;t take any myself.\nALYSSA: Breaking things doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. If he is watching the building, maybe, you know, in a day, he\u0026rsquo;ll check some camera feeds and see like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, hey, someone broke into this unit and sure threw a lot of construction material around,\u0026rdquo; but that is not helpful right now for our plan.\nAnd I think that the voices in my head- the voices in my ear, they realise that. And so instead of getting Ferrous\u0026rsquo; attention tonight, the plan shifts to making a date.\nMATT: I inflict wounds with no consequences, but my combat is not successful, and I get punishing consequences as a result.\nAlright, I think what makes sense then is for some sort of other enforcers to show up, so let\u0026rsquo;s roll on threats.\n[Die rolling] More vampire hunters. Perhaps the vampire hunters were with him all along. [Die rolling] Six! Six vampire hunters. Lovely. What- how is that going to go? I have no idea. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to roll to even… kind of bring this- bring this to the next obvious thing.\nI do have the events table. Is there some other secret plan that might interrupt this? Or… I\u0026rsquo;m looking at the karma table again. I had only used it at the beginning. I do want to check in again with that one. Maybe now is the time.\nALYSSA: So in the mess I have made of this in-progress unit, I get to leave him a little note. And on it is just the symbol of the Calamity and a GPS point of where to meet.\nAnd where is it that we do want to set our date with Ferrous? Gonna roll on the location table. [Die rolling] That is a six. That is the Gardens again. So we\u0026rsquo;re asking him to come back. You saw us here. Let\u0026rsquo;s meet. It\u0026rsquo;s… neutral ground. It\u0026rsquo;s not neutral, but, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s as good a place as any and the poetry is calling to me, even if I don\u0026rsquo;t quite understand why.\nMATT: Three. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re consumed by rage.\u0026rdquo; I think that\u0026rsquo;s right. Um, but do I… well, I already suffered a punishing consequence, so I think, um… yeah. I think this is- this is bad news. This is like– the vampire working with the vampire hunters doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem great, but I failed to fully expose the situation, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to get memory holed somewhere, then… what makes sense for me to be talking about that later? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to think about that. When- what context is this actual record happening in? I\u0026rsquo;m going to think about it a little bit, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll get something written up, and then you\u0026rsquo;ll hear the log.\nALYSSA: So we set a date for the next night. Leave a message in the unit. Conspicuously leave the unit. Conspicuously don\u0026rsquo;t set up watching devices within it. We want him to feel as confident as possible going into this.\nAnd I go back to the unit that the Calamity is renting in the building and I wait. And because I have my technology back and am feeling a little bit spicy, I think that I am going to record a third log.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Log 010, the Praug file.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if this file is even relevant anymore. I mean… I technically have already reported to Praetor Halakarnassus.\nI\u0026rsquo;m shielded here… wherever here is. I assume an oubliette under the hall?\nI can\u0026rsquo;t get to the network. Can\u0026rsquo;t see if our ploy worked. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard anything in at least a day. That\u0026rsquo;s how long I\u0026rsquo;ve been awake. I may have been out for a while before that. Who can say? Just darkness here. There\u0026rsquo;s no door.\nIt all happened like Miss Praug said it would. I went in, got shown to the Praetor. He was well aware of the waves that I\u0026rsquo;d been making, but he hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard that I\u0026rsquo;d actually gotten to see Miss Praug. That seemed to surprise him.\nPut out my venom system, and I tried to draw him on what he wanted her for. What, really? This was never a welfare check, I said.\nHe was unimpressed with my questions. At a bell, he had hunters in the room. Wilson had a whole fresh crew, and they weren\u0026rsquo;t going to let me get the drop on them this time.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t make it easy for them. I went full rage. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to live, sohere was nothing to hold back. I got a taste of one or two– nothing significant. There were too many.\nAnd Holocarnassus at his desk, chuckling the whole time.\nThe hunters had UV truncheons.\nI guess the venom bug got all that recorded and transmitted. The rest of the clan won\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of a Praetor being friends with hunters… I mean, maybe. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll love it.\nThe last thing I remember was seeing the Praetor crush one of the venom micro-drones right in my face. The other isn\u0026rsquo;t here either. So…\nMy cyberware is down to 5%. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably been here a while.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll probably be here a while.\nEnd log.\nALYSSA: Log 003.\nThey call us monsters, but how little humanity they must have to let this space be further despoiled. Does he feel so little for the student that he trained?\nSATAH: They call it in and they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll bring her in.\u0026rdquo; And… still with that, like, device pressed to my body, they move me along the hall to an elevator.\nAnother elevator, huh? A lot of elevators in this story. [Laughs] Everybody should read, um, The Intuitionist by Colson Whitehead for an insane, uh, incredible- fucking incredible speculative fiction book that heavily features elevators. It\u0026rsquo;s– oh man. I have- I will talk about this book for a long time, but just go read it.\nALYSSA: I\u0026rsquo;m sitting at six Fury right now, which feels good. Initially, I thought that seven was a lot, and then I did my first encounter and thought that it was way too little and I was going to immediately die, but now I\u0026rsquo;m feeling pretty good about it. I think that I will survive. Uh, knock on wood– I totally just cursed myself. But we will see what happens.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m pulled into this elevator.\nI managed to disable the tracker, which means I know that if I can get away, I might actually be able to get away. But this is a- this is a rough situation that I\u0026rsquo;m in.\nALYSSA: The rest of the team is in hiding. We want this to seem like it is just me, and it\u0026rsquo;s believable that it\u0026rsquo;s just me because it was just me the first time.\nWhile they are in hiding, we do have some affiliates outside, watching the building, and so I hear that Ferrous has entered.\nSATAH: Oh, I think I know my angle here.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re in this elevator. [Laughs] And I\u0026rsquo;m just going to start talking. Because they know why I\u0026rsquo;m here. They know that I overheard this conversation, and they know the conversation. Like we kind of established that with- with me trying to be like, \u0026ldquo;Are you important enough to know or are you stupid and suck?\u0026rdquo; And they were like, \u0026ldquo;No… I\u0026rsquo;m not. I\u0026rsquo;m not stupid and I don\u0026rsquo;t suck. And that doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother me.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs] earlier. Um.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s actually kind of fun for me that I get to talk out loud about the situation. Like, I\u0026rsquo;ve been- I\u0026rsquo;ve been occasionally messaging Klysm about it, right? But it always has to be encoded. And so it\u0026rsquo;s, like, kind of exciting for me to be like, \u0026ldquo;Hey. So this fucking plan, huh?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think the thing I want to do here is just start… I want to try and, like… make this person think that it would be bad for them if this deal went through.\nALYSSA: It\u0026rsquo;s time for the final confrontation. And I go into Brahm\u0026rsquo;s apartment. And I wait.\nMATT: Alright. I\u0026rsquo;m about to make the eleventh log, and… I think I\u0026rsquo;ve accelerated through the second half of the story a little too quickly. You know, for better or for worse. And– certainly where I left Imperius was not really able to impact the story much anymore, so, you know, going back to the rules of the game, like, \u0026ldquo;You make your own fate,\u0026rdquo; so, like– I set out to find Charitable, uh, and I did. And so I think this story is over. So I think this post eleven is sort of an epilogue.\nSo that being said, I was debating about whether or not to actually make any rolls for this one, but I think I do want to… just a little bit of guidance for, uh, some of the closing narration that I have in mind.\nALYSSA: I think that there are so many ways to do this more… efficiently. To make it so that I\u0026rsquo;m not just bait. I am the one who is able to catch the vampire hunter and prove myself to the Calamity. Prove that I\u0026rsquo;m still worth keeping around.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s really not where my head is at. I have been stewing in rage with nothing to do for god knows how much time. And all I want at this point is to face the person who killed Ayla and return the favour.\nAnd I need him to know that I\u0026rsquo;m the one who did it. So rather than taking up any sort of tactical position, I wait in the center of the room, weaponless, ready to end this person with my own two hands, just like I did to their apprentice.\nSATAH: We\u0026rsquo;re in this- we\u0026rsquo;re in the elevator, and we\u0026rsquo;re- I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;So, this sale… seems like it\u0026rsquo;s really important that they keep it under wraps, huh?\u0026rdquo;\nThe agent kind of shrugs.\nI\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I mean, I can see why. Like… they probably kind of don\u0026rsquo;t want the rest of the company to know, huh? I assume that\u0026rsquo;s really the problem; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter if other people figure out it\u0026rsquo;s happening, but… you don\u0026rsquo;t exactly want that to leak internally before you\u0026rsquo;re ready, right?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Speck is like, \u0026quot; … Oh. Because you\u0026rsquo;re going to lose your fucking jobs.\u0026quot; And they kind of go still, and she\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I mean… you know that, right? They\u0026rsquo;re not going to keep the whole team. They\u0026rsquo;re barely going to keep anybody. It\u0026rsquo;ll be a government program– can you pass a security clearance? [Chuckles] Because I don\u0026rsquo;t think most– at this point, if you are as… important to the company as it seems like you are, I bet you\u0026rsquo;ve done some things that mean you can\u0026rsquo;t. So… where do you think your place is going to be in all of this?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll with advantage. Because it\u0026rsquo;s a bad, hard world, and the idea that- this person is suddenly dealing with the idea that they might lose their job and they\u0026rsquo;re like, fuuuuuck. That\u0026rsquo;s, like, a genuine threat.\nALYSSA: I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and roll Vigor to see how that goes at the start. I have Fury, so I think that this is as good a time as any as to use it. I will call twos and threes for this roll. I\u0026rsquo;m rolling three dice. [Dice rolling] That is a four, a three, and a six. So that is a success.\nUm, I think that it takes a moment for Ferrous to be processed through the building. Weird how he\u0026rsquo;s on the guest list, not for this unit, but the one that we own.\nAnd after a few minutes, the door creaks open… no, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t creak. The door slams open and I immediately shot in the chest. Or– I would be if I didn\u0026rsquo;t hear him coming regardless and managed to dodge out of the way. But it seems that Farrous is really not, um, waiting around to talk. He definitely expected danger coming in and he is coming in full throttle.\nI think I will go ahead and roll Vigor again for this combat. Not going to spend anything, but this time I will roll- or I will bet, rather, a one. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to try and see how the rest of this fight goes before the rest of the Calamity gets involved.\n[Dice rolling] That is two sixes and a two, which is a failure. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and roll for wound or for failure- how impacted I am. [Die rolling] That is a three. Failure, punishing consequence.\nSATAH: So I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll 4d6, and– you know what? I\u0026rsquo;m gonna spend… I\u0026rsquo;m gonna spend a Fury on it. Down to one… pretty- pretty rough. But if I succeed at this roll, I\u0026rsquo;ll get it back. So.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to roll a three or a five. [Dice rolling] Nice. Rolled a one and a five… [Dice rolling] and a two and a two. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter; rolled a five.\nALYSSA: I dodge the first attack but immediately, I think, get hit by the second. And I\u0026rsquo;m wounded. And I\u0026rsquo;m poisoned again, something a little stronger, a little faster acting than whatever it is that Brahm had on his bullets. But more than that is the fact that my earpiece is, I think, just shot right out of my ear, or rather my ear is shot and my earpiece goes with it.\nUm, which means I don\u0026rsquo;t have contact with the rest of the team. And in the scenario planning here, we had talked about communication jams and the solution was a timer, and so I\u0026rsquo;m now stuck in this room with a very angry vampire hunter on my own without support for several minutes, and I have to keep him here with me. I can\u0026rsquo;t flee, and I can\u0026rsquo;t be loud enough that I provoke other responses. I mean, we took out unit security for this unit, but you can\u0026rsquo;t control neighbours, can\u0026rsquo;t put a whole comms block on the building because then it would be obvious something were happening. So it\u0026rsquo;s just the two of us, and… it\u0026rsquo;s what I wanted, but it\u0026rsquo;s really not working out how I wanted it to at all.\nMATT: So one thing I think is going to happen is I think there\u0026rsquo;s I think there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a major time jump, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll on events to see, like, one thing that might have happened in that time.\n[Die roll] The Valamity seeks vengeance. That seems appropriate and interesting.\nALYSSA: Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and roll one last Vigor, sort of wrapping up when the rest of my team gets here. Um, this time I will call a four. [Dice rolling] That is two threes and a one! Uh, so, rolling for my failure… [Die rolling] that is a two. Failure with punishing consequence.\nI am really getting hurt here. And I think that the biggest consequence I can have is, honestly, being knocked out of this fight. I built this conflict so much in my head and my heart, and I was convinced that if I could face them and let them see the hurt that they had did and then kill them for it, that pain would be… not soothed– I mean, nothing can replace the hole that Ayla has left in my life– but it would be mitigated, at least. It would be some sense of closure. And when you\u0026rsquo;re an immortal being, you need all the closure you can get.\nSATAH: The thing is. When you overcome a challenge with advantage, you \u0026ldquo;kill to feed. Kill someone and feed on them. Take note of the victim\u0026rsquo;s name and describe the hunt.\u0026rdquo; And I think we know who this is going to be, right? Let\u0026rsquo;s get a name for this agent real quick.\nZane Vortex? Holy shit, what a name. Yeah.\nALYSSA: I don\u0026rsquo;t even have the chance to be wrong, the chance to kill him with my own two hands and then realise, \u0026ldquo;Oh, revenge doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve anything.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat happens is that I\u0026rsquo;m able to keep him occupied for a minute of the time that the Calamity needs, but I\u0026rsquo;m not keeping it quiet enough. And I\u0026rsquo;ll learn later that someone from the unit below called building security, and that is what brought my team into action. That is what spurred them to join me, to save me. Because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t good enough, because I needed them to jump in and rectify my errors. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t… concern for me and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t me holding out. It was all because a neighbour tried to call security and they needed to take care of my mess.\nSo they don\u0026rsquo;t wait the full time. They come into the room and by sheer force of numbers are able to overwhelm the vampire hunter and are able to do it in short enough time that they get out, get back to our unit, and bring me with them. But, of course… I\u0026rsquo;m bleeding out. Unconscious from the lack of blood.\nMATT: I\u0026rsquo;m also going to roll on a location because I think, uh you know. Where has Imperius been? Where is he now? I think we\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens there.\n[Die rolling] I got Drip Nightclub again. That\u0026rsquo;s not a perfect fit, but it is, I think, appropriate. Or I can make it appropriate. I can work that in. I can work that in.\nSATAH: This is done in a pretty shitty way.\nZane suddenly is convinced. Realises like, \u0026ldquo;Well, fuck. Yeah. Why am I helping them get you when absolutely they will just fire me? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to look for another job. This sucks.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so they take this, uh, weird device off of my body. And I think they\u0026rsquo;re, like, starting to be like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, so uh… just make it look real. Like, punch me in the face,\u0026rdquo; And then, \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s the code,\u0026rdquo; like, \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s how to hack this elevator to make it go back down–\u0026rdquo; Because here\u0026rsquo;s the other thing. The elevator has been going up. I would like it to go down.\nAnd she\u0026rsquo;s, like, giving me this information. And I\u0026rsquo;m, like, nodding understandably and, like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then, yeah, they\u0026rsquo;re, like, \u0026ldquo;Okay! [Exhales sharply] I hate having to do this. Okay,\u0026rdquo; and they, like, close their eyes for me to punch them in the face.\nAnd instead, I, like– the device that they were holding to me, I turn on them, and they just– their \u0026lsquo;ware gets fried, and, uh, I feed on them! Like, they- this, like, jolt of electricity runs through them, and I just, like, you know, very homoerotically catch them in my arms, tilt their neck back, and, uhh, drink- drink their corporate blood. [Chuckles] And I get a Fury back. Great. Two out of five.\nMATT: And the last roll that I want to make is I want to kind of test– given the time jump, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make another wager and see sort of as, like, how did- how did Imperius fare being so out of the action, so to speak, for this extended period of time?\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m going to test Insight. [Tapping the desk in thought] I think it is Insight. I think it is sort of, like, a sort of- a- can Imperius kind of get into a self-reflective mode to survive? And I think the karma that I rolled in the last session was that I got knocked into a rage. So I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of what I\u0026rsquo;m testing is that… can that be focused in a survival sort of sense?\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve got two dice on Insight. I\u0026rsquo;ve got Fury to spend. I guess I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend a Fury to give myself… one and four. [Dice rolling, long exhale] I did it. It came up as a one. Alright.\nSATAH: Great. I can take control of the elevator. I am going to do it. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll– I think I can roll this with advantage. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll to fill up my escape the tower clock. I\u0026rsquo;m going to roll 1d6… I\u0026rsquo;m gonna roll 2d6 take the highest, \u0026lsquo;cause I- I\u0026rsquo;m home free. I have no tracker. Zane gave me the code before I killed them. [Laughs]\n[Dice rolling] Four… and a five. I\u0026rsquo;m good to go, baby!\nALYSSA: As far as I know, the vampire hunter just disappears. I had done my part in this plan, acted as bait, but I have lost their trust, and so I\u0026rsquo;m not brought into the rest of it.\nAnd that pattern… continues.\nThey don\u0026rsquo;t know if they can trust me and feeling that disbelief, that lack of faith, and knowing that that is what this family is about and without that, am I even a part of the family anymore? That is what I\u0026rsquo;m having to live with as I have survived, somehow, with five Fury left… but, really, without a place in this structure.\nSATAH: I take the elevator all the way to the floor and step out, wiping my mouth delicately and sexily. Zane is just collapsed dead on the floor behind me.\nALYSSA: Maybe that means that what it\u0026rsquo;s really time for is for me to leave the Calamity as a whole, but… that would be another adventure.\nMATT: Imperius has… not failed this psychological ordeal, so I think that\u0026rsquo;s good.\nSATAH: And I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna write one more log.\nMATT: That\u0026rsquo;ll definitely impact how I make the final epilogue narration.\nSATAH: And I believe that that\u0026rsquo;s going to be game. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be right back. It\u0026rsquo;s a fast one.\nMATT: All right. Well, I\u0026rsquo;m going to get to it.\nALYSSA: I think it is time to record my final log.\nSATAH: Okay. So I wrote two more logs because I, uh- I don\u0026rsquo;t like the number four, and so I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to end on four logs, but I think this is perfect. So log 004 is: \u0026ldquo;Boss. Scratch last. All good. Want me to pick anything up on my way home?\u0026rdquo; [Laughs] And then log 005…\nMATT: Log 011.\nALYSSA: Log 004.\nSATAH: [Switching between a robotic voice and character voice] KT_SPECK transfer request: 50 credits. Accept?\nKT_SPECK: My tab.\nKT_SPECK: Plus inconvenience fee.\nTRAINR accepted transfer request: 50 credits.\nTRAINR: You\u0026rsquo;ve not heard the last of this from me.\nKT_SPECK: Granted. Convo I wanted to have might make it up to you with the juice of the info… ping me tonight?\nALYSSA, AS TISIPHONY: We did it. I suppose. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel much like victory… it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel much like \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo;, really, to be honest.\nI think I have to abandon this inbox. Silver\u0026rsquo;s been giving me looks, and… I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t trust that I can maintain the security. Not without you.\nI love you, Ayla. But I think it might be time for me to get out of this town.\nMATT, AS IMPERIUS: Year 3137 of the Calamity. The year of Consoles Torino and Torino. End of the Praug file.\nHow many thousand thousand speeches and logs and books and reports have gone unrecorded while I laid forgotten? I stopped counting… and then I forgot most of them anyway.\nStrange to make one last recording on this device. I am overdue for an upgrade. Clan leadership said I am owed a bit of compensation for the ills of the past few years. They said I\u0026rsquo;ll have a flat above the Drip. Very fashionable. Seems it never closed. The party never stopped there, not even when we went to war with the other clans.\nRevenge cost too much in the end. Under new management now… both the Drip and the clan.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve become something of a folk hero in the meanwhile. I can only imagine it was Sol\u0026rsquo;s– … Console Torino\u0026rsquo;s doing.\nWhy was my story any more important than anyone else who was actually in the fight? Why is spinning my story working in their favour? \u0026ldquo;The first casualty of the new regime wasn\u0026rsquo;t even really killed,\u0026rdquo; they\u0026rsquo;ve been saying. \u0026ldquo;He was always a liar,\u0026rdquo; they\u0026rsquo;ve been harping on. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like much of a winning story.\n\u0026ldquo;Pioneering investigator with a famous name among former king\u0026rsquo;s first victims!\u0026rdquo; Just new lies for a new age.\nThey are going to make me an Aedile, though… I\u0026rsquo;m overdue for an upgrade.\nAt least I\u0026rsquo;ll remember that I\u0026rsquo;m not the first, and certainly not the only one he put in a hole. They\u0026rsquo;re who I want to talk to– the ones who can still manage a conversation. They\u0026rsquo;ll be my faction.\nSeems Praug didn\u0026rsquo;t make it. At least not physically. Most of her is on the network, though. I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk to whatever\u0026rsquo;s left, if she\u0026rsquo;ll meet me.\nI thought about her twilight bunker a lot. Maybe I just imagined it. Imagined the orange light, the yellow sky, somehow walked that field of grass to its infinity\u0026rsquo;s edge… maybe.\nOr maybe I really went there.\nEnd log.\nSATAH: And that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nALYSSA: And I think that\u0026rsquo;s how we close.\nSATAH: I think that\u0026rsquo;s my game for today. I– certainly would like– I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve built a nice web of fuckin\u0026rsquo; circumstances and situations, that Speck has certainly made some enemies, which is great. [Laughs]\nALYSSA: Tisiphony has kind of found revenge? Not really. There were some unnamed consequences for the object of her vengeance, but she had no part in that and got no catharsis from it. But, you know, sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s just how it goes, I guess. She lives on and maybe she\u0026rsquo;ll be out to join one of the other gangs someday.\nSATAH: And so it would be really easy to keep going, do more sessions of this, do a whole campaign.\nALYSSA: Let\u0026rsquo;s see. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at \u0026rsquo;em. I think that she could be a great Balthram. Not at all trustworthy.\nSATAH: This is very, very fun. Just so stylish as a system. Like, it looks beautiful.\nALYSSA: Yeah, no, this was fun. It was a lot more open– open-ended, I mean– than a lot of games I play. Very, very self-directed. Unless you die, there\u0026rsquo;s no distinct ending, and there aren\u0026rsquo;t really prompts so much as there are a sort of set of lists through which you can build your own encounters. So that was interesting.\nMATT: I get to the end and I\u0026rsquo;m happy with the story that I created, and I created it by responding to the scaffolding of the game. But, you know– it\u0026rsquo;s only about three pages of typed material. You know, for the amount of content that it is, the theme is very strong with both the vampire shenanigans and the sort of cyberpunk trappings. It\u0026rsquo;s dense in that way. Very dense. Very small, dense object.\nSATAH: Sorry that I\u0026rsquo;m clicking in the background. My ADHD medication wore off while I was recording this, and I was keeping track of a bunch of my results in a table, and if I don\u0026rsquo;t format the table right now… I don\u0026rsquo;t know what will happen because it\u0026rsquo;s apparently not an option. So! That\u0026rsquo;s the game.\nMATT: And I feel like I prefer a game where I\u0026rsquo;m responding not to– you know, pulling stuff out of my own brain, but like, you know, legitimately responding to a world that the designer has created through the game. So I felt that less strongly here. But then, you know, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have created this story that I like if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for this game, so…\nALYSSA: I\u0026rsquo;m sorry that I took it to sad lesbian vengeance, rather than something more cyberpunk, like happy lesbian vengeance. But no, I had a lot of fun with it!\nSATAH: Okay. Good luck out there, Speck. You\u0026rsquo;re a fucking nightmare. [Laughs]\nALYSSA: But yeah, thanks so much for having me.\nSATAH: That\u0026rsquo;s it! That\u0026rsquo;s Furyya.

The other two lonesome expectant mothers holding down the literal forts with me are Happy Birthday and Chloe Sobel. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a little bit more about them at the break.\nGAME: ACT ZERO CHLOE: Okay.\nHB: Alright. We are returning to Folio.\nSATAH: Podcaster cursed to live in the loudest neighbourhood of all time.\nCHLOE: Yeah. Hi, this is Chloe. I\u0026rsquo;m playing To Honour and Obey.\nHB: And our game for today is Honour and Obey by Laurie O \u0026lsquo;Connel.\nSATAH: Gonna play To Honour And Obey…\nHB: Or– To Honour and Obey by Laurie O\u0026rsquo;Connel.\nSATAH: The tagline of which on the very first page is, \u0026ldquo;a solo game about an Arthurian lady protecting her own.\u0026rdquo;\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;A solo game about an Arthurian lady protecting her own.\u0026rdquo;\nHB: Which is \u0026ldquo;a solo game about an Arthurian lady protecting her own.\u0026rdquo; You know, let\u0026rsquo;s just launch into this by reading the opening.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;You were granted this keep only two months ago.\nHB: \u0026ldquo;You were granted this keep only two months ago.\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;You were granted this keep only two months ago.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Well, your husband was.\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;Well, your husband was.\nHB: \u0026ldquo;Well… your husband was. A gift from King Arthur for some noble act of gallantry and knightly service, no doubt.\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;And yet today he is leaving again on some long and magical quest, and you don\u0026rsquo;t know if or when he will be back.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;He left you with only two things: a baby boy in your belly and a request to look after the keep while he\u0026rsquo;s gone. If only things were so easy.\nHB: \u0026ldquo;The people here have no particular loyalty to you, and the keep is a wreck, left derelict by its previous occupants.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;The crows are flocking, and you know that your enemies are plotting against you. You have nobody here to protect you, only a few maidservants and a husband and family far away.\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;But for all intents and purposes, this is your castle, and\nALL THREE: \u0026ldquo;you will do your best\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;to rebuild it and keep it strong.\nHB: \u0026ldquo;and keep it strong.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;and keep it strong.\u0026rdquo;\nHB: This is an Anamnesis game, which means that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be playing this by essentially drawing tarot cards to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s going on. In our case, we are a pregnant woman in an Arthurian setting who is trying her best to survive… about the next nine months of her life in a honestly quite challenging situation.\nSATAH: This game is so out of my comfort zone that I actually got a little bit nauseous. [Laughs] It\u0026rsquo;s beautifully written! But saying that a man… left me with a child?! That I\u0026rsquo;m pregnant with a man\u0026rsquo;s child?! Genuinely made me, like, deeply physically uncomfortable to say.\nCHLOE: I\u0026rsquo;m so excited about this. I love… I love women struggling in patriarchal situations and I love medieval bullshit. Arthuriana is not, like, my strength, but I feel like I have a good enough grasp of the vibes to really have fun with this.\nSATAH: I have nightmares about pregnancy. I really hope that I can get through it. Because I would love to appreciate the, like, writing of this game and other parts of it, but, oh man.\nHB: Our deck is separated into five decks. Major Arcana, Wands, Swords, Cups, and Pentacles.\nSATAH: Need a tarot deck, piece of paper, a set of tokens of any kind… ooh, tokens.\nGot a little glass jar of flower beads.\nCHLOE: So I\u0026rsquo;ve set up my tarot deck. I could have played this online on playingcards io, but instead I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to finally break out my Mage the Awakening tarot deck that I got printed on DriveThruRPG years and years ago, and I\u0026rsquo;ve never touched it. And I can tell because when I opened the deck, everything was in the proper order.\nSATAH: I am using the absolutely beautiful Wanderers deck by Casey Zabala, which I won in a game on a cottage trip a few years ago, I believe. It has slightly different suits and slightly different court cards, but they all align cleanly to your classic Tarot, so should not be a problem.\nCHLOE: Got my deck and I\u0026rsquo;ve got- I\u0026rsquo;ve got- I\u0026rsquo;ve got a coffee, so I\u0026rsquo;m good.\nHB: And we can just launch right into it.\nSTRENGTH SATAH: Going to do act zero, establishing the set.\nHB: First, what we need to do is define our lady a little bit. And to do that, we need to identify a strength and an enemy. And to do that, we draw from the Major Arcana deck.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Draw a card from the major arcana and place it faced first in front of you. This is your strength. Use the card to describe the talents, qualities, skills, or secrets that you have that you rely on to survive.\u0026rdquo; Cool. Okay. I\u0026rsquo;m going to shuffle…\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;Whenever you use your strength to confront a problem, you will place a token upon the card.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: These cards have like this beautiful silver, like, filigree finish on the sides, kind of like you\u0026rsquo;d see a fancy book with shiny edges of the pages? And they\u0026rsquo;re just– they just, like, shine so dramatically while being shuffled. It looks like– it looks a little bit, honestly, what it looks like- honestly, what it kind of looks like is something that would have been in Hannibal. Like, Mads Mikkelsen just chopping really fast– that\u0026rsquo;s the vibe that you get visually when shuffling these cards.\nHB: Let\u0026rsquo;s draw a major arcana here.\nSATAH: I have drawn the Hermit.\nCHLOE: So I have drawn for my strength the Hierophant, a beautiful card that I think would be at home, if the colours were a little different, i n the H .R. Giger Museum.\nHB: [Cracking up] It is the Tower. Amazing. Oh, god, what a first card to draw. We g– that\u0026rsquo;s our strength. Oh my god.\nCHLOE: So I have to look up what the fuck the Hierophant means. I should know this… and yet.\nSATAH: I think just for fun, I\u0026rsquo;m going to directly consult the, like, guidebook that came with this deck to sort of guide me towards my answers? And so what it says for the Hermit is \u0026ldquo;directed by truth, following inner light.\u0026rdquo; Interesting. Okay.\nCHLOE: Okay. No, this is actually- I think this is relatively easy because Hierophants are, you know, connected to religion.\nVery funny that it used to be apparently identified as the Pope in early decks and I\u0026rsquo;m doing this right after the new Pope got elected. I\u0026rsquo;m not Catholic or even Christian, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been really enjoying the memes about it.\nHB: Our strength is the Tower. In the context of being an Arthurian lady, what could this possibly mean? Is it that we have, like, you know… not necessarily any sort of… is it that we are unprincipled? That we have no compunctions? We will just destroy everything if we, you know, really have to? Let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nSATAH: The example strengths that are given are, \u0026ldquo;My blood hums with ancestral magic,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I learned politics at my mother\u0026rsquo;s knee and can read anyone\u0026rsquo;s intentions,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;My obvious virtue and kindness makes it hard to oppose my wishes.\u0026rdquo; So it sounds like I should write sort of a- a statement that sums this up. Something about truth and being guided by an inner light.\nThe inclusion of \u0026ldquo;my blood hums with ancestral magic in the example strengths\u0026rdquo; does… feel like it is giving me explicit permission to sort of genre this up a bit, which I think will genuinely help me be more comfortable with it? And I like that idea, so…\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;The Hierophant stands for righteousness, sacredness…\u0026rdquo; um, so I think in this case– oh, and it also apparently, according to Waite\u0026rsquo;s Key to the Tarot, \u0026ldquo;it carries several divinatory associations, including marriage, alliance, captivity, servitude… by another account, mercy and goodness, inspiration, the man to whom the Quirin has recourse…\u0026rdquo; This is fun because– yeah.\nSo I think that in that case, my character\u0026rsquo;s strength is her faith. And I think that another of her strengths is her marriage. I think that, um… I trust in my faith to guide me– and it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily like a faith in, like, God, although I think that is an element because, you know, again, this is an Arthurian thing, so that is present, like, the religiosity– but I think a faith in my own mind and intuition? Yeah.\nAnd I think that like– so, despite it all, despite my husband being called away to this, whatever it is that he\u0026rsquo;s doing exactly, I guess we\u0026rsquo;ll sort of find out as this goes on– yeah, I still I have faith in him. And I have faith that I made the right choice by marrying him. Like it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been entirely my choice, but I- I think I had the- I had the power to say no. And I met him and I was like, \u0026ldquo;This is where I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be going.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Directed by truth, following inner light…\u0026rdquo; I think I\u0026rsquo;m gonna say that I have visions.\nAnd I think they\u0026rsquo;re small. And I think that… because of the the thing of of it saying, \u0026ldquo;directed by inner light,\u0026rdquo; I do think I want to play with the idea of light and that made me– I was, like, toying around with different sort of ways to say it and I was like– something about, like, \u0026ldquo;in the light of the sun, I can always see the truth,\u0026rdquo; and I think it\u0026rsquo;s like… [Laughs] I think- I think that I\u0026rsquo;m constructing Realis sentences in my brain, actually. Like, it\u0026rsquo;s, \u0026ldquo;I can always see the truth,\u0026rdquo; and then it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I can always see the truth in the light of the afternoon,\u0026rdquo; and then it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;I can always see the light of the truth in the afternoon across my bedroom wall,\u0026rdquo; or something like that.\nI do have to remember: this is a strength. I\u0026rsquo;m going to pull a weakness. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to complicate this. This can be relatively straightforward.\nHB: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s associated with sudden disruptive revelation and potentially destructive change.\u0026rdquo; Yeah, I think… I want to say that this means that we have lost everything once before. That we were lifted out of a terrible situation by, you know, marrying our husband. We have a- we are no stranger to hardship. We have a… you know, our keep has burned down before in the past. That is something that, in our short life, we have already experienced. I already have a sense that… the worst has already happened to me once. If it happens again, I will be prepared. I am not, uh… I am not unused to being surrounded by disaster and death and plague and misery.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s like the keep that I used to be from got fully razed in a siege? You know, that kind of situation. Maybe my husband is even like, you know, a former enemy of King Arthur that was defeated and, like, added to his retinue. And I happen to be his wife from that same- from roughly that same group of people. Where there\u0026rsquo;s a, you know. My husband is, like, half giant and maybe I\u0026rsquo;m like… maybe I am his bride who is, like, you know, the offspring of witches or something like that, and there is a really ominous… I have a really ominous ancestry that has resulted in me being on the wrong side of a conflict.\nSo yeah, I think that\u0026rsquo;s my strength. My strength is the Tower. I\u0026rsquo;ve been destroyed once before. When it happens again, I will be ready.\nSATAH: [Typing] Okay. I just sort of, like, tooled around with a sentence for a little while, and what I\u0026rsquo;ve landed on for strength is, \u0026ldquo;Visions in the fires of candles in the sun…\u0026rdquo; oh, wait, I\u0026rsquo;ve said visions twice. One second. Let me rewrite this a little… there we go.\n\u0026ldquo;The fires of candles in the sun grant me visions of the likeliest answers to my questions.\u0026rdquo; So it\u0026rsquo;s a very limited-in-scope future reading ability. And I like to think it\u0026rsquo;s the type of thing where, like, if I were to, you know, interrogate somebody by candlelight, it would help me understand if they\u0026rsquo;re lying and that kind of thing? I think that\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nENEMY HB: Now, we need to identify our enemy.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;Draw a second card from the Major Arcana and place it to the right of the first card, reversed. This is your enemy.\nHB: \u0026ldquo;While there are many crows circling your keep, your position, and your son\u0026rsquo;s inheritance, one of them is the most dangerous. Use the card to describe them.\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;Whenever the cards confront you with a problem that you do not know how to solve, or you deal with the problem badly, or are forced to act in desperation, you will place a token on this card.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;These decisions are up to you, with one exception: if a card is drawn reversed, your enemy always gains a token. Describe how your clever solution to the problem in front of you puts you in a bad situation.\u0026rdquo; Wonderful. I always want tarot games to play with inversions, because I think that that is just such a fantastic element of tarot.\nHB: Now, one of the issues that I have is they don\u0026rsquo;t think I can actually draw a card reversed in this deck because I\u0026rsquo;m using a digital deck and that is not… really a feature of this particular thing. But I think, you know… I don\u0026rsquo;t mind making a decision. After all, I am very good at self-sabotage.\nSATAH: Let\u0026rsquo;s find out who this enemy is. I pulled it reversed, so that\u0026rsquo;s looking good.\nCHLOE: Oh no! My en– I drew the lovers for my enemy. That\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating pull.\nHB: The World! Oh my god. [Laughing]\nSATAH: The Moon… that\u0026rsquo;s immediately really interesting to me because of how I invoked the sun as a strength. Like, the fire of the sun. That\u0026rsquo;s cool.\nHB: Yeah, okay.\nCHLOE: Gosh, okay.\nSATAH: Example enemies. \u0026ldquo;My cousin has always hated me and wants everything I have.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;My husband\u0026rsquo;s rival, Sir Nilvain, covets the lands we\u0026rsquo;ve been given to protect.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;A wicked magician desires me and will do anything to have me in his power.\u0026rdquo;\nCHLOE: The lovers. So the Waite associations here are \u0026ldquo;failure, foolish designs, sometimes marriage frustrated, and contrarities of all kinds.\u0026rdquo; So I think that my enemy here is the man I didn\u0026rsquo;t marry, who I think is also a knight. No, actually, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go with, uh– he\u0026rsquo;s not a knight. He\u0026rsquo;s a wicked magician because that\u0026rsquo;s one of the example enemies in the booklet, and I\u0026rsquo;m really drawn to it. \u0026ldquo;A wicked magician desires me and will do anything to have me in his power,\u0026rdquo; having already lost me to my husband. I think he had plans and schemes going on, and then I did not choose him because my intuition told me not to.\nSATAH: What does the book say about the Moon? \u0026ldquo;Introspect, dream, recollect.\u0026rdquo;\nMmm. Immediately, I\u0026rsquo;m like… you know, I should do the thing that I was already obviously drawn to do. I kept trying to complicate the idea of having visions being good, because that\u0026rsquo;s often complicated, right? So that\u0026rsquo;s like, you know, can I actually trust them? But I do want it to be a strength.\nSo I think, specifically thinking of the idea of dreams… and do I want this to be… this is a person. Yes, right. Okay. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a weakness. This is a person. Okay.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m leaning into sort of a fantastical thing… you know, genre stuff… which I guess, like, to be totally fair, this is an Arthurian tale, right? So of course there\u0026rsquo;s magic. Like, that isn\u0026rsquo;t me just, like, throwing a whole new thing in there. i\u0026rsquo;m just probably going to lean really hard into that because it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s where I find a little bit more comfort.\nWhy was I bringing that up?\nThe idea of my- my– this enemy being a- a woman who\u0026rsquo;s been appearing to me in my dreams. And I\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out if I know what she wants.\nI find the conceit of this game so inherently, like, oppressive and suffocating that I really can only conceptualise… or my first instincts of conceptualising an enemy is somebody who is telling me that I deserve more than this and trying to show me a way out, which scares me, but is good. Is that what I want? Do I want this to be like, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s a woman appearing in my dreams being like, \u0026ldquo;You are powerful. Why is this what you\u0026rsquo;re doing?\u0026rdquo; Like, \u0026ldquo;Your husband is not the only one in the home who could save the world.\u0026rdquo;\nI have to remember I have a child… and want to be a mother, presumably… [Laughing] It\u0026rsquo;s so funny the- the specific limits of my imagination. Okay.\nHB: I think the World in this case is… maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a prophecy. Like a prophecy relating to my faith or my bloodline or something like that? Yeah. I think it\u0026rsquo;s that my fate is fixed, is my enemy. There is… I\u0026rsquo;m no stranger to ruin, but that is because it is part of a prophecy that, you know, my entire family will be destroyed, my fate will be erased. There will be a, uh… there is a sense of unchanging doom about me. There will never be a, uh- there is not a– at least as far as the soothsayers are concerned, everything that I do will end badly, so to speak. I think if somebody tries to divine my future, it will necessarily end badly. Like, it is a, uh, oh, I, you know, \u0026ldquo;I look into your future and I see a horrible darkness.\u0026rdquo; There is a kind of, uh, there is a kind of shadow falling over me. It is a quality of the- it is a quality of the world. I am- I am sitting in the shadow of terrible things.\nSATAH: A woman appearing to me in my dreams. Mmm! I was like, is it she\u0026rsquo;s trying to poison me against my husband or that kind of thing? And then I was like, one of the other sort of key phrases that was included in the interpretation book was, like, to recollect something, to remember something. And so the idea– like, I have visions of the future, right? And, like, playing with the idea of that in that, like, I keep having dreams… that my memories are wrong or confused. Like I\u0026rsquo;m sacrificing the past for the future.\nOkay, again, sort of just playing around with writing it out, seeing what feels good, the enemy that I\u0026rsquo;ve come up with is \u0026ldquo;A powerful witch who visits me in my dreams wants me to give up my past to gain greater access to the future.\u0026rdquo;\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s the idea that like I\u0026rsquo;m being visited in my dreams… and I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s… a real person or if it\u0026rsquo;s just, like, my own dark power sort of, like, calling me closer? And basically is saying, like, \u0026ldquo;You have these visions of likely- the likeliest answers to your question. You have these powers. They could be greater. It would come at a cost, but maybe it\u0026rsquo;s worth it.\n\u0026ldquo;It is a great cost, though.\u0026rdquo; [Laughs]\nHB: We are a, uh… we are a young woman bedeviled by omens. Our fate is… we are a cursed young lady who has to watch out for this seemingly cursed looking keep, which is very exciting to me.\nSATAH: Oh, nuh, there is an Arthurian name generator on fantasynamegenerators.com. Thank you, fantasynamegenerators.com. I love you.\nMy goodness. Affirmations voice: I can pronounce these.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go… let\u0026rsquo;s look up Astigan as a name to see whomst… a Palworld– a Palworld creature? No, I think we\u0026rsquo;re good. Yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s go with Astigan. Lady Astigan… let\u0026rsquo;s combine two of these. Arthridin and Helivir for Heladin. Lady Astigan Heladin. I\u0026rsquo;m a hermit and my enemy is the moon! [Laughs]\nHB: How will we manage the extremely horrific circumstances that we are placed in? Only time will tell. And also, you know, the cards will tell too.\nBREAK SATAH: Hello again! I never quite know how to come into the break for some reason.\nIf you like Good Society or Monsterhearts– which is actually a pretty good intersection for this series as a whole– let me tell you: both people joining me on this series have some stuff for you on itch.io.\nHB is our second ever returning guest! If you\u0026rsquo;re as absurdly delighted as I am by their insane narrative swings, please also go listen to the Unplugged Survivor series where they and Darling Demon Eclipse join me in building out an absurd post-apocalyptica that happens to involve a strange amount of One Direction? You can also hear them on Indie Mixtape, a Moonshot network podcast about indie games, and get all of their games for free at gm36.itch.io. I particularly want to bring your attention to They Call This The City, a game that– to put it as simply as possible– builds a city out of graphs. It is unique and weird and great, just like its designer. I am so, so glad that HB could be here again and oh my god, the stuff that they do in this– you\u0026rsquo;ll hear it. You\u0026rsquo;ll hear it pretty much immediately. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible.\nBefore Chloe Sobel came into my life, I missed them so bad. To Honour and Obey was on my list for Folio specifically for when I could finally get her on as a guest and I\u0026rsquo;m so happy it worked out. He makes games about horror and romance and intimacy and you can find them all on smallstories.io. At some point this summer, they\u0026rsquo;ll be releasing a Gothic fiction haunted house hack of Good Society called Within the Walls, which is so fucking exciting because hearing Chloe go off about, like 19th, 20th century ghost shit is one of the greatest joys that can be found in this life, so her work in that space is a guaranteed treat. You can follow them on Bluesky at smallstoriesgames.bsky.social. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I said that plug thing right but I honestly wasn\u0026rsquo;t really paying attention to the words I was saying because I was thinking about Chloe talking about ghosts and how good it is.\nAs for me, you\u0026rsquo;re currently listening to my show– thank you! My name\u0026rsquo;s Satah. I\u0026rsquo;m a TTRPG editor and designer, podcast wrangler, and musician. My singer-songwriter acoustic goth broadway bedroom doom pop feelings project people you meet outside of bars released an EP at the end of last year and a full length-album at the end of February for record production month. Check out my work at gaygothvibes.online, follow me on Bluesky at posatahchips.gaygothvibes.online, and, I dunno, give me a shout if you need your TTRPG book or podcast edited.\nLet us turn now to our tales of woe… probably.\nGAME: ACT ONE HB: Now we enter into\nCHLOE: Act One!\nALL: Pentacles.\nSATAH: In the Wanderers deck, the analogue to pentacles is stones.\n\u0026ldquo;You kiss him goodbye, playing the dutiful wife until he has gone away like so much dust on the wind.\nHB: \u0026ldquo;You bite your tongue when he tells you he\u0026rsquo;s going away to fight evil. He is blind to the evil that exists within the walls of his own keep, to the battles he is now leaving you to fight by yourself. But the bards will sing of him.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;But the bards will sing of him.\u0026rdquo;\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;But the bards will sing of him, and never of you.\u0026rdquo;\nHB \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;And never of you.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;And just like that, you are alone.\u0026rdquo;\nCHLOE: Alright, now I draw three cards from the deck of pentacles. \u0026ldquo;Answer the questions they ask and assign tokens if appropriate.\u0026rdquo;\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;If you do not have an obvious answer to a prompt, draw a card from the major arcana deck. Use this to guide your answers.\u0026rdquo;\nCHLOE: It\u0026rsquo;s fun playing an Anamnesis game that is completely a solo game because so far my only experience with the system is Tangled Blessings, which is a fantastic game but also, like, it has duet rules, um and so that is how I have been playing in this system, so it\u0026rsquo;s really cool to get to see, like, not just a different take on the same system, but also one that is, like, a solo game.\nHB: Let\u0026rsquo;s draw– I\u0026rsquo;m gonna do this one by one. Or should I do all three of them?\nCHLOE: So I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn the two, the three, and the ten.\nHB: Let\u0026rsquo;s do one by one.\nSATAH: First card is eight.\nHB: First up is the queen of pentacles.\nCHLOE: So we\u0026rsquo;ll- we\u0026rsquo;ll start with the two.\nHB: OH… \u0026ldquo;You have a terrible secret that you have been trying to keep from your husband since the night you were married. What is it, and how could it ruin everything?\u0026rdquo; Okay, perfect. Perfect. Delightful. [Laughing] Oh boy.\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;As he rides away, you think about the one person you wish was here to offer you support and wisdom. Why are they not with you right now? Do you cave in and in a moment of weakness ask them to come?\u0026rdquo; I think… I\u0026rsquo;ll just, you know, I\u0026rsquo;ll start dealing with my enemy early and often, I suppose.\nI wish that the wicked magician who was a contestant for my hand was here to offer me support and wisdom, because I think the thing is that one of the reasons that he is my enemy now is because we had known each other for years before I ever even knew my husband existed. And we were lovers, and he took it to mean that when the time was right, we would marry.\nAnd I never said this to him– and I think I feel quite bad about it now from potentially misleading him– but I think that I never had any intention of marrying him because I knew that it would only bring me grief. He was wonderful to pass the time with, but not someone to stake my life to.\nBut he was always very supportive of me and he is, because he\u0026rsquo;s a magician, he is wise. Like, he… ironically, I think, does a lot of divinatory magic and so he\u0026rsquo;s very, like- he\u0026rsquo;s historically been very well placed as, like, an advisor to noble- to nobles. Unfortunately, he could not foresee that I would jilt him. Or he did and he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to believe it.\nUm, so that- he\u0026rsquo;s not with me right now because we had a falling out. He\u0026rsquo;s not interested in being supportive to me anymore. He is interested in destroying what I have and potentially making me crawl back to him.\nUm… do I cave in? No. I- I stay strong, because once again, I remind myself that this is a bad idea. I rejected him for a reason, and… I also need to like– I think I need to partially learn a bit how to stand on my own. Like, there\u0026rsquo;s part of me that\u0026rsquo;s frightened by being on my own when my husband\u0026rsquo;s not really taking seriously all the danger and threats around us? But at the same time, I think I\u0026rsquo;m sort of, like, looking forward to, I guess, proving myself.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;A maid is standing behind you, holding your cloak and a few other small items. Who is she? Do you trust her?\u0026rdquo;\nMy immediate thought, because of her \u0026ldquo;holding small items,\u0026rdquo; is that we are doing something magic-y. I am just going to look at, like, the numerology page in the Wanderer deck book to see if it, like, has anything to say. \u0026ldquo;Meditation and reflection.\u0026rdquo; Perfect. Yep, that\u0026rsquo;s great.\nYeah, I have this image of us being in like… the middle of a field. It\u0026rsquo;s probably, like, the middle of the gardens in this estate… let me just double check what a keep is.\nA keep is a tower. Okay. Does it necessarily have… like, an estate? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just the tower. Yeah, perfect. In that case, we\u0026rsquo;re not in a field or anything. We\u0026rsquo;re on the top of the tower in the midday sun. I took my cloak off because it\u0026rsquo;s so hot. And I\u0026rsquo;m trying a ritual.\nI think I don\u0026rsquo;t normally really do rituals. I might maneuver a situation for my powers to be relevant, like having conversations in the sun or by a fire, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I often do it on purpose, and I think that just, like, this whole situation has put me in a state of heightened anxiety that I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Maybe I should try and concentrate on this a little bit more purposefully.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd this is interesting because it also– I think I\u0026rsquo;m very purposefully trying not to think about this witch that\u0026rsquo;s been visiting me in my dreams, right? Like, asking me to grow my powers, but at the cost of- at a great cost of something. In my past. I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;Nope! That isn\u0026rsquo;t even a problem. That isn\u0026rsquo;t- that\u0026rsquo;s fake.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so… what is it that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to answer? I think it\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s as simple as, like… my husband just left… and I think my visions are often the type that are very immediate, you know? It\u0026rsquo;s- it\u0026rsquo;s harder to know the further out it goes, and so I can\u0026rsquo;t just be like, \u0026ldquo;Is he gonna be okay?\u0026rdquo;\nBut we\u0026rsquo;re- we\u0026rsquo;re standing on the top of this tower… [Typing] when were magnifying glasses invented…\nHB: I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a big swing.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m a werewolf.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s right! I think I may, uh– I think I do sometimes turn into a wolf, and I am driven to consume human flesh, which is a huge problem. I am genuinely and very literally cursed, and if- I think if people find this out about me, there\u0026rsquo;s going to obviously be quite a reckoning.\nMy husband, of course, does not actually know this. There is a… he knows about the prophecy, I think, and he knows, you know, that I was found alone in my keep where everybody else had been destroyed by a terrible beast, or ripped to shreds by a terrible beast, and I was the sole survivor found bloodied in a torn dress in the keep. And, you know. Credit to him, he did not immediately infer from that that I was some kind of- that I would turn into a horrible beast sometimes.\nAnd how could it ruin everything? Well, obviously it could happen again. I think I don\u0026rsquo;t precisely know what makes it happen. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is strictly just the full moon. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a more complicated series of events, and I cannot necessarily predict ahead of time what they will be. I\u0026rsquo;m going to- I\u0026rsquo;m going to now and again turn into a beast and just hope that not too many people are killed. Especially now that I\u0026rsquo;m pregnant, which could be… which could also reflect very badly on my son.\nSATAH: I\u0026rsquo;m so out of my depth… [Laughing] in this genre. I\u0026rsquo;m just searching things like, \u0026ldquo;What year is King Arthur set in?\u0026rdquo;\nOkay. I can\u0026rsquo;t focus too hard on this. I\u0026rsquo;ll go crazy.\nMagnifying glasses… have been explicitly referred to since at least 424 BC… there\u0026rsquo;s evidence of them throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean basin over several millennia… great.\nSo all of this is to say, I have a magnifying glass. [Laughing] And I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get the sun to light a candle, is what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. Maybe a couple- like, a few candles. That\u0026rsquo;s- some of the small objects that this maid is holding are… like, various types of lenses, I think, and other candles. And I want to– I\u0026rsquo;m theorising that if I can get the sun to light this candle, I will be bringing the fire of the sun into the nighttime and then it\u0026rsquo;ll be more powerful? You know?\nAnd maybe I\u0026rsquo;m also trying to keep some of those dreams at bay. Like I\u0026rsquo;m like, if I could light a fire with this candle and have it overnight and it\u0026rsquo;ll sort of… keep the sun with me. But I- I want to- I want to have this special sun candle to, like– I think ask myself questions. Like, I- in the mirror. Like, \u0026ldquo;Has my husband gotten to his destination safely?\u0026rdquo; and that kind of thing. You know?\nA lot of- this is all super theoretical. But this is what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do. And so this maid is helping me. And I think I do trust her. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do weird magic in front of her if i didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nAnd I think, in fact, like– she was the one- she sort of, like, had been watching me for a while and- and found a way to very politely raise, like, \u0026ldquo;Well, you know, where I\u0026rsquo;m from,\u0026rdquo; or, \u0026ldquo;My mom always found that she could find secrets in rivers,\u0026rdquo; and that kind of thing. Just, like, really talked around the idea that, hey, magic is pretty mundane to me. And we have been, like, quietly getting to know each other and trust each other a bit, and she is now, like, interested in helping me do this, or at least, like, I can trust her to do it.\nAnd I didn\u0026rsquo;t solve a problem exactly, but my powers or my strength did come up. So should I give it a token?\nHB: I think this is pretty safely a win for the enemy. Gotta put a token on the World.\nSATAH: No, I don\u0026rsquo;t think so, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually solve anything with it. I\u0026rsquo;m just experimenting with it.\nHB: Let\u0026rsquo;s try drawing the next card. The Nine of Pentacles. Okay! [Laughs] On that topic, \u0026ldquo;Your husband has left a man-at-arms to protect you. Who is he? Why don\u0026rsquo;t you trust him?\u0026rdquo;\nYeah, I think this man is a bandit that my husband defeated in combat, and therefore earned the loyalty of. I think that\u0026rsquo;s just how it works these days, you know? You kind of beat somebody in a duel, and then they\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;Well, it seems that you\u0026rsquo;re very powerful and strong, and I\u0026rsquo;m honestly kind of into you now.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of the vibe here, where he did not take this man-at-arms along, and I think the thing of it is is that– and the reason why I don\u0026rsquo;t trust him– is that it seems he\u0026rsquo;s very displeased at being left here with me. He is like, \u0026ldquo;Hmm. I was looking forward to going on a quest of heroic proportions with the man that I might be a little bit in love with.\u0026rdquo; And I think he is, as a result of that, kind of very sullen, irritable. I think he gives me strange looks now and again.\nAnd of course, he also suspects that something is amiss with me, which is honestly one of the better reasons not to trust him.\nBut I think… actually, no, I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s really a problem to be solved here. I simply don\u0026rsquo;t trust him, and that is it. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a token for either the enemy or my strength. He is just kind of around here, but it is good to have somebody around. It\u0026rsquo;s just that I feel as though he will either snitch on me, kill me, or do something of that nature, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s, you know, kind of a suboptimal way to be living- kind of a suboptimal situation to be living in.\nSATAH: So the next pentacle is a three.\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;There is one place in the castle you are afraid to go without protection.\nCHLOE \u0026amp; SATAH: \u0026ldquo;Where is it and why will you never go there?\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;What danger does ignoring it bring, if any?\u0026rdquo;\nCHLOE: Hmm…\nSATAH: There\u0026rsquo;s, like, a corridor that\u0026rsquo;s really windy and has a tendency to blow candles out, and lanterns, if you\u0026rsquo;re sort of walking around at night. They always go out. And there\u0026rsquo;s, like- there are, you know, sconces put at the end of the hall to, like, relight your torch or whatever? Like, this is just a known quantity.\nAnd so most people just traverse it. It\u0026rsquo;s fine. Like it isn\u0026rsquo;t awesome, it\u0026rsquo;s annoying and it\u0026rsquo;s dark, but most people just traverse it.\nI… don\u0026rsquo;t trust like that. [Laughs] I think even, like… maybe I- I was always a little trepidatious walking through it, and then one day as I was walking, my candle went out and as my eyes adjusted, it just, like… the moon was fully framed in this window at the end of the hall, part of the thing that like lets the draft in. And I was just seized with this terror, considering, like, my enemy being represented by the moon, you know, that I was just like… nope! This is the moon\u0026rsquo;s hall. The moon watches here. And absolutely not. I\u0026rsquo;m not going there.\nAnd I think that this- this, like- I can still get everywhere in the castle, but it does mean that at night, I have to take long ways around often. Like, this is, like, a sort of central hall, and I often have to, like, take much longer routes if I\u0026rsquo;m going between places alone. And I think I will go with other people, but I still prefer not to. [Laughing]\n\u0026ldquo;What danger does ignoring it bring, if any?\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t think it brings any danger in particular, at least not yet. Maybe in the future it will? Like, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m right that this is a bad omen and scary? But right now it\u0026rsquo;s just a hall. That might come up later.\nI guess I could say there might be some– there\u0026rsquo;s social danger in that. Like, I annoy people by wanting to take long routes around. I maybe even sometimes ask them, like, if they\u0026rsquo;re bringing food to me late at night or something, I might ask them… for not ask them, but heavily imply I would prefer not- for them not to go through that hall.\nAnd… it definitely will become, like, a place that people can gather and be assured that I will not overhear or see them. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that we\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to a point where, like, I\u0026rsquo;m in active danger from any amount of conspiracy at the moment, but, like, that\u0026rsquo;s in the air for sure. That\u0026rsquo;s all there.\nCHLOE: I think that there is a tower room that I refuse to go to, because something in me just says that that place is dangerous. And the thing is that it is also dangerous to ignore it.\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s maybe a legend that someone died horribly in that tower room and that their ghost haunts it, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s true, but there is something… corrupted about that room. And I do not want to go there. I have no interest in it.\nAnd I think it\u0026rsquo;s also– it\u0026rsquo;s… my husband\u0026rsquo;s sort of private sanctum? Like, that\u0026rsquo;s where he keeps a lot of the things that are most precious to him. And it is in some ways a relief to have him gone so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to argue with him about why I don\u0026rsquo;t ever want to go into this room.\nSATAH: And my third pentacle is… the four.\nCHLOE: Ten.\nHB: The page of pentacles. \u0026ldquo;There is an activity that you are fond of that you cannot perform whilst your husband is around for fear of his disapproval. What is it and why are you looking forward to doing it again?\u0026rdquo; Hmm. Let\u0026rsquo;s see. Let\u0026rsquo;s see, let\u0026rsquo;s see, let\u0026rsquo;s see… [Laughing] let me check the safety tab of this recording again.\nCHLOE: \u0026ldquo;The steward of the castle looks at you with calculating eyes. What does he want from you?\u0026rdquo;\nI mean, I think what he wants is for me to be too ignorant a housekeeper to notice that he is… I think, taking the people who– I think basically taking the, like, the peasants who labour for this castle for more than he should.\nHe thinks that I won\u0026rsquo;t notice. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want me to notice. He wants to believe that I\u0026rsquo;m not intelligent. And, hone– you know, mileage may vary on how intelligent people think I am or how intelligent I am, but I can tell that he is cheating people, and that eventually this is going to be a problem.\nHB: Okay. The activity that we do that our husband does not approve of is that I think we like to take solitary moonlight baths out in the nearby body of water. So in this case, that would be, I think, the nearby river.\nAnd our husband objects to this on a number of criteria. The first is that we have to do this alone. The second is, of course, that we are washing ourselves in essentially a public place. And the third is, of course, that this is all a ritual in which we call out to the Virgin Mary who lives in the water.\nOf course, we are– myself and my husband are both good Christians. However, there is a certain mismatch in our particular interpretation of Christian doctrine. In our case, we do believe in the Virgin Mary who lives in the nearby body of water, and he is… perhaps a little disquieted by it. I think to him, this reads a little bit like idolatry, or at least different from the kind of rites that he is accustomed to performing., and I think he, on some level, distrusts it.\nHowever, I think for us, I am going to mark a token on my strength, because I think once we set our mind to it, once we realise that there is a kind of opening that we could just, like, you know… go and do it again, and that this would soothe our anxiety about, you know, where everything is going for us, I think we head out there and we resume our ritual. We, you know, experience communion with the Virgin Mary, we feel refreshed. There is a… I think we feel good for the first time in months, where there\u0026rsquo;s a sense of, I\u0026rsquo;m here, I\u0026rsquo;m in the lake, I\u0026rsquo;m having a good bath, and maybe it\u0026rsquo;ll all be alright in the end.\nAnd we come back, and I think the man-at-arms we are tasked to lodge with notes that our mood is substantially lifted for the next few days, and is, of course, immediately reflexively suspicious of this. He, of course, has heard about the prophecy. He wonders what could possibly be going on.\nSATAH: \u0026ldquo;As you stand by the gate, a man watches you from a window. What about his gaze makes your skin crawl?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As you stand by the gate, a man watches…\u0026rdquo; like, a window, like, in my… in this castle? Do I just live in part of the castle? Where- where is this- where\u0026rsquo;s this man? Is he in my house? Because I don\u0026rsquo;t like that.\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna pull from the major arcana, because this– the- the setup of this, I\u0026rsquo;m really unsure of.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve pulled the Hierophant. Hierophant. Why do I– I\u0026rsquo;m always bad at pronouncing that.\n\u0026ldquo;Hierophant, spiritual authority.\u0026rdquo; Oh, shit. It\u0026rsquo;s a priest. [Laughing] Or something like that. Like… yeah. Okay.\nAs I was sort of implying with, like, I won\u0026rsquo;t just talk about magic to everybody, it isn\u0026rsquo;t… like, I, uh, witch- witchin\u0026rsquo; is looked down upon. [Laughs] I think it\u0026rsquo;s one of those things where, like… I- I know. I cannot stress- I cannot stress enough that I just am so– I don\u0026rsquo;t know this genre very well, and so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna say some stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna say some stuff that is true about my world that might not be correct for your standard Arthurian legends, and at\u0026rsquo;s okay. Clearly I\u0026rsquo;m being defensive about it, but I know it\u0026rsquo;s okay because I\u0026rsquo;m playing a tabletop role-playing game.\nBut I think it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing where like– uh, I guess I\u0026rsquo;m a little bit inspired by Ursula K. Le Guin\u0026rsquo;s Earthsea series… but it\u0026rsquo;s not as strict. It\u0026rsquo;s like– it isn\u0026rsquo;t that men who are magic users are respected and women aren\u0026rsquo;t, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s a class thing in part, you know? It\u0026rsquo;s- if you are, like, a wealthy man or woman of means and it\u0026rsquo;s almost, like, a leisurely intellectual activity, magic is cool.\nBut a lot of magic is seen as, like… the more utilitarian stuff is really looked down on. Like, people who are using magic to speed up labour, especially, like– you hear tales of a woman being caught using her, like, elemental water powers to do laundry a little bit more quickly so that she can, like, read a book by the lakeside? And it is, like, something that is talked of with disgust.\nAnd it- I clearly, I mean- I have this castle. I live in this castle. My husband has this castle. But I think that what that would imply is that my background is not quite as royal, and so it\u0026rsquo;s something that I would have to be very careful of.\nAnd also, like, I\u0026rsquo;m not just doing fancy party tricks. I bet that that\u0026rsquo;s something that, like– a woman of my social position doing magic at a party to, like, do some lights and stuff would be, like, gently, condescendingly almost applauded. Like, \u0026ldquo;Ohh, that\u0026rsquo;s lovely. Look at her fun little trick.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s like learning to play piano and only showing it off for… clout. Kind of thing.\nMy magic isn\u0026rsquo;t like that. My magic is not a party trick. It could be, I guess. I could be a weird human lie detector, but I think I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in playing around with it like that.\nThis man doesn\u0026rsquo;t know all of this, but I think that my behaviour has started to get a little bit stranger, right? It\u0026rsquo;s been a few weeks since my husband left, and I\u0026rsquo;m emboldened by my trusting relationship with my handmaid who will help me do weird magic.\nAnd I don\u0026rsquo;t think people necessarily know that I\u0026rsquo;m doing magic, but they do think that I am eccentric, and increasingly so. Very particular about fires being lit, how they\u0026rsquo;re lit, what order they\u0026rsquo;re lit in, when they\u0026rsquo;re put out.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s just enough that if some sort of priest, we\u0026rsquo;ll say, heard tell of this, he might start to get a little bit suspicious that I\u0026rsquo;ve got some, uh, dirty magic going on. Perhaps even… ooh! It\u0026rsquo;s– I\u0026rsquo;m very focused on fire, apparently, so that\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s givin\u0026rsquo; some devil red flags, you know? That\u0026rsquo;s- that\u0026rsquo;s some pact with the devil type shit.\nSo, yes. This is a priest. He\u0026rsquo;s in my house?? The \u0026ldquo;watching you from the window\u0026rdquo; thing has really tripped me up, clearly. But I guess he could just- he could be visiting to make sure that I\u0026rsquo;m okay..?\nOr maybe he\u0026rsquo;s, like, visiting one of the servants, basically, right? Like the people who work in this castle. He\u0026rsquo;s visiting to be like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, your mother died three months ago. I\u0026rsquo;m just checking in to see if you\u0026rsquo;re okay,\u0026rdquo; and while he\u0026rsquo;s been doing this, he, like, hears some of this gossip.\nAnd I have been just walking around, I think, inside of… the fence? The walls. I\u0026rsquo;m standing by a gate when this happens. So I think I\u0026rsquo;ve just been walking around the inside. And I look up and he\u0026rsquo;s just staring down at me in deep suspicion. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I\u0026rsquo;ve done wrong, but I do feel that I have done something deeply wrong, and that\u0026rsquo;s unnerving. And I just duck my head away from him and keep walking.\nHB: So yeah! First month. Didn\u0026rsquo;t go so bad.
