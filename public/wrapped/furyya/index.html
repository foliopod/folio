unsurprising that the categories with two rolls were more common, but very funny that the worse one was significantly more frequent, in no small part because of the situations imperius kept finding himself in– sorry buddy\ni spent some time calculating which numbers were the most likely to succeed, but it ended up being hampered by the fact that i only have a complete record of the results, not the rolls. as an example, if you wager 3 and 5, then roll just a 5, that’s a success for the 5 but a failure for the 3– but with the data i have, it shows up as a success for both. i didn’t make a chart for it because that makes it pretty meaningless (unlike the rest of this data, OF COURSE), but it looks something like this:\nbook of fate rolls\nit did genuinely surprise me that matt rolled in the book of fate more than i did bc, you know. i love to roll dice. in part it’s because he fully generated so many NPCs, which takes three or four rolls\nof alyssa’s five book of fate rolls, four were to find a location. three of those gave them the result of “the gardens.” that raises its popularity in the locations table, tying it with “drip nightclub”– the only location all four of us rolled\nthe results from the clans table might be the funniest one to me, because there ARE six possible results. calamity is calamity-focused!! i love that this resulted in double agents \u0026 internal conspiracies.\nthe other ones are a bit too piecemeal to justify the space for their charts but here are some tables– i’m fascinated that we actually rolled every result on the events table \u0026 never rolled that there were four of a given threat\nwagers\nwhen you do a challenge roll, you have to call your shot by wagering what number is going to come up on the die. alyssa was the only person to wager every number at least once. i never wagered a two or a four because i don’t like them \u0026 stuck mostly with my good friends three \u0026 five, occasionally dabbling in one \u0026 six when it seemed thematically appropriate\nyou can spend fury to wager two numbers instead– i don’t have a particularly intuitive grasp of math \u0026 statistics so it’s basically magic to me that it fully flips the likelihood of success\nok i think that’s it i love this series \u0026 i’m so so so glad alyssa \u0026 matt played so differently from each other \u0026 from me while still making amazing stories because that’s what the show is all about babey!!!\n",

				 <p>the final episode of the <a href="https://oddpress.itch.io/furyya">furyya</a> series went live today!! i picked the game up a few months ago because it looked cool as hell, obviously. when its designer, uoshi, got brought on as the layout artist for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galacticgoingrogue/galactic-and-going-rogue-two-ttrpgs-of-war-among-the-stars">galactic &amp; going rogue</a> i thought it would be fun to have the series overlap with that crowdfunder!!</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-cover.png"/></figure>
<p>this series took 27 hours to edit. it underwent a lot of rearranging because the open-ended nature of the game made it much more of a puzzle to put together than the majority of the other games on the show, which tend to have very deliberate structures. it was super satisfying &amp; i&rsquo;m pretty happy with how it ended up, though i think i&rsquo;m going to take a different approach to this type of game in the future so that i don&rsquo;t end up having to shift chunks around while working to the extent that stuff like this happens, where i accidentally started the third episode with the ending of the second episode,</p>

<p><strong>stats</strong></p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-character-stats.png"/></figure>
<p>not a bad array if we&rsquo;d been a team tbh. unsurprisingly, we mostly used what we were good at (whether because of our innate abilities or ummm equipment we stole). shout out to speck for never even once attempting to have insight on a situation.</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-1.png"/></figure>
<p><strong>rolls</strong></p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-2.png"/></figure>
<p>at first i was surprised that matt rolled nearly as much as i did bc i love to roll dice, but then realised that he set himself up to roll three times per log &amp; made eleven of them. our ratios are something like 4.75 rolls per log (alyssa), 3.7 rolls per log (matt), &amp; 9.2 rolls per log (satah), despite me making my final entry into two entries because i&rsquo;m weird about numbers. i love to roll dice!!</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the breakdown of what those rolls were:</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-3.png"/></figure>
<p>&ldquo;book of fate&rdquo; is obviously any rolls on the tables in the <em>book of fate</em> pamphlet, &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; includes rolling for failure &amp; combat, &amp; &ldquo;other&rdquo; is when we just sort of chose to roll dice to figure something out despite it not being in the rules (or, in one case, because of a typo in the rules that the player later noticed &amp; mentioned).</p>
<p><strong>challenge rolls</strong></p>
<p>given how hard the mechanics of this game lean towards failure, it&rsquo;s indicative of a lot of resource-spending that we broke almost even on successes &amp; failures</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-4.png"/></figure>
<p>we were mostly rolling two or three dice on challenges, which makes sense given stat arrays. i guess it&rsquo;s logical that three dice is about when the success/failure rate starts to get pretty even. shout out to the two rolls with the fewest &amp; most dice both being failures</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-5.png"/></figure>
<p>when we did fail, we mostly did&hellip; pretty bad! unsurprising that the categories with two rolls were more common, but very funny that the worse one was significantly more frequent, in no small part because of the situations imperius kept finding himself in&ndash; sorry buddy</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-6.png"/></figure>
<p>i spent some time calculating which numbers were the most likely to succeed, but it ended up being hampered by the fact that i only have a complete record of the <em>results</em>, not the <em>rolls</em>. as an example, if you wager 3 and 5, then roll just a 5, that&rsquo;s a success for the 5 but a failure for the 3– but with the data i have, it shows up as a success for both. i didn&rsquo;t make a chart for it because that makes it pretty meaningless (unlike the rest of this data, OF COURSE), but it looks something like this:</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-7.png"/></figure>
<p><strong>book of fate rolls</strong></p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-8.png"/></figure>
<p>it did genuinely surprise me that matt rolled in the <em>book of fate</em> more than i did bc, you know. i love to roll dice. in part it&rsquo;s because he fully generated so many NPCs, which takes three or four rolls</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-9.png"/></figure>
<p>of alyssa&rsquo;s five <em>book of fate</em> rolls, four were to find a location. three of those gave them the result of &ldquo;the gardens.&rdquo; that raises its popularity in the locations table, tying it with &ldquo;drip nightclub&rdquo;&ndash; the only location all four of us rolled</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-10.png"/></figure>
<p>the results from the clans table might be the funniest one to me, because there ARE six possible results. calamity is calamity-focused!! i love that this resulted in double agents &amp; internal conspiracies.</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-11.png"/></figure>
<p>the other ones are a bit too piecemeal to justify the space for their charts but here are some tables&ndash; i&rsquo;m fascinated that we actually rolled every result on the events table &amp; never rolled that there were four of a given threat</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-12.png"/></figure>
<p><strong>wagers</strong></p>
<p>when you do a challenge roll, you have to call your shot by wagering what number is going to come up on the die. alyssa was the only person to wager every number at least once. i never wagered a two or a four because i don&rsquo;t like them &amp; stuck mostly with my good friends three &amp; five, occasionally dabbling in one &amp; six when it seemed thematically appropriate</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-13.png"/></figure>
<p>you can spend fury to wager two numbers instead&ndash; i don&rsquo;t have a particularly intuitive grasp of math &amp; statistics so it&rsquo;s basically magic to me that it fully flips the likelihood of success</p>


    <figure><img src="https://foliopod.github.io/folio/images/wrapped/furyya-chart-14.png"/></figure>

<p>i love this series &amp; i&rsquo;m so so so glad alyssa &amp; matt played so differently from each other &amp; from me while still making amazing stories because that&rsquo;s what the show is all about babey!!!</p>
