				 <p>the final episode of the <a href="https://noroadhome.itch.io/alone-among-the-stars">alone among the stars</a> series just went live! here&rsquo;s a wrap-up post talking a little bit about the production &amp; showing some game data. bc of course, as a general life rule, i simply love to make a spreadsheet about it 🖤</p>
<p>the three playthroughs were recorded in september, october, &amp; december of 2024, then released in january 2025, which i believe makes it the series that had slowest ramp then most sudden launch so far 🏃‍♂️</p>

<p><strong>discoveries</strong></p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to believe that averages &amp; statistics are real while you&rsquo;re living them, but while our per-planet die rolls varied significantly, we all ended up with almost exactly the same amount of discoveries</p>


    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-chart-1.png"/></figure>
<p>the way that i lay out sections in the show obviously changes a lot depending on the format of the game. discrete discoveries as segments was pretty clearly the way forward here, but i wasn&rsquo;t sure at first how to deal with the varying numbers. the rules i decided on were, as much as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>no player does two discoveries in a row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each player pops up semi-regularly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everyone finishes planets at the same time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>my specific ADHD black hole of a working memory brain cannot do this kind of work internally &amp; doesn&rsquo;t even really like doing it digitally, so here&rsquo;s how i laid it out&ndash; i think this is pretty much what you hear in the show, unless something really wasn&rsquo;t flowing as i worked through it!</p>


    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-whiteboard.jpg"/></figure>
<p>i love you whiteboards!!! i&rsquo;d be nothing without you whiteboards!!! yaaaay whiteboards!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>circumstances</strong></p>
<p>dusty used the roll for &ldquo;how you discovered [X]&rdquo; to determine their approach to the planet, with a more narrative approach to how they found each thing on it, so they had fewer in total &amp; ended up with a fairly even split</p>
<p>![]

    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-chart-2.png"/></figure></p>
<p>as much as jess&rsquo; character loved coming upon things suddenly, ultimately her journey wore on her &amp; she spent a little more time at rest than anything else</p>


    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-chart-3.png"/></figure>
<p>however&hellip; i remain the absolute royal of resting. my character was, without a doubt, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/foliopod/773027261413818368">saturday. fuckin&rsquo;. chillin&rsquo;.</a></p>


    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-chart-4.png"/></figure>
<p><strong>locations</strong></p>
<p>we discovered things at all thirteen possible locations, but some were much more common than others!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>frequency</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>most common: &ldquo;floating in the air&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;in the desert&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>least common: &ldquo;under the light of the moon(s)&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>spread</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;floating in the air&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;on the snowy peak of a mountain&rdquo; are the only two that we all hit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jess was the only one to find something &ldquo;by a gentle river&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dusty was the only one to find something &ldquo;under the light of the moon(s)&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i was chilling way too hard to find anything unique</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-chart-5.png"/></figure>
<p>somehow fittingly for the space cowboy, dusty spent a meaningful amount of their game discovering stuff that was floating in the air, but they also favoured cliff faces &amp; deep water</p>


    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-chart-6.png"/></figure>
<p>jess was the only person to pull all four possible instances of one location, &amp; generally spent the most time in extreme conditions or beside a moving body of water</p>


    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-chart-7.png"/></figure>
<p>my spread was pretty even, which i&rsquo;m crediting to my superior card shuffling skills, despite that having nothing to do with it &amp; knowing for a fact that at least one of the other players has some amount of cardistry skills &amp; is certainly on all technical levels better at shuffling cards than me</p>


    <figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/folio/images/wrapped/alone-among-the-stars-chart-8.png"/></figure>
<p>that&rsquo;s it for now! these are the episodes that have most made me wish there were an animation budget so far&ndash; the visual descriptions were just so strange &amp; evocative. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MgLujPdwILOl0DYcHBht3nASZQbH0PgtNqVNxWrcyr4/edit?usp=sharing">here&rsquo;s the data</a> if you want to make a copy &amp; find other weird correlations &amp; whatever!!</p>
